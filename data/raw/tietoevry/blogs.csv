"Shangqianzi Teng: A passionate advocate for diversity and, gender balance in the tech industry.",/en/blog/2023/09/career-story-shangqianzi-teng/,Meet our people / Shangqianzi Teng / 19.9.2023,"With a passion for technology and a master's degree in hand, she embarked on a remarkable journey. Over the past 13 years, she has held various roles within the telecom industry, which led her to her current pivotal role as a Product Guardian at Tietoevry Create China.- I had a growing interest in technology and the mechanisms behind it. This eventually led me to study electronic engineering in college, and ignited my passion for pursuing a career in technology, Shangqianzi says.Shangqianzi's current role isn’t merely confined to designing technical solutions. It involves blending creativity and, problem-solving while working with a team of developers, project managers, and other stakeholders. Together they create innovative solutions that meet client requirements within set timelines and, budgets.Shangqianzi expressed that her interest lies in exploring emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to develop innovative solutions for complex problems in the telecom industry. She is always striving to learn and grow in her career. Therefore, her advice to all aspiring women in tech is to cultivate a network of supportive mentors and role models and to never cease their pursuit of knowledge.- I have not faced difficulties related to being a woman in tech, mainly because the culture of Tietoevry is inclusive, and my managers are open-minded, Shangqianzi says.- The biggest prejudice about women in tech is that they're not as technically skilled as men. This prejudice is kept alive by unconscious bias and discriminatory attitudes that have no place in a brainpower-based industry, Shangqianzi firmly believes.As we see, beyond her technical expertise, Shangqianzi has emerged as a passionate advocate for diversity and, gender balance in the tech industry.- To improve gender balance in tech, it's essential to create a supportive culture that values diversity and inclusivity. Here are some suggestions:Build programs that provide mentorship and networking opportunities for women in tech.
Make sure that job postings and hiring practices are unbiased and focused on qualifications - not gender.
Create supportive work environments that foster a diverse and inclusive culture and, offer career growth opportunities for everyone.As we emphasize the importance of diversity in tech, it's also essential to foster self-awareness and combat stereotypes and biases. This process begins internally, urging everyone to confront their own self-preconceptions. Shangqianzi's transformative personal experience exemplifies this.- I was kind of an indoor girl and not interested in sports before. Last summer, I joined a parent-child trip, hiked along the Great Wall of the Han Dynasty, and enjoyed a breathtaking view of the surrounding landscapes. After that, I started to enjoy hiking and exploring the great outdoors. And I learned a lesson from it - don’t easily judge yourself, as you might surprise even yourself with what you're capable of achieving, Shangqianzi ends.Join our team and reinvent the world.

Accelerating sustainability ambitions at Tietoevry,/en/blog/2023/09/accelerating-sustainability-ambitions-at-tietoevry/,Sustainability / Ida Bohman Steenberg / 19.9.2023,"Congratulations on the new role! What sustainability topics are most pressing on your working table currently?Climate, circular economy, and human rights are essential in today's corporate landscape, and also on my workdesk daily. These areas define a responsible and ethical approach to business as well as lay the foundation for long-term success and resilience. Aligning with current and upcoming legislation, such as the EU taxonomy and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, is highly important, for staying compliant as well as demonstrating a commitment to sustainability.How do these topics translate to the technology industry? Anything specific Tietoevry is looking out for currently?As we are a B2B company, our customers are also our partners. We need to ensure we offer low-carbon solutions for our customers and support them in the transition towards circularity. One special highlight I want to make is our human rights work and filling the due diligence requirements. A current large initiative is developing an ambitious and comprehensive sustainability long-term plan for Tietoevry from 2024 onwards, to guide us towards a sustainable future as well as enabling more sustainable products, services and solutions for our customers and the society at large.The climate crisis, international conflicts, discrimination and hate speech have an impact on all of us, and enterprises are not immune to the situation. How are these topics visible in your daily work?When we crafted our long-term sustainability plan for 2020–2023, we examined our role as an organization and our potential contributions toward fostering a sustainable society. These insights were translated into concrete goals that reflect our commitments. However, our world has brought on significant changes since then.As we set our sights on Tietoevry's sustainability strategy for 2024 and beyond, we want to introduce fresh perspectives and adaptability to the ever-evolving societal landscape. It's imperative that we assess our priorities and determine the areas where we can make the most impact. For instance, the ongoing war in Ukraine has deeply affected us, given the number of colleagues who work in the region.Ida Bohman Steenberg. Picture: Evelina CarbornThe upcoming EU legislation, CSRD, EU taxonomy and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards will change the ways companies approach sustainability compliance. How do you see the legislation frameworks will mold the ways companies do business?For us, the focus has never been solely on compliance. Instead, we need to understand how we can actively address critical issues on sustainability. I thank the EU every day because local legislation is not on par in the markets we operate. For example, it is the EU currently driving environmental action.On a more practical level, we welcome the support provided by the legislation and other frameworks warmly. They not only enhance our ability to comply but also support us in bringing on people who may not traditionally have been involved in sustainability. Sustainability is for everyone to work with.Can you discuss some key sustainability initiatives Tietoevry has implemented on its sustainability journey?We are proud of several achievements. Notably, our commitment to the Science-Based Targets Initiative represents an important milestone of committing to joint environmental actions. Equally vital is the establishment of our human rights organization and the associated operational processes, which are crucial for our practical efforts in this area. Furthermore, we have forward-thinking initiatives at the intersection of ethics and technology, which we are we are eager to further develop. Finally, our dedication to supporting our customers and their teams in adopting more sustainable practices remains a top priority for us.Why is it important to engage employees and stakeholders in sustainability efforts? Can you share any best practices for fostering a sustainability culture?To reach goals and ambitions as an organization and practically as humankind we need everyone onboard. Sustainability is a collective action and we strive to make the diffent possibilities to impact accessible to all. Each employee at Tietoevry has the chance to incorporate sustainable practices, such as those of circularity, into their everyday tasks. It is crucial to foster a culture of transparency, to clearly articulate our objectives and offer training and insights to raise awareness. Engaging in discussions and joint projects with our customers presents the most significant potential for impact. By delivering more sustainable products and solutions, we can extend our influence far beyond our organization, positively affecting the broader community.How can technology and sustainability make an impact?In today's rapidly changing world, technology stands as the number one accelerator to achieve sustainability. Technology is embedded everywhere in all processes, communications, infrastructure and how we interact. Technology has a large role in facilitating global collaboration and knowledge sharing, which allows us to tackle sustainability challenges collectively.One wonderful aspect of sustainability is the opportunity to contribute positively to our world while also strengthening companies to meet the demands brought on by both regulatory bodies and society at large. This not only allows us to shape a better world but also positions us to thrive amidst a changing landscape.", Ida Bohman Steenberg ,Sustainability , 19.9.2023
Mentorship is a catalyst for uplifting diversity and inclusion,/en/blog/2023/09/mentorship-is-a-catalyst-for-uplifting-diversity-and-inclusion/,Meet our people / Ahmad Qureshi / 18.9.2023,"After living my early years in Pakistan, I spent the rest of my childhood in West Africa, where my father was a businessman. It was there that I was exposed to pure empathic human emotions and the challenges of the underprivileged.I returned to Pakistan and moved to Finland after becoming an electronics engineer. Having been exposed to diverse experiences ranging from the developing countries of Asia and Africa to the progressive and growing European nation of Finland, I understand the need to extend a helping hand, especially when these experiences have built me as a person.With my background, I was immediately drawn to the opportunity to make a meaningful impact when I first heard about the mentoring programme. As someone who has always believed in the power of mentorship and giving back to the community, I want to get involved.As a mentor, I was able to use my knowledge and skills to help refugee and immigrant entrepreneurs and professionals build their businesses or advance their careers, ultimately empowering them to thrive in their new environment.The importance of companies taking partTietoevry's participation in the Startup Refugees Mentoring Program demonstrates our commitment to giving back to society and our dedication to inclusion and diversity.

Introducing BLE Audio: unveiling the future of Wireless Audio,/en/blog/2023/08/introducing-ble-audio-unveiling-the-future-of-wireless-audio/,Data / Ladislav Podivin / 29.8.2023,"Why is BLE Audio capturing our attention? At Tietoevry, we proudly partner with major audio industry leaders, actively shaping the landscape of connected audio from chip to cloud. This technology has us truly intrigued. Now, let's delve into the fascinating realm of BLE Audio.Due to the recent explosion in numbers of sold wireless earbuds, I’m pretty sure that everyone is aware of these small useful devices. Most of these are based on Bluetooth Classic Audio. A standard that has been around for ages and is also well known from uses in our cars thanks to its handsfree functionality.The simplest explanation I can think of is, that BLE Audio is a next generation of this Bluetooth audio as we know it nowadays.Now the crucial question is, why do we even need a next generation? The current solution is ubiquitous and works quite well. So why spend time, effort, and at the end of the day our money, on something new?If you do internet research, it’s easy to conclude that the main benefits of this new technology are lower power consumption, lower latency and new features it brings. Personally, if I as a heavy user of Bluetooth classic earbuds, should pick the most appealing benefit, it would be the new features. Unlike Bluetooth classic, BLE Audio is not limited only to point to point connection. Getting rid of this dark legacy opens the door for new features such as True Wireless Stereo (TWS) or Auracast.Simply put, TWS means that we have two independent earbuds each receiving its own channel. But wait a minute, we do have TWS with the current standard, don’t we? Well, sort of. Due to the point-to-point nature of the “old Bluetooth” this must be achieved by vendor specific hacks. Usually, the earbuds also need to talk to each other and only one of them talks to the audio source. This approach is a bit clumsy as it requires one more transmitter in one of the headphones and might introduce other complications. Luckily, BLE Audio allows to both headphones to talk to the source directly.So, will this “True TWS” improve my user experience? Frankly, no, at least not directly. But I believe it clearly shows that the “old Bluetooth Audio” already hit its limits. At the same time, it’s a nice demonstration how much effort was invested into making BLE Audio as future proof as possible.The other new feature I mentioned is Auracast. Auracast is a fancy name for BLE Audio broadcast. In other words, transmitting audio from one source to multiple listening devices. The most straightforward use case that anyone can imagine is sharing a music stream from your phone with your friends, in a similar way that you can share an internet connection by turning your phone into a Wi-Fi hotspot. There are however more possibilities. My favourite scenario is a TV that allows you to connect multiple pairs of earbuds. So that a group of people can watch a movie without disturbing others not interested in watching.This short “BLE Audio in a nutshell” text has no ambition to be a complete guide to the new spec or to bring a comprehensive description of all the new features. However, hopefully I succeeded in conveying the message that BLE Audio is an interesting technology and not just some buzzword. Next time we will have a closer look at one of its aspects, so stay tuned.Read more:Software R&D as a ServiceConnected devices, software development, and engineering services for intelligent electronics", Ladislav Podivin ,Data , 29.8.2023
Leveraging AI for smart supply chain finance decisions,/en/blog/2023/08/leveraging-ai-for-smart-supply-chain-finance-decisions/,Digitalization / Kedar Shiralkar / 28.8.2023,"The financial disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of optimizing working capital for supply chain stability. Many companies have turned to supply chain finance (SCF) to effectively address these challenges. However, managing a diverse and large supplier base while assessing the financial risk of individual suppliers can be a daunting task. This study presents an innovative approach that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to segment suppliers based on their payment risk portfolios, enabling supply chain professionals to assess financial risk and strategize manageable SCF solutions for each supplier.Supplier Segmentation for Risk AssessmentTo streamline the SCF solution selection process, this study proposes an intelligent methodology based on supplier segmentation. By assessing suppliers' payment risk portfolios, supply chain practitioners can gain valuable insights into the financial health of each supplier. This approach uses a stochastic optimization model that calculates the optimal payment risk portfolios for suppliers.Generation of the supplier segmentation matrixUsing the results of the stochastic optimization model, the proposed method generates a supplier segmentation matrix. This matrix categorizes suppliers into different risk groups based on their financial profiles. Such segmentation enables supply chain practitioners to differentiate between suppliers with different levels of financial risk.Strategizing SCF solutionsArmed with the Supplier Segmentation Matrix, supply chain professionals can make more informed decisions about SCF solutions for individual suppliers. By understanding each supplier's financial risk, they can tailor appropriate SCF strategies to support suppliers in need and improve overall supply chain stability.Implementation of an AI-driven explainable recommendation systemTo operationalize the proposed methodology, an AI-driven explainable recommendation system can be developed. This system uses AI algorithms to analyze supplier data, identify financial risk patterns and provide transparent explanations for the recommended SCF strategies. Supply chain practitioners can use this system as a powerful tool to make intelligent strategic choices in SCF decision-making.Benefits of AI-driven intelligent supply chain financeNow that we've explored how AI-driven supplier segmentation can revolutionize supply chain finance, let's look at how your organization can benefit from this innovative approach. The benefits extend across industries, from retail to industrial solutions, enabling you to align and complement your existing solutions while adding real value to your operations.Examples of industry-specific benefits:Retail - Product Sourcing: Identify suppliers with optimal payment risk portfolios to ensure stable product supply. Improve your product sourcing strategy and minimize disruption.Manufacturing - Sub-component purchasing: Segment suppliers based on their financial health to optimize subcomponent sourcing. Maintain consistent production and minimize bottlenecks in the supply chain.Logistics - Freight Partners: Use AI-driven insights to select freight partners with the right financial stability. Ensure efficient transportation and distribution networks.Healthcare - Medical Supplies: Strategize SCF solutions for medical suppliers based on their risk profiles. Ensure availability of critical medical supplies.The AI approach complements existing solutionsThe beauty of this AI-driven approach lies in its ability to align with your current supply chain finance strategies. It doesn't disrupt your existing processes, but enhances them by providing accurate risk assessment and tailored solutions. By seamlessly integrating with your operations, you can achieve better risk management and more effective financial strategies.Our approach isn't just about adopting the latest technology. It's about transforming the way you make supply chain finance decisions. By harnessing AI, you can gain a deeper understanding of your suppliers' financial health, leading to smarter decisions that positively impact your supply chain stability and overall business performance.Let's assess your needs - we're here to helpAre you ready to embark on a journey of optimized supply chain finance?

How to make use of the implementation project in growing new talent,/en/blog/2023/08/how-to-make-use-of-the-implementation-project-in-growing-new-talent/,Digitalization / Teija  Elomaa / 27.8.2023,"At the beginning of the implementation project, there are always huge expectations on how the new system will save up HR resources for more strategic HR work. It might come as a surprise that HR Technology has become one of the strategically important areas which require dedicated resources. Though the leading Cloud HCM solutions such as Workday and SAP SuccessFactors deliver intelligent automation, support self-service, and empower your employees and managers, there are new tasks, knowledge and roles required after the implementation. How can the implementation project help you to tackle this challenge? The project gives your team a good insight into what type of work is required in the future as part of system development, business process optimization, testing, security analysis, organizational changes, integration and automation, reporting or implementing new functionalities - to name a few. It is necessary to think about how you want to resource this work going forward. HR functions at all companies are challenged to reskill their HR due to the new technology. To become more self-sufficient with your new Cloud HCM platform, involve your employees more. However, you can consider using more external resources in the customer roles.Picture the new ways of workingHR work changes along with the new HCM system, so it is essential to set your operations on a new track already during the implementation project. To make sure your HR team members know what is expected from them after the go-live, enable them to grow to their new day-to-day roles during the project. In many projects, people are pushed to their limits by combining daily work and project involvement. One way of measuring a successful project should also be the well-being of the implementation project team. It takes time and resources to commit to the new technology and adapt to the new way of working. To support this, you should reserve time for your team to be curious about the new technology and learn about it during the project. Testing stages provide early access to the system, which offers great learning opportunities. Testing aims to support you to become self-sufficient with the system. Your team should access the new system tenant early and often to increase their knowledge and gain confidence with the system.It is important to start building a bridge to the future at an early stage. Talk regularly to your implementation team members to be on track with their new career ambitions and find ways to create new opportunities for them. There are many customer roles needed in the project. Assign the deployment roles to employees who express interest in continuing with the system after the implementation. For example, Business Lead or Project Manager could be excellent in a hybrid role after the project with all the knowledge gained during the implementation. Technical or Test Lead could be a great extent to your HRIS team. Don´t forget the rising stars in these projects who adapt to the new technology faster than others. Be sensitive in spotting these talented professionals and offer them new opportunities. Some might be eager to take on new roles while some need encouragement. It is important to think about how you can engage your employees during the project and after it. You want to keep your key people motivated and engaged. All the knowledge they have gained in the implementation project is vital for “life in production”.Think hybridWith modern HR work, the meaning of hybrid roles is growing. You don´t necessarily need to be an expert in HR or technology but rather a tech-savvy HR. It is a great advantage to have someone in-house who can speak HR, technology and business – an interpreter between business and technical team; someone who is familiar with your company culture, HR management processes, the way teams operate and who understands the advantages and challenges of digital transformation for your company. The Cloud HCM implementation methodologies typically give many opportunities to involve employees. Think ahead who you want to involve in the project preparation, customer training, tenant sessions for design, configuration and data conversion, testing stages and user training. Pair your employees with consultants who are experts in their field. Don’t be afraid of the new system. Too often HR is underestimating their own skills. During my career, I have seen how the customers' project team's knowledge and skills have grown along with the project. Your HR can also learn to speak technology.Depending on the modules you choose to implement you might require new in-house roles in the future. It is important to think already when planning the project what strategic goals you have for modules you have chosen. The ownership of the HR processes and the modules should be clear already at the beginning of the project. Who owns for example the processes within Onboarding, Talent Management, Recruiting, HCM Core, Learning, Time Tracking, etc.? Do you need dedicated lead roles for those modules in the future? If so, then make sure that these roles are resourced already early on to ensure that future leaders can influence the design and decisions and participate in the testing stage to support configuration and business process optimization. To make sure that the system will be used to its full potential, your team should be dedicated to following the trends in their specific area. Depending on the number of different modules you might also need several HCM system administrators for support.How will you organize the day-to-day operations of the new system?It is good to keep in mind that the leading cloud systems such as Workday and SAP SuccessFactors are designed to be highly flexible and configurable. These solutions allow you to respond to rapidly changing business requirements without the help of IT. You can realign organizational structures, manage and configure your business processes, and share data with other systems by using the system´s toolset. Improving the user experience requires continuous optimization of new features, user guidance and training. The best Cloud HCM platforms are adaptable and constantly innovating. You as a customer will receive regular updates in your system that will require your attention. Make the best of these features to keep the system up to your business's speed and needs. The question is: will you monitor and work on the latest updates, new features and functionalities yourself? Or would you prefer to get release management support from an experienced partner?Be realistic about your company resources and get ready for life after go-liveStart the discussion of the post-production support early enough to recognize what is the best solution for you. Take into consideration your resources such as budget, timeline, knowledge and skill set of your employees. This helps you to allocate your employees during the project and identify the learning opportunities. Think of the level of self-sufficiency you want to achieve with the new system. What does it require to get there, and what is the realistic timeline for your organization?There can be a transition period considering your budget and resources. You should decide on how you want to fill in the competency gaps you have and find a good balance with your internal and partner´s resources to make sure that you are using your new HCM system to its full potential now and in the future.Whether you decide to be very self-sufficient or you need more support, at Tietoevry we have a dedicated team of HR technology experts who can help you.

It’s never been more important to be sure in your storage solutions.A domestic cloud ensures all data, including metadata, stays on sovereign soil and prevents foreign access regardless of circumstance. It should be part of a multi-cloud strategy, though it requires an understanding that not all data – nor cloud solution - is the same.

Everyone is asking the same question: How should AI be regulated?,/en/blog/2023/08/eu-data-act-how-should-ai-be-regulated/,Data / Wenche Karlstad / 21.8.2023,"What kind of requirements should be placed on AI-generated content? Will tighter restrictions slow down the rapid pace of innovation? Where is the line between legislation, guidance and ethical judgement?The EU regulation on artificial intelligence (the AI Act) was approved by the EU Parliament in mid-June. This means that within 1-2 years, the EU will have a law in place that will not only apply in EU countries, but will also set the standard for much of the world.- I believe that the AI law will spread much faster than the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). But they will coexist closely. Data protection will become even more central in the future.This is according to Wenche Karlstad, head of digital sovereignty initiatives at Tietoevry. She is one of those who have followed the process closely over time.Although there is still a round of negotiations with the European Commission and the Council of Ministers before the law is finalized, the draft says a lot about the future framework for the use of AI systems.- This is the world's first AI regulation, and anyone developing or introducing AI applications in Europe will have to comply with it,"" Karlstad points out.Professor Marija Slavkovik, head of the Department of Information and Media Science at the University of Bergen, also believes the AI Act will have a major impact.- Even though many people have objections, we need to regulate the use of artificial intelligence. What we are seeing now is the beginning of a new era of automation.Professor Marija Slavkovik from UiB.Big wins across industriesKarlstad believes that we are only beginning to see the outlines of what AI can do for us. She cites a few applications:Google recently held an event where they showed how AI will be able to detect cancer at an early stage.
AI can provide better healthcare, safer transport services and cheaper and more sustainable energy.
AI can provide more accurate weather forecasts, helping to protect buildings, infrastructure and crops.
Big benefits are on the horizon for industry and construction. We will see better use of industrial data, leading to optimized production, maintenance and material use.The list of areas where AI will impact everyday life and work is endless.- Ultimately, AI will be able to add value to society as a whole,"" says Karlstad.Double aim of the AI lawThe forthcoming EU regulation classifies AI applications according to their level of risk. The scale has four levels: unregulated, limited risk, high risk and unacceptable.- Real-time social monitoring, for example, will be completely banned. The high-risk category entails a number of requirements, including registration, risk assessment and labelling.""Anyone who is affected should prepare now for the upcoming legislation and what it means. Those who fail to do so may face sanctions,"" says Karlstad.She emphasizes that the EU regulation is not only aimed at restricting AI. It also aims to encourage innovation.- The EU wants to strengthen Europe's position in an area where the US and China dominate. In this respect, the AI law is a deliberate move by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.Wenche Karlstad believes that there is a need for internal guidelines that address both the ethical and legal aspects of AI.Establishing clear guidelines will create a more predictable environment.For the EU, the desire to strengthen Europe's digital sovereignty is at the heart of the matter. In a broader perspective, it is about technological and economic growth as well as about safeguarding citizens' fundamental rights and values.The boundary between law and ethicsCredibility is a key word when it comes to using AI. You need to know where the data is and how it is secured. But as a consumer, you should also - as NTNU researcher and author of ""Machines that think"" Inga Strümke points out - gain insight into how the technology works.What is ""real"" and what is AI-generated? What paths do data take in an increasingly intertwined value chain? When are our fundamental rights at risk?- It's equally exciting when we move beyond the realm of regulation to ethical principles.

Shashi Prabha Singh: A trailblazing technologist driving innovation and diversity,/en/blog/2023/08/career-page-shashi-prabha-singh/,Meet our people / Shashi  Prabha Singh / 18.8.2023,"She continuously seeks to expand her horizons, staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology. As she herself tells it:- I pursued a degree in data science and advanced business analysis from Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad. That was my passion - working on driving innovations in chip technology. However, due to limited opportunities, I joined a software organization, gaining hands-on experience in different technologies. Since then, my journey in the technological area has lasted for over two decades.Shashi continues:- First, I engaged in various hands-on activities such as requirement gathering, programming, and testing, marking the beginning of my learning journey. Gradually, I transitioned into a delivery management role and started leading teams. As I delved deeper into working with SMAC technologies, my interest in analytics and data science grew. Consequently, I pursued a degree in data science and advanced business analysis. While working in business process management, I realized that addressing customer needs requires considering not only the technologies but also the underlying business problems. To broaden my perspective, I completed a postgraduate course from MIT Sloan in Digital Strategy for New Age organizations and another course on digital marketing from Columbia Business School. This comprehensive approach provided me with a full playbook.Today, Shashi is a Vice President at Tietoevry Create, leading the digital innovation team dealing with different technologies, including augmented reality, extended reality, metaverse, conversational AI, and the Internet of Things. Her journey from a software developer position to a leadership role in a team dealing with modern technologies was shaped by comprehensive education and learning.Shashi sees diversity not just as a goal, but as a driving force behind innovation. She firmly believes that diverse perspectives and experiences are crucial in creating groundbreaking solutions. By bringing together individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and skill sets, Shashi's team can approach problems from multiple angles and uncover unique insights:- In my current role, I am immersed in the fascinating and challenging realm of diverse cutting-edge technologies, and I am continuously learning alongside my team. It is undoubtedly the best part of my current role, and I firmly believe in the value of a culture where everyone constantly learns, unlearns, and relearns. Another important lesson is that success is not solely dependent on individual efforts but also on effective teamwork and collaboration. The support and cooperation of both the team and the ecosystem play a vital role in achieving success.Shashi continues:- I am the first girl in my family to pursue engineering, despite facing resistance. I have set an example for others, and now there are more women in our community pursuing engineering. It is crucial to encourage girls to pursue education and provide support when they face decisions about marriage or a career in technology. Society plays a vital role in providing this support. Organizations like Tietoevry also make a difference by offering flexible work hours and part-time opportunities, allowing women to continue their professional journey alongside their family responsibilities, which are equally important.- I really want to see the change happening, especially in a country like India. I want to see women no longer perceive themselves as the weaker part of society. Being the first woman engineer in my community and family, I believe I have the privilege to go back and inspire many.Shashi is not just a visionary leader in the world of technology but also a catalyst for diversity and progress. We hope to see many following in her footsteps. It is by recognizing and appreciating the value of diversity that we can build a more equitable society and work life, where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and contribute.Join our team and reinvent the world.

Maryna Tirshu: A talented female leader making waves in the tech industry,/en/blog/2023/08/career-story-maryna-tirshu/,Meet our people / Maryna Tirshu / 18.8.2023,"As the Head of the Benelux Market and the Head of Strategy at Infopulse, Maryna is instrumental in driving the integration of the Infopulse family into the Create family. She has an impressive track record, having grown the communications platform company BICS from 0 to 14M in customers. Additionally, she established the Telco business from scratch, expanding it to a team of hundreds with a diverse customer portfolio. Maryna's exceptional skills were also evident in her role in building business continuity activities during the russian war in Ukraine.  We asked Maryna some questions to get to know her better. A lady of many hats, she is a fitting example of how we need diverse backgrounds in tech. Maryna is not an engineer; in fact, she has an academic background in Romano-Germanic Philology and Economics. But she became interested in tech within the company she joined after graduation.– We have a local saying that 'appetite comes when you eat,' and it was a bit of my story. I never intentionally decided to go into technology, but when I started, I couldn't stop anymore. Keeping in mind that I had zero experience in tech companies and zero work experience in general, I was quite motivated to learn fast. Probably, the fact that I was thrown right into such a high-tech environment with a quite wide degree of independence impacted my future way of thinking: 'Yes, you can’. Maryna says the best thing about her current role is her team; a diverse group of people who share values and spend a lot of time together even outside of work not because they must but because they want to.– Having such people around gives you comfort and absolute trust that you can achieve anything. I aim to demonstrate to our customers that we are the ones they can rely on for decades. It brings a lot of satisfaction and meaning to what I do. I am also so thrilled to collaborate with all Create colleagues in our super-international environment – Ukraine, Brazil, USA, Austria, Czechia, and Poland, I could continue endlessly, but... it is such a luxury to have no borders in collaboration,"" she says.Maryna doesn't think she has experienced many difficulties in her career not being part of the majority group in the tech industry, i.e., not being a man.– Not really, I was so focused on the fact that I don't have an engineering background, that being a woman was not my number one problem. Later, I realized that practical experience and healthy self-esteem are much more powerful than thinking about biases like 'one should have an education in engineering to work in tech' or 'men are more skilled than women in tech.' These are just limitations we set in our own heads, thus, the first thing to do is to get rid of them.""There is so much we can do to improve gender equality in tech, Maryna says and explains it further.– Before taking over the role of Benelux head, I led the Telecom business unit at Infopulse with around 350 people. And guess what? 52% of leadership roles in this business unit were held by women. I believe it was because of female role models around: it creates more comfort for women to grow in tech environments when they see real examples of women's leadership close to them.Women should not let the world around them impact their choices. Maryna thinks her biggest insight into life so far is that there is nothing more beautiful than authenticity.– My biggest life lesson is that it's totally fine to be yourself, exactly the way you are. From early childhood, we are told what we should and should not do by our parents, and then later by society. But it is important to stick to your own values and build the life you want – not the life someone else expects you to have. Never let anyone, including yourself, put your dreams down. If it is tech that interests you, jump onboard to the tech world and have fun!When asked about her biggest personal role model, Maryna says the war in Ukraine has forever changed the way she sees this.– Since February 2022 when the war started in my country, I do not have any specific role models anymore. Each day I see fantastic examples of human dignity, free spirit, and will of steel from ordinary people. People who are giving up their lives to make sure we all have our 'tomorrow.' All those people are my collective role model.Join our team and reinvent the world. For good.Visit our career site!", Maryna Tirshu ,Meet our people , 18.8.2023
Modern platforms empower new perspectives to manage enterprise financial performance,/en/blog/2023/08/modern-platforms-in-financial-performance-management/,Data / Jenna Mattjus / 17.8.2023,"We talked about the changes we have faced over the decades in terms of mindset, operating models, and financial management systems. Areas of enterprise performance management include consolidation, reporting, budgeting, analysis, and forecasting. As the organization grows and the requirements for performance management increase, processes become more complex. In such an environment, changing operating models requires a clear understanding of the big picture before implementing any changes in practices or tools.New technologies have brought alternative solutions for large and mid-sized organizations to manage financial performance. One approach has been to simplify complexity by consolidating the organization's needs, at least in terms of consolidation, budgeting, and forecasting, into one information system. There are new solutions on the market that support this path, and OneStream has challenged other vendors by introducing a cloud-based solution operating on a single platform. This way, data processing can be more effectively managed across the entire organization, and the same data can be utilized in multiple areas of performance management. The solution can also be customized to fit the specific operating model of each organization, without forgetting future needs, such as business expansion.Do you patch the holes one by one?Often, organizations invest in a new system that complements the shortcomings of an old system. In such an approach, the aim is to avoid making changes to the existing systems. With our team, we started to discuss about the emerging needs we have recently identified in enterprises’ financial management.Organizations have faced new demands in enterprise performance management, such as ESG reporting, data visualization, and forecasting. These demands arise both from the management and external stakeholders. As the needs have evolved, organizations have gradually expanded their system landscape, and at the same time made it complex and dependent on significant amount of work in various roles to maintain. This have resulted in unclear processes, inefficient distribution of responsibilities, numerous integrations between various information systems, and a large amount of manual work. In the worst case, the same tasks are done multiple times as it’s difficult to grasp the entire picture, and the same data is needed in multiple locations. To fulfil the emerging needs, organizations have done their best at that moment, temporarily patching the holes. However, the overall impact of changes on an enterprise scope may not have been fully recognized.Managing and keeping several systems technically up-to-date is laborious and costly in itself. And the more work is done with data from a larger organizational entity - subsidiaries and associated companies - the more complex and challenging the landscape becomes. It is crucial to consider each company's own systems and processes, which makes financial performance management significantly more complicated.Why are multiple systems acquired?In the discussion with my colleagues, we delved into the root cause of the issue. If the data required for managing financial performance is scattered, incorporating the necessary information across different companies, and within the enterprise, demands more from employees as well as the solution that is used. Additionally, if all information is not available in the required format from existing systems, it might lead to implementation of new systems to support, for example, evolving reporting and risk management needs.Our team has experienced that relevant and timely information needed for performance management is not always easily accessible in a complex landscape, and sometimes retrieving it from the systems can even be impossible. Enterprises hold incredibly large amounts of data, and the use of it continues to grow year after year, especially in the field of financial planning. This increases the performance requirements of the system landscape. When managing a business no longer focuses on interpreting the past but aims to quickly generate forecasts of future events, operational models need to be clarified to facilitate agile changes of direction. Obtaining information alone is not enough; it is also crucial to be able to make the necessary changes to leverage the information. This requires evaluating the efficiency of all financial performance processes and their different stages.Every additional component in processes and systems also increases the lead time of, for example, the completion of consolidated financial statements. Modern platforms, such as OneStream, empower organizations to seamlessly manage processes, data, and complex structures without hindering the productivity of professionals, addressing a common challenge faced in environments with multiple systems and tools. A solution that centralizes financial performance management onto a single platform can also bring value that may not have been recognized initially. At its simplest, it can eliminate almost entirely the time spent on separate Excels and data transfers.The challenge of information sharing extends beyond dataOur discussion on financial performance management veered into a challenge that greatly affects enterprises, and that we often face in our work: communication. It is impossible to grasp the overall picture of an organization’s performance if financial management processes are unclear or undocumented, or if schedules related to financial performance management are not communicated clearly. Challenges also arise when necessary information, such as changes in the corporate structure, is not adequately and promptly shared with all parties. It is important for an enterprise to have clear reporting practices and schedules that extend to all companies. Emphasis must also be given to the varying legislation, schedules, and practices internationally. Continuous dialogue within and between the companies plays a significant role, enabling timely reaction to changes and necessary measures to succeed.In the future, everyone will operate on the same platformWe want to contribute to easier and more efficient enterprise performance management. By managing and leveraging data on a single intelligent finance platform, Finnish organizations can simplify processes and reduce integrations. The resulting savings can be directed elsewhere in the core business of the organization.OneStream has found out in its customer research that organizations who have transitioned to a unified finance platform have succeeded to reduce the time spent on financial data management by an average of up to 80%.

Matter - from a specification to viable Smart Home products,/en/blog/2023/08/matter-standards-for-smart-homes/,Digitalization / Markku Tamski / 16.8.2023,"CSA's Matter standard for Smart Home interoperability has come a long way since our last update in June 2021. In this blog, we outline two tracks for product development: one about turning the Matter specification into reality in your products, and another about adding features and services that Matter does not cover. Both tracks are important for creating a competitive, Matter-compatible product. Our previous considerations for building a Matter product still apply, and we also highlight other plans and steps to take for creating a successful Matter product.Matter implementation can start by creating your own stack from zero or by taking the CSA Matter Open Source reference implementation as the starting point. The reference implementation is a major step towards a functional stack. It’s improving with community feedback, but it is a reference implementation that requires effort to adapt and improve, before it is ready to be used in products. First step is to understand the codebase, what it has and what it doesn’t, and the best way from our lessons learned is to create Matter device Proof-of-Concept (PoC).Matter PoC is one input to embedded device software product development plans. PoC’s can be used to evaluate hardware and development tool options available with hardware vendors’ development kits and identify focus areas for product hardware configurations. This will lessen the risks associated with hardware selection and development, and potentially speed up the product development execution.Once you have the PoC, you can compare it with your product requirements, identifying missing features, quality and performance issues, and start planning, how to create product quality Matter device software. Aiming for Matter testing and certification is one important source of requirements for that product creation, but this work does not stop with Matter. Testing and certifications across all the technologies used in the product are needed for extending interoperability also outside Matter.As noted, Matter specification evolves over time with expanding scope. Our next key topic is managing product configurations with ever-evolving Matter standard. Changes to specification scope and the reference implementation may create interoperability issues when the device is already out in the marketplace. As an example: Matter may provide only basic features to control a light fixture, but a vendor might want to add their own advanced product features to be competitive. Matter may define some of those same features in a later spec version, so being able to manage all the configurations of your products out in the field, as well as in future devices or software versions, is crucial.Upgrading your device, for example, to support newer Matter features leads us to the next topic: Matter device integration with cloud services. Matter specification defines the protocol for software update between devices, but it doesn’t define the needed Over-the-Air (OTA) software update cloud services or communication with those services. Software update is one example of a service that is critical for all connected devices to have, but not in scope for the Matter specification.We will look at these areas in more detail in our next blog, stay tuned.Our experienced software engineers and architects help smart home device manufacturers to develop and maintain software for smart home products. We are an active member of the Connectivity Standards Alliance contributing to the compatibility of smart home technologies among IoT products and ecosystems.", Markku Tamski ,Digitalization , 16.8.2023
Finnish industry looks towards data-driven green growth,/en/blog/2023/07/finnish-industry-looks-towards-data-driven-green-growth/,Sustainability / Jaakko Tapanainen / 16.8.2023,"The new government program states that Finland aims to be a pioneer in the clean-energy transition and carbon handprint reductions. The program contains many good elements to support the green transition. It takes a broad perspective on the Finnish business environment, proposing to increase domestic clean-energy production, raise research and development financing to 4% of GDP, promote digitalization, and strengthen expertise.However, the responsibility for realizing the benefits of these elements in new products and services for international markets rests with the Finnish companies themselves. The conditions for action are in place, but implementation now depends on collaboration between various stakeholders.Finland has the opportunity to be an international force for change by increasing our carbon handprint, thereby helping others to reduce their carbon footprint.Finnish belief in carbon neutrality goals waversIn May 2023, a survey commissioned by Tietoevry revealed that more than 60% of Finns have lost faith in Finland becoming carbon neutral by 2035. What are the possible drivers of this changed perspective? One reason could be the extensive public debate on the topic during the spring. This may have had the effect of making Finland’s carbon-neutrality goals appear too abstract and distant from Finnish citizens.Nevertheless, it’s encouraging to note that over half of the respondents in the survey believe that Finland can benefit from the industrial green transition. People see the potential to develop expertise (51%), create new jobs (37%), and improve the competitiveness of export industries (27%).During the 2023 SuomiAreena public debate, Markku Ollikainen from Finland’s Climate Panel discussed concrete steps towards the country’s net-negative emissions targets. He presented a simple plan for using Finland’s forests to capture industrial carbon dioxide and reduce emissions. New technologies for carbon sequestration would be key to achieving this vision.Keeping Finnish industry competing amid shifting market demandsCustomer demands and new legislation are raising the sustainability bar for Finnish companies. To remain competitive, it’s essential for our industries to be at the forefront of both the data economy and the green transition. These areas present Finland with an excellent opportunity to stand out amid international competition.Climate policy and biodiversity protection are progressing rapidly worldwide, leading to increased investments in these areas. The United States has allocated USD 400 billion in production and demand subsidies for the green transition, following similar moves by China and many European countries.Finland cannot compete with such figures, so it’s crucial for us to invest in future technologies and the development of the business environment in ways that encourage companies to focus on innovation. We have a good example and a challenger in our neighbor – the Luleå region of Sweden – where investment is flowing and skilled professionals are moving.A significant portion of the Finnish industry’s emissions come from supply chains. Yet many handprint solutions already exist to reduce customers' emissions and material usage. For example, by using data to optimize the operations of Tietoevry’s customers we can help them to reduce their own emissions, optimize equipment usage, and improve productivity. Utilizing data to streamline the entire value chain leads to cost savings and supports the green transition. Small steps have a significant impact.But we also need new solutions and close cooperation between different industries. A good example is the collaboration between the forest and textile industries, which has resulted in new material solutions like bio-based textiles.According to a study commissioned by EK (The Confederation of Finnish Industries), the emission reductions from Finland's green exports already exceed our national emissions.Positive effects stem from opening the entire value chainRegarding green energy use, Tietoevry has achieved its targets already. Our data centers in the Nordics now use 100% green energy and we are close to reaching a 100% recycling rate for equipment. We are also committed to Science-Based Targets (SBTis) for reducing emissions.Our most significant impact comes from how our customers utilize data and optimize their production. Emissions savings can be achieved through simple measures. Companies have long optimized specific areas, but a broader perspective has often been lacking.For example, nearly half of Konecranes' revenue comes from equipment maintenance, including the addition of new features. Modernizing equipment extends its lifecycle and may reduce the carbon footprint of any products it’s used for.Industry can also achieve immediate savings by reducing energy use or waste. For example, when data is more available and transparent, different companies can optimize retail deliveries by ensuring trucks transport full loads from warehouses to stores.The obligations imposed on companies are growing, but so too is companies’ interest in the transparency of their value chains and environmental impacts. The amount of data is also increasing, which poses challenges for transparency. The answer lies in technology such as sensors that allow us to operate in complex environments, as well as store data and exchange it between different actors quickly and smoothly.Let’s take another example from Konecranes. The company has 25,000 suppliers that it deals with directly. It also needs to monitor the subcontractors of these suppliers. This kind of comprehensive management is not possible without technology and data.The final question is about what engine of this change is: the environment, or the business? “Either or"" is no longer the way to approach this. Without the green transition, companies have no chance of survival.The idea behind good climate policy is that pursuing profits and emission reductions go hand in hand, and we have already succeeded well with this in Finland. Now is the time to look boldly to the future and continue collaborating with various stakeholders to promote the green transition!Interested in the topic? Watch the SuomiAreena discussion ""Reducing Emissions and Growing the Economy"" on MTV Katsomo (in Finnish)The SuomiAreena discussion included Markku Ollikainen from the Climate Panel, Juha Pankakoski from Konecranes, Ulla Heinonen from EK (Confederation of Finnish Industries), and Jaakko Tapanainen from Tietoevry.

Data as an Enabler part 3: Bringing clarity to data chaos with a data catalog,/en/blog/2023/08/clarity-to-chaos-with-data-catalog/,Data / Tomi Mustonen / 4.8.2023,"Say, you want to search for information about a new TV show that your friend recommended. You just type the name into the search engine (or generative AI solution), and you will instantly get more information and most likely the navigation to a service where you can watch the show.Now, imagine that you have started a job in a new company and want to find financial information or other important facts. You most likely search from the Intranet; some might try a specific IT system, and one tries to find a colleague whom to ask. When you manage to find the information, the next question you might have is how the figures are calculated and what they mean. This leads to another round of searching and consumes more of your valuable time.Respectively, data professionals face time-consuming tasks when they start creating new reports or other data products that utilize existing data from organization´s databases. Finding trustable data can be difficult and laborious as you need to find the correct data sources, get access to them, and often clean up the data to ensure that it is accurate, consistent, and fit for use.According to studies, data professionals still spend around 38% of their time in cleaning and curating data (Source 1). Although this number has decreased from 45% in 2020 (Source 2), there is a significant amount of time that data experts could utilize for more productive tasks. And this is only the professionals who use data, not the ones creating data in their daily work. Users of operational business systems don’t often know what data should be inputted in which system, in what format, and lack knowledge where their inputted data will be used. This can lead to careless data inputs. We have seen that data catalog is one of the key solutions to avoid this.What is a data catalog and what do we need it for?Key information that organizations have include:- Structured (tabular) data, usually stored in traditional databases, produced and mainly used in operational business systems.- Unstructured data, including documents, webpages, emails, social media content, mobile data, images, audio, and video.In addition, the following can be seen as key information assets: reports, data visualizations, and dashboards; machine learning models; integrations between systems and databases; external data sources, publicly available data, and data purchased from 3rd parties (Source 3).Why do we need a data catalog to gain control over these key information assets? One of the descriptions for data catalog is organized inventory of the relevant data in the organization (Sources 4 & 5). One analogy for data catalog is the card catalog used in libraries to register all bibliographic items into a central location. Each card in library catalog contains key information about one single book, such as author, style and unique identifier of the book. The card catalog, either web-based or physical, makes it is easier to search and find the book you are looking for.One should not try to include all data objects into the scope of data catalog. Instead, the organization should slice the data elephant and concentrate on the most relevant data. Relevant data can be defined as valuable piece of information that an organization uses to support and operate its day-to-day business, and information it uses to make decisions and forecasts.In short, data catalog collects metadata, “data about data”, meaning data stored in some form of IT solution that improves the business and technical understanding of data. The following figure illustrates key contents in a data catalog.Figure 1. Key contents in data catalogLet’s explain the key contents:Business glossary: Definitions of the relevant/important business terms, e.g., Product, Customer, Supplier. Terms that are used across the organization and are often represented with data.
Data dictionary: Technical descriptions of physical data storage solutions storing relevant data, e.g., databases. Documentation on tables, columns, data types, keys, etc.
Data ownership: Information about the owners and key stakeholders for specific data objects. Data owner has an accountability over a particular data object and cooperates closely with process owners who own processes using these data objects. Data stakeholders use, affect, or are affected by data objects.
Relationships: Relationships between business terms and physical data objects, e.g., database tables. Also, relationships between physical data objects. Can include relationships of the business processes and data objects.
Data lineage: Information regarding the origin of data and how it is transformed between systems and integrations.
Data locations: Information about where and how data is physically stored, e.g., in internal data center, cloud, server, file, database.To summarize, a data catalog:Creates single central repository which enables connecting different business functions and personnel.
Helps data professionals in collecting, organizing, and enriching metadata so that data is discoverable and governed.
Creates central documentation repository of company’s relevant data objects and therefore increases data searchability, access to, and understanding of data.A data catalog answers questions and concerns around data and gives a comprehensive view on the most important data objects for business operations.Figure 2. Data catalog answers questions and concerns about data.Business benefits of a data catalogWhy should one invest in implementing such a solution then?The key benefits of the data catalog can be summarized as follows:A data catalog enables employees working with data to save valuable time by helping the discovery of relevant data. This, in turn, increases productivity and efficiency.
By providing centralized location for all relevant data, data catalog enables collaboration among data stakeholders, including data owners, consumers, and stewards. Besides providing a common understanding of data definitions and standards, it leads to more informed decisions and increased confidence in outcomes. Collaboration can also foster new ideas and increase innovativeness.
A data catalog is an essential component in data governance, which sets policies and practices to ensure consistent data across the organization. Governed data leads to numerous benefits, including improved data quality characterized by reduced errors in data input and enhanced accuracy. Additionally, data governance fosters trust in the data, and thereby facilitates data-driven decision-making.Also, by providing centralized place for documentation, data catalog can decrease the lead time of data initiatives. Today, most of the development initiatives need, create and/or consume data and these initiatives will benefit of the documented and approved data landscape. When existing data, definitions, descriptions, owners are locations are known, it’s easier to evaluate the gap between the current and future state and the development required for initiatives.Once different data objects are documented and known, it is easier and faster to combine different data sets and implement integrations between systems. A data catalog also improves interoperability between organizations. When data is being shared outside the organization, whether sold or as open data, having well-defined definitions and proper documentation becomes crucial. Equally important is the understanding of data received from external sources.Finding a “fit for use” data catalogA data catalog is an important enabler for efficient data discovery and the trust in data. According to studies, the time spent to locate data and reports can be reduced by 50% or even more (Source 6 & 7).However, implementing a data catalog incurs costs, as it requires initial investment in its development and ongoing attention for maintenance. It is a technical solution used by humans and not a silver bullet fixing all data issues. Proper data management practices, as well as processes to curate the catalog itself, are needed.There are several mature and sophisticated data catalog solutions in the market, including an array of features but also potentially carrying a high price tag. Data executives should thoroughly assess the specific requirements of their organization. If the requirements are straightforward, then opting for a simple solution is recommended. The process of finding and utilizing accurate data to address critical business challenges should be as effortless as using your preferred e-commerce or search platform to discover and purchase a product. A data catalog is a valuable tool that can assist in achieving this objective.If you want to get your data in order and say goodbye to data chaos, do not hesitate to reach out.

How can artificial intelligence improve Finland’s healthcare system?,/en/blog/2023/07/how-can-artificial-intelligence-improve-finlands-healthcare-system/,Data / Ari Järvelä / 31.7.2023,"According to a study commissioned by Finland’s Sitra Innovation Fund, the country’s healthcare system can save hundreds of millions of euros each year by using data and artificial intelligence in the right way. At the same time, thousands of doctors and nurses would be able to concentrate more on the actual work of caring for patients.For example, artificial intelligence can make it easier for caregivers to search for and sort through information in the jungle of healthcare platforms and systems they use. AI can help to surface the right information at the right time, without caregivers needing to jump from one information system to another. This is useful in light of the nursing-staff shortages increasingly affecting Finland, as it enables caregivers to focus on patients rather than on admin work. It makes work more meaningful too.The use of artificial intelligence and data also enables us to shift the focus from specialized medical care to preventive healthcare. By analyzing large amounts of data, AI has been able to predict rare diseases long before symptoms cause damage. A doctor can quickly confirm a diagnosis made by artificial intelligence, and the patient can immediately begin to receive the right kind of preventive treatment.Managing masses of dataToday, we have huge amounts of data at our disposal. But what about the quality of that data? And how can we use it all as efficiently as possible?It’s a struggle to manage separate masses of information. Data from different sources may be in different formats, making cross-utilization a challenge. In fact, the smooth transfer of data between different systems is one of the biggest IT challenges in the healthcare sector. For example, one of Finland’s wellbeing services counties has 40 different systems in use. Many of these systems are incapable of communicating together, making data transfer from one welfare area to another a huge challenge. Transferring data between the private and public healthcare service providers is not easy either.At Tietoevry, we have been working together with our partners for a long time to enable the efficient utilization of data. One concrete example is our data-lake solution, which quickly brings together essential information from the different source systems used for healthcare and social-services. The data is presented in a visually clear way.We are constantly investing in enhancing our storage solutions and improving the mobility of data between different systems, so that we can use information even more efficiently in the future.The importance of supportive legislationLegislation and regulation play a huge role in enabling the introduction of new artificial-intelligence-based solutions. Legislation needs to support information security and patient-data protection, as these are critical enablers for utilizing artificial intelligence and data.Clear rules are needed for the use of artificial intelligence, so that we can all trust the security of new solutions. We must be able to prevent abuses and effectively deal with possible grievances. In Finland, there has always been a high level of trust in the healthcare system and the processing of sensitive data. This gives us a good foundation on which to continue building reliable solutions.It will be interesting to observe how legislation will approach the collection and utilization of sensitive personal data in research, development and innovation. These activities can provide broad benefits for the healthcare sector and help to solve the industry’s challenges, so supportive legislation is a must.A vision of healthcare in 2030​How then does Finland’s dream healthcare system look in 2030?Achieving our high ideals starts with enhancing the mobility of data to streamline the patient's treatment path. Data will also aid the development of more predictive healthcare based on genetic technology. Enhancing the use of artificial intelligence in administrative work will provide caregivers with more time to spend with patients.In my opinion, by utilizing artificial intelligence and data, Tietoevry and our partners can build healthcare solutions that better serve everyone. Making changes and utilizing new technologies requires courage, but I believe we’re ready to join forces and bring new innovations to the healthcare sector – both in Finland and elsewhere in the world.---This blog post was originally written in Finnish based on a panel discussion I took part in at Finland’s annual public debate, SuomiAreena.

"Going, going, gone? Why banks must move to modern card and retail payments systems asap",/en/blog/2023/07/migration-requires-strategic-choices/,Digitalization / Valdis Janovs / 13.7.2023,"Many existing bank card systems are simply not ready for the digital world and its associated challenges. Banks yet to realise this soon will do – as a result, all banks should now be preparing for the realities of a world focused on digital payments in which current levels of complexity will only increase.At Tietoevry, we commissioned a study into senior banking executive views of their card systems this year. This study found that more than half the card systems currently in use are between 10 and 20 years old and lack the flexibility to adapt to new digital-first product offerings. The survey also found four in five banks are having to employ more people than they did five years ago to patch up and maintain these systems. Banks know their systems are outdated, expensive to maintain and complex – and yet a lack of confidence in their internal capacity and concerns over operational interruptions and costs are preventing them from taking action.In our experience, banks that fail to prepare end up making forced decisions to migrate to more modern systems and processes. Planning for migration means more than releasing a “request for proposals”: senior executives need to clearly articulate a comprehensive strategic plan to their organization, as well as finding ways to improve working practices in the bank, and be present to manage the plan when it is underway.In our new study, we argue that banks should invest time and resources to align their IT requirements with the needs of their business, defining the scope of their migration internally to ensure they are able to replicate their existing functionality and add new features as part of the migration. The challenge banks face is to maintain current interfaces with customers while introducing scope for future growth and new capabilities.We find there is often significant dissonance between a bank’s senior management and its IT management. While IT management will look to vendors to help manage internal process re-evaluation, there can be a reluctance to actually change the business processes that go along with the changes in systems and software platforms. As payments and business go digital, such process changes will be required: banks that do the strategic work today and have the foresight to take action now will be the ones that will thrive and win tomorrow.Our new report, Options for Change: migrating to modern card payment systems, outlines different migration strategies banks can adopt and the pros and cons of each method, using case studies as examples. No matter which migration strategy banks choose, it’s clear that they should be working with experienced external partners who can guide and advise them at each stage of the process. As our report explains, banks should be migrating to modern card platforms without delay – or risk losing competitiveness and market share to more nimble, digital first competitors such as fintechs and neobanks.To learn more about the right card system migration strategy for your bank, download the new report here.", Valdis Janovs ,Digitalization , 13.7.2023
Do you want to be a fossil or trailblazer in the future of energy?,/en/blog/2023/07/do-you-want-to-be-a-fossil-or-trailblazer-in-the-future-of-energy/,Sustainability / Nina  Fowler / 10.7.2023,"It's clear that our present energy systems are archaic and inflexible. We need to change at lightning speed to ensure our energy systems can adapt and handle rapid changes such as the electrification of transport and industry, and the explosion in integration of unpredictable renewable energy technologies. However, we must ensure that energy remains a fundamental right rather than a luxury.Harnessing small assets creates a formidable forceOne way to achieve such flexible energy systems is to use what we've already got in smarter ways.The good news is that we already have what we need to achieve this revolution. There are countless energy assets that have not yet realized their potential in flexibility, many of which have historically been too small to be interesting for their owners or flexibility markets.A recent study* found that participation in flexibility initiatives could be improved through simpler participation processes, developing automation, and the presence of aggregators who can support potential flexibility service providers. Digital, automated systems such as Distributed Energy Solution, DES, tackle these obstacles that so far have prevented potential market participants from taking part.For example, heat pumps, electric vehicles, and other privately owned small energy storage assets can be aggregated into Virtual Power Plants and deployed as flexibility resources with little to no noticeable effort from or impact on their users. This can lead to reduced costs, finer control, increased grid stability, and improved resilience.A new link between distributor and consumerEnd customers’ expectations for digital services and their ease of use have only risen in the last years; clients expect effortlessness combined with custom-made solutions empowering their personal sustainability journeys.Automation allows consumers to become active participants in the energy market. Energy market actors have an unprecedented opportunity to create new revenue streams by developing consumer products that allow every household to become an active participant in the new flexible system.Tietoevry Nordic Energy Industry Study 2022 showed that for the Nordic energy industry, digitalization is a key focus, with 30% naming it as a key part of their work to adapt to forthcoming changes. Further, 89% of retailers and 76% of distribution system operators (DSOs) have a plan to promote customer participation in decarbonization and energy transition activities.New business models are already emerging to capitalize on these new opportunities, offering customers the ability to monitor their energy usage in real-time, adjust their energy consumption to optimize efficiency, and even sell their excess energy back to the grid. Companies that can offer innovative solutions, including solutions that use DES functionalities, which meet customers’ needs have the potential to be successful in this new market, pushing companies that fail to innovate to the sidelines.Inaction is not an optionDES makes energy market actors, from DSOs and retailers to energy asset owners and consumers, more active participants in energy constellations without being active. This paradox is explained by automation: you don’t need to log in and manage anything, just install DES, adjust any settings if you are aware of any particular user needs, and let it do its magic.The year is 2023, and we have an opportunity to make a real difference. We need to embrace change and seize the opportunity to create a new, better future. So, are you ready to be a trailblazer or would you rather remain a fossil? The choice is yours.

The EU’s DORA will enhance collaboration between financial institutions and their suppliers,/en/blog/2023/07/the-eus-dora-will-enhance-collaboration-between-financial-institutions-and-their-suppliers/,Data / Camilla  Bjercke / 7.7.2023,"The EU’s new Digital Operational Resilience Act, or DORA, comes into force in January 2025, aiming to help financial institutions (FIs) and their partners become more resilient to a range of cyber threats. We welcome DORA because it will help to streamline regulatory requirements across many information systems for all kinds of FI – from major banks to FinTechs – at a time when risks are growing, from violent conflict to economic instability.Some might see DORA as a hinderance to innovation, but that would be shortsighted. Instead, FIs should take a balanced, collaborative approach to implementing DORA that ensures the benefits of compliance outweigh the costs.Greater security, more responsibilityBefore DORA, financial institutions (FIs) managed operational risk by allocating capital – but were not responsible for all components of operational resilience. Once DORA is implemented, FIs and their partners will have to follow rules for protecting, containing and repairing their systems following cyber incidents – as well as detecting and managing risks, such as brute force attacks, fraud, phishing scams and more.“Under DORA, financial institutions and their partners will have to standardize and co-ordinate their risk management approaches.”The regulation applies to all FIs and their partners providing critical Information and Communication Technology (ICT) services. DORA will deliver enhanced cyber-security, better resilience and business continuity across the European financial ecosystem – and will be most effective when all players work together.The cost of compliance is growing, especially for small FinTechs – and that affects the cost of creating and delivering financial services. However, by applying the same standards to all players in the financial ecosystem, DORA will cut the chances of a data breach from one player causing a more widespread “domino effect”.“A balanced, collaborative approach will bring most benefit.""The smart approach to DORACompliance with such wide-ranging regulation doesn’t have to be complicated. To start with, most FIs already have some security measures included in their standard contracts. FIs should sit down with their partners to identify clear criteria for each area covered by DORA and a governance framework. Both the criteria and governance framework should be included in a fully transparent agreement that focuses on being as efficient as possible – which means straightforward processes that are easy to implement.There should be no need for FIs to find their own interpretation or develop a unique set of requirements from their partners – most mature ICT vendors should have their own approaches and FIs should be able to find synergies between their approach and those of their partners.“DORA will make ICT vendors more transparent and collaborative, which should lead to stronger and more productive relationships.”DORA is likely to make ICT vendors more transparent and collaborative with their FI partners, which should lead to stronger and more productive relationships. Banks and service providers outside the EU that have business inside the bloc will also have to comply, strengthening the resilience of the world’s entire financial ecosystem. Furthermore, because DORA streamlines and harmonises ICT regulation across the entire financial sector, the roles and responsibilities of all players are clearer. Risks are easier to identify and manage when it’s clear where responsibility lies.By bringing more structure and clearer guidelines, we expect DORA to improve business resilience and risk management processes across the financial sector. As a provider of always-on, fully-active banking and payments solutions that provide 100% system “up” time, we look forward to working with our current clients to deliver a more robust and secure financial ecosystem under DORA’s provisions.For a discussion about your firm’s approach to implementing DORA, get in touch with Camilla Bjercke.

Driving sustainability through technology: Lessons from Almedalen 2023,/en/blog/2023/07/driving-sustainability-through-technology-lessons-from-almedalen-2023/,Sustainability / Ida Bohman Steenberg / 6.7.2023,"To explore this critical issue, we visited the Swedish political week in Almedalen.For most Swedes this week is known as “Almedalsveckan”, a unique annual event held in Visby, on the island of Gotland, where politicians, businesses, non-profit organizations, and individuals come together for a week of democratic dialogue and networking. It's a forum where various sectors converge to discuss societal issues, including sustainability.As part of Tietoevry’s engagement in Almedalen, we hosted an exclusive roundtable discussion, where we united CIOs and sustainability managers from leading companies such as Skanska, Vattenfall, Telenor, Vinge, AFRY, Volvo Cars, Inrego, and Svenska Spel. We wanted to discuss how CIOs and Sustainability managers can join forces in driving its organizational sustainability agenda forward. An engaging dialogue led to three actionable insights that can guide different organizations on their journey to sustainable innovation.As businesses across sectors become increasingly digital, their role in promoting sustainability becomes ever more critical. Now more than ever, businesses must balance their drive for digital innovation with the potential environmental and societal impact. This new frontier of digital sustainability presents challenges, but also unique opportunities.Here are three key takeaways from our roundtable discussion:1. Embracing a unified visionSuccessful sustainability strategies demand a clear, collective vision. A unified vision simplifies the decision-making process and makes it easier for everyone to align their efforts. Volvo Cars' commitment to going fully electric by 2030, for example, offers a clear goal that resonates with every member of the organization.2. Establish a shared languageIn the intricate realms of sustainability and technology, complex terminologies often pose a barrier to effective communication. To overcome this, it's vital to establish a shared language that ensures clarity and minimizes misunderstandings. Clear communication not only enhances risk management and opportunity realization but also enables everyone to play an active role in sustainability initiatives.3. Define the ‘What’, then the ‘How’As change leaders, it's crucial to clearly define the 'what' to support your organization's progress on the journey towards sustainable digitization. 'What' is the particular challenge or opportunity to be addressed? It could revolve around reducing CO2 emissions from IT deliveries or aligning with your company's objective for carbon neutrality. It could also involve ensuring that technological tools and systems are inclusive, and that data is managed securely while being employed for the greater good.Once these objectives are crystal clear, it's time to tap into the collective expertise of your organization. Empower your team to devise the 'how' – the best strategies and methods to reach your goals. In doing so, you not only give your colleagues the guidance they need, but also the opportunity to innovate and contribute their unique insights to find the optimal path forward. The result? A dynamic, inclusive, and empowered approach to sustainable digitization.Our insights from Almedalen emphasize the vital role of technology in shaping a sustainable future. A unified vision, a shared language, and clear objectives can empower organizations to unlock technology's potential for sustainability. Together, we can navigate this digital transformation while ensuring a sustainable legacy for future generations.We wish to thank everyone that participated in this roundtable and are looking forward to continuing these vital discussions while encouraging more voices to join the conversation.Until next time,Ida Bohman Steenberg, Head of Sustainability, TietoevryUlrika Lagerqvist von Unge, Senior Sustainability Manager, Tietoevry", Ida Bohman Steenberg ,Sustainability , 6.7.2023
Unlocking the value of your data: A guide to successful API monetization,/en/blog/2023/07/successful-api-monetization/,Data / Faezeh Pourbarzegar / 4.7.2023,"Identifying yourself with a bank identification service, used for numerous websites and applications, provides a well-known example of how APIs are utilized. If an organization requires customer authentication to conduct an online operation, it can use banks’ electronic identity services to authenticate the customer. Using the personal information that it retains of its customers, the bank provides an authentication service, using APIs, to other companies. As there is a secure solution available, organizations are likely to use it, instead of building their own authentication product.Another concrete example of a business enabled by APIs is Vaisala Xweather, a business that sells hyperlocal weather and environmental data through APIs. Their solutions include weather forecasts displayed on car dashboards and lightning detection data for renewable energy plants to protect their assets.API monetization is defined as a concept that drives revenue by providing access to an API (Application Programming Interface) to third-party developers, customers, partners, or end-users. This happens mostly through public and partner APIs as they empower organizations to create new services and provide access to systems, data or functionality that have economic and strategic value to their business ecosystem.Figure 1. Value creation with APIsDifferent API revenue modelsThe figure above is a simplified illustration of how APIs can drive value. API owner provides access to valuable data or function to API customers (typically developers). The API acts as the tool that enables the API customer to transform the data from API owner into something of value. For instance, a developer may create an application that leverages the data to meet the needs of other users. This is what I call API product flow, represented in the top of figure as a purple arrow.API Monetization flow, demonstrated with green arrows, depicts the flow of payments from API customers to API owner for the consumption of API product. How the revenue is generated varies depending on the business model, the product or service being offered, and the target audience of the API. The revenue generation models can be classified into four primary categories: (1) free of charge, (2) payment by developers, (3) payment to developers, and (4) indirect.Below, I introduce the most common scenarios in the Payment by developers and Payment to developer models.Figure 2. API revenue generation modelsPayment by developersPay as you go. API customer pays according to usage. Typically billed periodically.
API owner provides different levels of resource access, with different rates.
Provides free usage until certain threshold, after which payment is required.
Unit based. Payment according to usage. Different APIs or features have different rates.
Transaction fee. Fixed fee or percentage of transaction is paid to the API owner.Payment to developersRevenue share. API owner shares a percentage of the revenue generated from transactions made in developer’s channel. Developer acts like a sales agent for API owner.
Partners share API owner’s content to drive traffic to the owner and are paid according to engagement, for example clicks.
Like affiliate but partners are paid only when the end user makes a purchase.In addition to these models generating direct revenue, An example of indirect revenue is that the APIs are free to use, but they increase the sales of the product, brand awareness and customer engagement. I will delve into indirect API monetization in later blog posts.Business benefits of API monetizationOrganizations can generate revenue through selling access to APIs or by charging for additional services built on top of the APIs. By opening their APIs to business partners, co-developers, or the public, organizations make their data assets available for use by API customers, enabling them to generate new value for end-users. As the number of API users grows, the API owner can develop additional revenue streams or increase existing ones. Sharing data can even trigger fundamental changes in the organization's business model.API monetization supports business ecosystems. Through API-based services, organizations strengthen connections with existing partners, establish new collaborations, and explore additional ways to engage customers. By connecting the ecosystem with business APIs (open APIs), organizations can take advantage of innovation opportunities of their own API products as well as those of their partners. A monetization strategy can help the ecosystem to maintain and expand its operations by attracting new developers who are motivated by the opportunity to earn revenue from their applications.APIs provide multiple opportunities to enrich customer experiences and build loyalty, for example through granting access to value-added services and premium features or providing accessible way to exchange information and extract value out of enterprise data.Are you ready to start monetizing your APIs?While the same approach will not work for two companies, there are certain fundamentals that every API monetization strategy will benefit from.Business plan: Research the market, review the business plan, and determine where APIs fit within the value chain or business . This involves investigating how APIs can create value and generate revenue, aligned with overall business goals.
API pathway strategy: Decide on the appropriate revenue and pricing model that aligns with the company's strategy and market segmentation. Finding the right balance between customer needs and business requirements is crucial.
Implementation: Launch the APIs and develop strategies to promote them to desired users. It's important to measure the success of the APIs from the outset, paying attention to developer experience.To summarize, there are two main prerequisites to successful API monetization: valuable data and maturity in API management. Valuable data in this context refers to something that can help improve the performance, user experience, or overall functionality of a product, service, or business ecosystem. In other words, something that creates unique value to its user. In the figure below, I categorize organizations into four zones, out of which three have the potential for API monetization.Figure 3. Four zones of API monetization readiness.In the first zone, organizations are advanced in API management capabilities and have valuable data assets that have potential to provide unique value users . These organizations have the capability to implement transaction-based and dynamic pricing models.The second zone comprises organizations that have achieved a high maturity of API management but don’t have enough valuable data or lack sufficient data management experience. In this zone, organizations can implement fixed-priced models and engage in mass selling.The organizations in the third zone are immature in API management and lack valuable data or are unaware if they pose data that could create value. These organizations are not advised to start API monetization yet. These organizations could review their capabilities to data collection, management and analysis, and initiate collaboration with other organizations to gain new insights and identify growth opportunities.The fourth zone encompasses organizations with valuable data but low API management maturity. By investing in API management, these organizations can move up to the first zone, where they can employ high-priced and unique models.How to climb the API management maturity ladder?What do I mean by API management maturity, then? Depending on the business targets and ambition set for API monetization, different capabilities are needed. The following figure illustrates the progression of API management across three stages.Figure 3. Three maturity levels of API managementAPI inception phase: In the first stage, APIs are designed and used to address individual internal business needs, often using private APIs. This stage emphasizes accessibility, connectivity, and information sharing.API development phase: The second stage is reached when APIs are used for automating and simplifying different business processes. APIs play the role of interconnectors, for example, between different departments in an organization.API optimization phase: The third stage is where the use of APIs extends beyond the organization’s boundaries to establish connections with partners. This enables the creation of a digital ecosystem and digital products, which in turn facilitates the monetization of data assets and the evolution of business model.Would you like to discuss about the opportunities in the API economy and the practices for monetizing your data assets?

When I left Tietoevry, I joined a Norwegian company that develops e-archive. I stayed there for four years. I liked the job, but I missed having more than 2-3 Swedish colleagues. Even though I tend to like working in smaller companies, that company’s Swedish department was a bit too small.Working in the Public 360° team feels like working in a smaller company, with the benefits and advantages that come with a company of Tietoevry’s size. I was lucky to be able to go back to my old job. It is of course interesting to learn new things, but having a good knowledge of the area is a big advantage and makes it easier to get up to speed.When I came back, I was surprised that so little had changed. Of course, there are a lot of new things in Public 360°, new colleagues, and so on, but still, a lot were very familiar.The thing I missed most was my colleagues, especially because I have worked with some of them before for about 10 years. They are also one of the things I value the most in my everyday work. It is also important that Tietoevry has stability but still is a flexible company.

Five ways cards and phones can work together to make payments better,/en/blog/2023/07/five-ways-cards-and-phones-can-work-together-to-make-payments-better/,Digitalization / Hans Sjölund / 3.7.2023,"Biometric securityBiometric security features like user fingerprints and iris scans are highly effective against fraud because they are unique to the user – as well as being easy to implement and operate. While they have been available on mobile devices for a decade, they are now becoming a feature on payment cards – and mobile phones can help users to activate and manage their biometric cards. Our new white paper explains how this process works – and why managing physical cards via an app like Tietoevry’s My Cards is the future of payments.In-store payments: phones as card terminalsIn May 2023, Tietoevry Banking launched Tap on Phone, an innovative solution designed to make payment acceptance faster, easier and cheaper for merchants of all sizes. Using Tap on Phone, merchants can accept payments from any contactless card or mobile wallet directly from their standard Android mobile phone. Payment acceptance no longer needs traditional card payment terminals, just software downloaded from an app store – and a card to tap with.Online authentication: fast and easy digital IDThe EU introduced Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) as part of its second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) to help fight fraud. Under SCA, all transactions over €50 must be authenticated using a secondary factor such as a passcode. While SCA is effective, it’s arguably introduced additional friction and slowed down transactions. Now Android phone users can tap their card on their phone to confirm their identity at online checkout. By providing convenient, fast authentications compliant with SCA, this collaboration between card and phone should boost to e-commerce growth.Card and mobile wallet as oneOur new white paper shows consumers don’t always prefer digital wallets over cards. January 2023 research firm JD Power claimed more Americans preferred paying by card compared to mobile wallets. In a recent survey for Payments Europe, 78% of consumers said[1] they wanted to be able to choose how they paid – while 48% of merchants in the same survey said they still saw cards as their main source of non-cash revenue out to 2026.Physical + virtual = phygital cards?Virtual cards may be the payments phenomenon of the 2020s. In 2021, the virtual card market was valued at $1.9 billion, and Juniper Research say[2] this could grow to around $6.8 billion by 2026. Virtual cards can be linked to a digital wallet – or a physical payment card. They are a popular alternative to corporate expense cards because they are sustainable, convenient and cheap to issue – though as with digital wallets, many users value the ability to link a virtual card to a physical card for convenience and choice at point of sale or online.Download our new white paper now for more on why and how mobile phones and cards are working together to deliver more services and greater security, speed and convenience in payments.[1] Payments Europe, November 2021, “The Evolution of the European Payments Market”: https://www.paymentseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Evolution-of-the-European-Payments-Market_Payments-Europe_Spread.pdf[2] Juniper Research, undated 2021, “The Virtual Cards Market”: https://www.juniperresearch.com/infographics/virtual-cards-statistics", Hans Sjölund ,Digitalization , 3.7.2023
Don’t believe the hype: cards still matter.,/en/blog/2023/06/dont-believe-the-hype-cards-still-matter/,Digitalization / Hans Sjölund / 30.6.2023,"In an earlier article I looked at how card numbers and spending on cards grew well above long-term trends across Europe last year – and why this happened. Simply put, consumers in North America and Europe prefer paying by card for the convenience, choice and simplicity – as we demonstrate in a new white paper. At the same time, multi-function cards featuring NFC contactless transactions have enhanced the utility and popularity of cards as a payment method, while new security features such as biometrics are making cards safer to use.As we point out in our study, “Card use keeps growing – the strategic implications"", there’s no doubt that account to account payments (A2A) and digital wallets, among others, are going to play a very significant role over the next decade. However, cards will continue to be key – and that has significant implications for bank strategy.What rising card use means for banksGiven that cards are not going away any time soon, banks should seek to reduce complexity in their approach to cards and introduce more resilient, efficient and modern card management systems. At Tietoevry, we are aware of many institutions still operating card platforms between five and twenty years old which struggle to integrate modern payment methods, from virtual cards through to Open Banking payments. Publicly available data supports this view, with PwC[1] estimating that banks and insurance companies now spend 75% of their IT budgets on patching up legacy systems – leaving little room to invest in innovation.By contrast, investment in modern technology stacks and digital-first products could speed up time to market, dramatically cut the time and cost banks spend on maintenance and improve customer service. There are examples across the value chain, from more sustainable card issuing practices (switching from paper to electronic communication, producing post-consumer plastic cards) through to fraud defences (modern AI systems that learn from fraud events) and acquiring and processing (omnichannel acquiring products able to handle everything from cards to crypto).Our white paper also explains how banks can address their current profitability crisis by making smart investments in modern card systems that reduce long-term operating costs, improve the profitability of their payment operations and enhance customer satisfaction. Furthermore, having modern card systems will mean banks can automate more and devote more resources to innovating for the benefit of their customers – and their shareholders.For more on how your bank should respond to the continued popularity of cards, download the new white paper from Tietoevry Banking now.[1] See Techsense, 2 May 2022, “What are the hidden costs of legacy systems?”: https://techsense.lu/news/hidden-costs-legacy-systems-pwc", Hans Sjölund ,Digitalization , 30.6.2023

Best practices to house your Learning Catalog in Workday,/en/blog/2023/06/best-practices-to-house-your-learning-catalog-in-workday/,Digitalization / Minji  S. R / 30.6.2023,"Get started with inactive courses and learning historyA significant part of the changing LMS relies on loading learning history. Alongside that journey, you can also determine how to migrate a portion of the catalog.Step 1: Assess the necessity of bringing the learning history data to the new platform. Think about storing some data elsewhere and load only what is needed for immediate reporting. Consider bringing over only data from the past 5 years, evaluating compliance and user requirements to determine the appropriate timeframe.Step 2: Determine if learning history is required for all learner types, including employees, contingent workers, terminated workers, and active/inactive Extended Enterprise Learners. Workday Learning for Extended Enterprise allows you to let learners who are not your workers use the LMS.Now that you have a subset of learning history designated for conversion to your new platform, our next step is to analyze this history and determine the status and types of courses within it.Step 3: Typically, a list of courses is extracted from the learning history report(s) to determine their status: active (in use or will be used) or inactive (obsolete). Inactive courses can be migrated as imported content in Workday, which cannot be edited or searched unless they serve a purpose to the organization's learning strategy.Active courses will be migrated irrespective of their footprint in learning history. Let’s understand how.Tackling your active coursesYour active Learning Catalog may be a mix of courses with digital content (media files like video, documents, images etc. and packaged content) and instructor-led courses. Workday houses courses with one or more instructor-led components, including webinars, as ‘blended courses’. Courses with only media content can be housed as ‘digital courses’. Leveraging user-generated content in your organization's learning strategy is fulfilled by standalone lessons in Workday.Courses in your catalog can be further categorized based on ownership into the following types: owned content, licensed content and third-party platform. For your subscription-based learning content accessed by learners through third-party platforms like LinkedIn Learning, Coursera etc. Workday offers Cloud Connect for Learning and Public Learning Content (for YouTube) subscription-based products with pre-built integrations to supported content providers.At last, review the list of active courses and make sure to drop courses which are no longer relevant to your learners. For the finalized list of courses, proceed to transfer to Workday. These courses may contain media files which require a separate strategy. More on that below.Media migrationThe discussion on error-free Learning Catalog migration is incomplete without the detailing on ways to manage media. In Workday, Media Cloud allows you to import media files and packaged content into Workday to link it to a course. There are usually thousands of courses and their media files in the picture, that need to be set up in Workday - it is advised to also explore Media Importer and Workday Drive for easy transfer and centralized storage of media files to ease this.Final touch: Bundling and access controlYou can create a curriculum for your learners by bundling multiple courses and standalone lessons into a Program. Workday can track the completion of constituting content as well as the overall program.With Workday’s security provisions, you can control target learner group access by topics you have associated your learning content with as well as other criteria such as organization, worker type etc.These key considerations on Workday functionalities will assist you in navigating the process of shifting your Learning Catalog to Workday and facilitate your journey towards a successful cloud LMS adoption.Are you interested in getting my support with Workday Learning?

Werneri Tuompo: There’s more than one way into the IT industry.,/en/blog/2023/06/career-story-werneri-tuompo/,Meet our people / Werneri Tuompo / 29.6.2023,"In his role as a project manager Werneri works with a talented team building data-driven innovations on top of the unit’s flagship product: Data platform for health.- I used to be on the receiving end of this data, using it in research in the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare knowledge management. Now I’ve moved closer to the start of the pipeline. What we do is gather and process vast amounts of data and make it accessible for different user cases, anything from research to knowledge management, AI development etc.One of the users is the Hospital District of Helsinki.- What we do helps the wellbeing of the whole nation, which adds great meaning to this job.Werneri’s responsibilities include keeping the project on schedule and being the point of contact for customers. That’s where his background is very helpful.Bad handwriting meets 1s and 0sThere’s an old joke saying doctors have incomprehensible handwriting, while IT people say that there are 10 types of people in this world, those who understand binary code and those who don’t. Part of Werneri’s job is to get these two groups to understand each other.- My background is very useful in the sense that I can understand what medical staff need and with my ever-increasing knowledge of technology, I can help them understand how technology and infrastructure can solve many of the challenges they are facing. The rapid development in data usage in the healthcare industry has made customers unsure about what technologies to adapt and how to use them. Tietoevry’s extensive experience and wide portfolio of products from the sector have made them a reliable partner.A steep learning curveWerneri has had a steep learning curve the first 18 months at Tietoevry, both when it comes to technology and ways of working.- Getting my head around cloud-based technology like Microsoft Azure and how IT architects work has been a challenge, but my job isn’t being an IT expert. It’s more about understanding what my colleagues do, not being IT savvy myself. The biggest change has been how the team works.- Everything is done in sprints, Werneri says with a humorous tone. There are sprints and scrum meetings, and that is far from how I used to work. But there’s no doubt that this method is much better, and you get feedback on the project status much quicker with short sprints. It was a big change, but I like it. Another aspect of the team Werneri cherishes is that it’s quick and nimble.- There are several advantages to working for a big company like Tietoevry, and we combine that with the benefit of working in a small team. There’s no hierarchy and we make decisions very quickly. The other day a colleague said he was interested in being a scrum master, and we appointed him to the role immediately. A small team where everyone knows one another well has an added advantage.- When we all know and trust each other, we remove the fear of failure. To me, that’s the key to successful development. It bodes well for both the future of Tietoevry, and the Finnish health care sector.Join our team and reinvent the world. For good.Visit our career site!", Werneri Tuompo ,Meet our people , 29.6.2023
How Digital Commerce Serves as an Icebreaker for Digital Transformation at Industrial Companies,/en/blog/2023/02/digital-commerce-an-icebreaker/,Data / Jonas Prosell / 26.6.2023,"You might wonder how. Well, to facilitate the buyer's journey and the functionality required for digital commerce, the webshop and self-service features need to receive the right information from underlying systems, and transactions need to be executed according to customer expectations. Everything needs to happen consistently and in a timely manner.This often leads to a chain reaction where our clients must work on breaking down silos, consolidating master data in one place and making it accessible, conducting a thorough analysis of all related processes, and ensuring system support to create the desired customer experience. As a result, our clients become equipped to embrace the ongoing commitment to continuous improvement.Technology becomes an enabler rather than a driving force. New technology is good, but only if the selling company has the capacity and maturity to use it.There isn't a single platform that we recommend for all companies. Nor is there a universal solution. Our experience with various systems, clients, and industries shows that good solutions can be built in several different ways.Several different content management systems (CMS) can fit the customer depending on their budget, organization, business, and maturity. The same applies to the e-commerce platform.For some companies, a product information management system (PIM) is crucial to increase productivity and maintain product information across multiple sales channels. For others, managing digital assets in a Digital Asset Management System (DAM) is a central component.Additionally, there is a multitude of different applications for content creation, marketing, personalization, analysis, product recommendations, AR, VR, and more, which can have a valid place in the application landscape. In terms of the industry, technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT) to control and send information from machines can also be useful in a customer portal. We also see that educational platforms and VR and AR technology can be highly beneficial for guiding and educating customers within the scope of a customer portal.So, how do you best build a future-proof and scalable architecture?There are platforms that offer a wide range of functionality and tight integration. Choosing such a platform can be an efficient way to build the entire customer journey and the customer portal. We recommend our clients to analyze what suits them best based on their specific situation.
Another approach is to assemble different applications in a ""best of breed"" solution. It is important that the components are built ""API-first,"" meaning that it's easy to communicate information between them. The interfaces used by the customer on PCs, mobile devices, or other devices are usually built independently of the underlying systems.
In an ""ultra-agile"" solution, the solution is often built from scratch and specifically tailored to the customer. This approach suits advanced companies with very high demands.Irrespective of the chosen path, the customer needs to consider that the solution should allow for growth and the addition of new features to improve the customer journey over time. Regardless of the platform and technology choice for the customer portal itself, orchestrating the customer journey and managing customer relationships will require focused efforts to transform the business and processes. This often frees up resources and contributes to building a better company!I hope this blog series has been educational and provided you with insights and inspiration for your digital journey.

Nobody knows you're a dog - 30 years later,/en/blog/2023/07/nobody-knows-youre-a-dog-30-years-later/,Digitalization / John Erik Setsaas / 26.6.2023,"We were not doing a lot online back then, mainly Compuserve, Gopher and Usenet, which we accessed through a dial-up 28.8kbps modem. Phishing frauds existed, the consequences were not really that big, although the first internet banks started to appear a year or two later.Needless to say, with the Internet population growing from 14 million to 5 billion in the past 30 years, and people doing a lot of critical transactions online, the fraudsters have also found multiple ways to abuse the online space. Hence, the problem of ""being a dog"" (or perhaps: ""what kind of dog are you""?) online has gotten a lot much worse.If you have ever seen me presenting, you know that I love this cartoon by Peter Steiner that was published in the New Yorker on 5th July 1993:We still don't have any good way of proving who we are or something about us online. Last year, I joined an online forum about digital identity and introduced myself by name and company. The first comment I received was ""Prove it""... And of course, I do not have a simple way to do this. And if somebody calls me and claims the call from the bank or the police (or ""Microsoft support""), I don't have a simple way of verifying that they actually are who they say they are.Verifiable Claims and EU digital identity walletEven though there are a lot of details around the EU digital identity wallet (EUDIW) which are not clear at this time, I believe that we are moving in the right direction. We are moving towards an eco-system, where I will be able to present claims about myself, which can be verified by others; Verifiable Claims (VCs). With VCs, I would be able to prove that I am a human (bye, bye captchas), who I work for, my nationality, my age, my credit score, and pretty much anything else, for example proving that you are eligible for discount on public transportation (without having to reveal whether this is because you are of age, or have a medical condition). Only the imagination limits the use cases when we have the EUDIW infrastructure in place.CertificationHowever... When I receive a claim, how do I know whether I can trust it or not? By using asymmetric cryptography, the origin, integrity and non-repudiation of the claim can be asserted, or in other words, the claim is exactly as it was issued by the issuer. Some would also claim that distributed ledgers (aka blockchain) is the answer to this.A more challenging question is: who is the issuer of the claim, and can I trust them? This requires a trust infrastructure, and we already have this when certification authorities (Cas) are issuing digital certificates. If you want to set up a public webpage, you will need a digital certificate, which is issued by a trusted issuer. These issuers have gone through an official approval process, to ensure that certificates are issued in a trusted way. This includes checking the identity and doing background check.Whenever you visit a website, your browser will check that the URL matches that of the corresponding certificate, making it very difficult for somebody to spoof the website. The same trust infrastructure can (and will) be used to issue VCs. And the same infrastructure will be used to handle revocation. A claim like ""I am allowed to drive a car"", may be revoked by the authorities, if for example you have been drunk driving.But how do you know whether you can trust the issuer of the information. If a website has a valid certificate, it does not automatically mean that you can trust the information posted on that website. We've all seen a lot of websites with false information, but a valid certificate. So, a Certificate Authority will only assert the identity of the organization or person behind the website, not the credibility.To conclude, we have not solved the ""Nobody knows you're a dog"" conundrum 30 years later. But despite the challenges mentioned above, we are definitely moving in the right direction. Personally believe the EUDIW, and similar initiatives around in the world will help solve the issue.So perhaps, a few years from now, everybody will know you're actually a dog.", John Erik Setsaas ,Digitalization , 26.6.2023

Google’s updates in GenAI – key takeaways from Future of GenAI event in Finland,/en/blog/2023/06/googles-updates-in-genai-key-takeaways-from-future-of-genai-event-in-finland/,Cloud / Hanne  Haapoja / 22.6.2023,"The Gen AI challenges, requirements for clear use cases and importance of responsibility and security were the key take aways in the event. As both CEO, Co-Founder Peter Sarlin from Silo AI and Founder, R&D Antero Hanhirova from Happeo opened a wide range of Gen AI related business benefits, which become realized when understanding how to command GenAI, prototyping different approaches and having a clear problem statement.Google’s next generation Large Language Model PaLM2 and how that’s going to change how we work and do businessGoogle EMEA’s Generative AI Ambassador Ted Schönbeck’s keynote speech was eye opening when presenting Google’s responsible AI. PaLM2 is Google’s approach in building and deploying AI responsibly. It’s Google’s next generation large language model which is trained with much more data than its predecessor and has higher performance. You can also check out an explainer video if you are not familiar with the topic.The new conversational AI platform BARD which is designed for everyone, is able to handle a massive dataset of text and code. It is not limited to a closed set of responses, so it’s quite accurate when processing the information from the real world in real time. Addition to code and scripts BARD is able to generate also, email, letters, etc. It can be used for a variety of purposes, from creative writing to technical documen­­tation and even to creating music, images, and videos.Schönbeck was strongly emphasizing the importance of following EU’s data protection requirements what comes to the launch of BARD in Europe, platform needs to meet the compliance requirements before the launch. So, in addition to the existing 180 countries with three languages, BARD will be opened also in EU this year - and even in Finnish!BARD is still under development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers. It is a powerful new tool that can be used for a variety of purposes, and it is sure to have a major impact on the way we live and work for instance customer service, education, research, and creativity.For the enterprise usage Google has launched Enterprise Generative AI. This platform is integrated end-to-end enterprise platform for business users, developers, and AI experts. The Enterprise Generative AI enables open and shared innovation in a secured way. Google Cloud Tenants are able to utilize the Model Garden library of more than 80 LLM’s, butData is always encrypted,
Google processes input only to generate the output,
data & parameters are not stored, and
all created innovation models and solutions stay inside the Cloud Tenant.Google is aiming to generate 80% faster and 50% cheaper model training and tuning with The Enterprise Generative AI Platform’s performance, scale, and efficiency capabilities.Utilizing GenAI comes also with AI responsibilityGoogle’s Technical Director Lara Suzuki gave an inspirational speech on AI responsibility. She considers that trusting AI systems is the biggest barrier for enterprises moving from the lab to production. Lara Suzuki keeps the ethics at the center of everything and considers only responsible AI being successful AI. She reminds that responsible AI is not only about the tooling (data exploration and visualization, model analysis and explainability methods and model reporting), it’s also very much about the corporations’ internal processes (governance such as approval processes, education, and AI development framework).Suzuki’s guidance for all of us concerning responsible AI is very assuring – everyone has the same challenges: there is no one-size-fits-all approach, but definitions and standards are evolving and AI specific regulation is coming. Technologies as well as harms and risks are constantly changing. It’s also good to remember that national and cultural differences matter and in addition often culture change is required among sociotechnical approach.Suzuki’s key steps to responsible AI are:Assess risk: define the use case, assessing impact, model limitations
Consider adjustments: design and fine tuning, user safeguards, regulatory preparation
Perform safety testing: safety attributes & thresholdings, adversials testing, testing datasets
Model in production: model monitoring, user feedback, model cards, using RAI toolingSAP and Google cooperation as a use case for the enterprise level organizationsGoogle’s SAP and Cortex Specialist Barrett Conway opened in his presentation the benefits of SAP and Google Cloud partnership launched this year. Customers are able to build an end-to-end data cloud that brings data from across the enterprise landscape utilizing SAP Datasphere and Google’s Data Cloud to view their entire data estates in real time and maximize value from their Google Cloud and SAP investments.According to Barrett Conway data is the cornerstone of digital transformation and AI development, but organizations are struggling to get the value out of the data:97% are investing in data initiatives
91% have increased investments in data and AI
74% appointed have chief data or analytics officers,
but only 20% see their models go into production.When combining SAP software data and non-SAP data on Google Cloud from any data source, organizations are able to run digital transformation with the full data foundation to utilize their full business potential: e.g. simplify integration complexity with SAP, reduce time, effort and cost to deliver analytics and insights and expertly assist with decision making and tasks.SAP systems together with Google’s data cloud introduces entirely new opportunities for enterprises to derive more value from their full data footprints and unified data foundation and advanced AI tools and large language models to find new insights from their data. But it also addresses key sustainability challenges, Barrett Conway highlights.SAP is able to unlock sustainability data in business processes while Google Cloud can unleash the power of sustainability data. The combination creates a Sustainability Data Framework which provides actionable insights to support corporate sustainability targets to prevent e.g. climate risks.Google Cloud is a strategic partner for Tietoevry Tech Services and improving efficiency, sustainability, and innovation with us. We appreciate Google’s approach to Responsible AI, and we are eager to co-innovate with their advanced skills in generative AI which enables our customer’s success.", Hanne  Haapoja ,Cloud , 22.6.2023

Companies and public bodies are looking to increasingly put their data in good use with the help of innovative technologies. In the meanwhile, the growing legal maze governing the use of data, cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) is often cited as a key obstacle for organisations looking to deploy innovative technologies. With new major EU regulatory initiatives under preparation, it is now more important than ever for organisations to proactively analyse and consider the impact of upcoming legislation in their data, cloud and AI strategies.

How to not build resilient systems?,/en/blog/2023/06/resilient-systems/,Data / Charu Upadhyay / 19.6.2023,"Survivorship BiasDuring World War II, researchers at the Center for Naval Analyses conducted a study to assess the damage done to returned aircraft after missions. The initial inclination was to add armor to the areas that showed the most damage as those were perceived as the most vulnerable parts. However, Abraham Wald, a mathematician, observed that the study was only conducted on the aircraft that had withstand the attacks (represented by the red dots in the figure) and still return safely. However, the areas that remained unscathed such as the cockpit and engine, were overlooked, potentially obscuring a different narrative. These unaffected are those areas that if hit, would case the plane to crash and be lost.Image: WikipediaThis brings us to a critical point: what assumptions do we make regarding the resilience and recovery capabilities of our systems, and are they well-justified?False assumptions can undermine our recovery capabilities. If the aircraft were reinforced in the most hit areas, this would be a result of survivorship bias because crucial data from fatally damaged planes was missing while making assessment. Consequently, we run the risk of overlooking significant factors and failing to cover the ‘unknowns’ that may impact our operations.When was the last time your organization experienced an outage, and did it have a substantial impact?The answer to this question cannot be simplified to a simple yes or no. In the current dynamic business environment, where any amount of downtime is unacceptable, even a brief interruption can result in billions of dollars in losses. The repercussions of such downtime extend beyond financial implications and encompass reduced productivity, damage to reputation, low customer confidence, mental stress and more.Regardless of whether your operations are on-premises or in the cloud, system outages are an inevitable reality. They can arise from several factors, including hardware, software, human error, system malfunctions, natural disasters, and others. This issue is not new; we have encountered it repeatedly in the past and will encounter it in the future as well. Failures occur all the time, and while complete eradication may be unattainable, we must acknowledge and embrace them to enhance our preparedness.According to Uptime’s 2022 Data Center Resiliency SurveyNetworking issues are causing a large portion of ITNetworking-related problems have been the single biggest cause of all IT service downtime incidents – regardless of severity – over the past three years. Outages attributed to software, network and systems issues are on the rise due to complexities from the increasing use of cloud technologies, software-defined architectures and hybrid, distributed architectures.The overwhelming majority of human error-related outages involve ignored or inadequate procedures.Nearly 40% of organizations have suffered a major outage caused by human error over the past three years. Of these incidents, 85% stem from staff failing to follow procedures or from flaws in the processes and procedures themselves.Resilience is often underestimated, but its significance cannot be emphasized enough. We all have experts who have helped us build a stable and functioning system following the best practices, but no architecture is fail safe.We may have ensured high availability, replication, geographic redundancy, backup strategies, BCDR strategy etc., but are we still truly confident in their resilience? Merely assuming everything is taken care of can be a risky mindset.Before we dive in, let us make sure we understand some terms very clearly:Reliability and ResiliencyThe Oxford Dictionary definition of reliability is ""the quality of being trustworthy or of performing consistently well,"" whereas resilience is ""the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties.""In the world of cloud computing, reliability means that the services should run as they are intended to run at any given point in time, whereas the resilience of the service means being able to withstand certain types of failure and yet remain functional from the customer's perspective. In other words, reliability is the result we strive, and resiliency is the way to achieve it.Business continuity and disaster recovery plan (BCDR)It is a set of strategies, policies, and procedures that help an organization respond, adapt, continue its essential operations, and recover in the event of a disruptive event. While BC (Business Continuity) deals with the business processes and functions, DR (Disaster Recovery) is primarily focused on the recovery from the IT side.Recovery Point Objective (RPO)It refers to the point in time in the past to which you will recover.Recovery Time Objective (RTO)It refers to the point in time in the future at which you will be up and running again.Let us understand this with an analogy:There is a baker who bakes pies that takes 2 hours, using an oven that runs continuously. One day, the oven breaks while baking, and the pies get ruined. To get back to baking, the baker has another oven available, but it needs a 1-hour preheat time.RPO is 2 hours because the damaged set of pies represents a loss that the business must accept.RTO is 1 hour, which is the time it takes to resume baking after preheating the second oven.Backup strategiesA backup strategy is essential for data protection, maintaining business continuity, compliance and legal requirement, disaster recovery, and overall peace of mind. Many solutions exist for backing up data, including hardware-based, software-based, and cloud-based methods. Cloud providers offer different backup plans with strategies like incremental, full, automated, hybrid, and multi-cloud backups. Assessing your needs helps you choose the right backup strategy for you.Chaos engineeringIt is the discipline of experimenting with a system in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production. A harsh way to ensure that your failure recovery is working correctly is to intentionally crash your production servers.There are many tools available on the market to assist with resilience testing like Netflix famous chaos monkey, AWS FIS (fault injection simulator), Azure Chaos studio and many others.Ask yourself following questions:Do we have a well-defined business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) plan in place? If so, are we implementing it effectively?
How frequently do we test the resiliency of our application?
Do we share the results and learnings from testing with different teams?
Are our recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) realistic enough and aligned with the business needs?
Do we have reliable runbooks that are regularly updated? Can we trust these runbooks during critical failures?
Have we ever rehearsed these runbooks and playbooks?
Are our monitoring alarms properly configured to detect failures in a timely manner? Even the best backup strategy can fail if our alarms are not set up correctly.
Are we collecting right metrics (technical metrics and business metrics)?
Do we conduct thorough post-mortem analyses to learn from failures and prevent their recurrence?Final ReflectionsSo, iterating again Murphy’s principle ""Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.” Are you prepared for your next outage?While no one desires an outage, it is prudent to be prepared for the unexpected in our ever-changing world. It is wise to be proactive before such events take us by surprise. These strategies are designed to build trust in our applications, allowing us to detect any unforeseen problems at the earliest stages. Prioritizing resilience is vital for sustaining seamless operations, safeguarding customer trust, and securing long-term business prosperity.We at Tietoevry have all the expertise to ensure your business is safe and secure with us. Whether you are a small business or someone in the transformation journey, our utmost responsibility lies in safeguarding the trust of your customers while you place your trust in us.I hope you enjoyed reading this!Charu Upadhyay", Charu Upadhyay ,Data , 19.6.2023

These are the challenges that we are all facing. Transforming those challenges into opportunities to improve our processes and businesses is in alignment with our vision at Tietoevry to create purposeful technology that will reinvent the world for good.Packaging looking at demand growthThe explosive increase in e-commerce during Covid lockdowns all over the world immediately carried over to the packaging industry. This almost overnight change in consumption patterns is continuing. The carton and board industry are therefore looking at consistently high, even growing demand globally.By 2023, the global production of pulp and paper will reach 490 million tonnes, and according to projections made by Pitney Bowes, 100 billion packages will be shipped worldwide in 2023.Tissue demand rising along with living standardsTissue is another fast-growing product area, especially in markets where standards of living are rising. Asia is the geographical area where the growth of this segment is strongest. Because of the low margins, tissue needs to be produced in a smart way and close enough to the end markets, balancing price, and quality.Go digital to copeTo address those trends, we foresee a lot of companies to increase their focus on new sustainable product development.

Lukas Bard: Protecting businesses and societies makes each day purposeful,/en/blog/2023/06/career-story-lukas-bard/,Meet our people / Lukas Bard / 15.6.2023,"- Technology has always been around when growing up, says Lukas, as my dad always wanted to show me what was behind the appliances and gadgets we used, the 1s and the 0s. At the time I was more interested in playing hockey and football or gaming – but I believe it has been the main reason for my IT career.During his studies in international business and entrepreneurship, Lukas took some courses within IT. Whereas the typical career for his classmates has been within business development, these courses made Lukas go in another direction. - I was drawn to cybersecurity, mostly because protecting businesses and societies makes each day purposeful and secondly because the cybersecurity field is growing rapidly, which is fun and creates opportunities and learning.Big is beautifulLukas could have worked with cybersecurity in many places but chose Tietoevry because of its size. - With 24 000 employees in total and around 500 employees working on cybersecurity alone, there’s no doubt that Tietoevry has the competence and capacity to take on big challenges.Being big also means there’s room for different competencies and perspectives, of which Lukas is a prime example.- I’m a great believer in cross functional teams, where you can address a problem from different angles. That allows us to get more perspectives. Our size allows me to focus on what I do best and explore new challenges. That’s the kind of company I want to be part of.Vulnerability managementLukas works mainly within the field of vulnerability management and has the lead responsibility for Sweden.- It’s all about finding the factors that will fix the most critical vulnerabilities and lower the risk exposure at the same time. Our job is to give our customers insight and recommendations on how to strengthen their security posture by closing potential gaps in their protection.Being proactive and creating trust is key to Lukas and his teams’ success. - To protect our clients, we must be one step ahead of those who try to attack them, the threat actors. That means being proactive, not only handling occurrences as they happen, but preventing them from happening. One successful attempt from a threat actor can have devastating consequences. To succeed we need to work together, consultants, customers, and the government.For Lukas, a key part for working together is trust.- We have the technical skills needed to be on top of our game, and I think my background allows me to have a value adding and customer centric perspective. In sum, this creates a relationship built on trust.Flexibility and freedomTo describe the working culture Lukas highlights two traits that make him thrive and grow.- You’re given a lot of trust and freedom here at Tietoevry. If you’re curious and driven, there’s no limit to what you can achieve. There are vast opportunities to learn, but that also means you must be able to navigate your way through all these opportunities. My learning curve has been very steep. In addition to freedom, there’s flexibility. - I’m given the liberty to find my own way of working, both with regards to how I approach problems, but also where I work. At the same time, colleagues are there to support you when needed, and I’ve had a lot of very valuable input from my mentor. This combination of freedom and flexibility on one hand and support on the other, is invaluable.Join our team and reinvent the world.

Mattias and Elias: Using AI and machine learning to combat bullying,/en/blog/2023/06/mattias-and-elias-using-AI-and-machine-learning-to-combat-bullying/,Meet our people / Mattias Holmgren / 15.6.2023,"- We’re both working on a project where we’re using AI and machine learning in an initiative to stop bullying, says Elias.- If this project is a success, we will create significant change for tens of thousands of young Swedes, adds Mattias. Bullying is something most people can identify with, which makes it quite tangible and meaningful to try to counter.The project is done in co-operation with the children’s rights organization Friends and Örebro University, with funding from Vinnova.Digital twinsElias and Mattias are using digital twins to find patterns that can identify unwanted behavior.- We’re conducting a pilot where our technology gathers data and tries to find patterns in pupils who are either being bullied or are at risk of being bullied, says Elias. We’re using machine learning and AI to uncover what we don’t already know and prevent and give us a head’s up before bullying takes place.The process of identifying bullying has up until now been a manual and therefore time-consuming process. - We want to use AI to analyze data faster and more efficiently, continues Mattias. We’re using text analysis of children’s own words, where we’re responsible for data collection, analysis, and the interface with both the kids and teachers. We’re at the stage now where we are training the models to be as accurate as possible.A team effortThere is a 6-person strong team from Tietoevry on the anti-bullying project, with 3-4 people from Friends and Örebro University. - In this project we have an architect, a project manager and us developers working together as a team, says Elias. We can also ask just about anyone at Tietoevry if we have any questions or need help, there is a great spirit of co-operation here.Not only are the colleagues knowledgeable, Mattias also describes them as passionate: - My colleagues at Tietoevry are passionate about technology and have a drive that is unparalleled. I, like many of my colleagues, spend some of my spare time learning new technologies and exploring gadgets, because I find it fun and stimulating. Being around such people is a privilege.Mattias also mentions long discussions over a cup of coffee and the Swedish tradition of “fika”.- We discuss a lot and share information in informal and formal settings. We’re driven by solving problems as a team. I have a personal interest in learning more about AI and machine learning and have found many like-minded colleagues.Mentor and buddyOn the topic of team spirit, Elias and Mattias mention the benefit of having both a mentor and a buddy. - As part of the graduate program that I took part in, says Mattias, I was given a mentor. He acts like a professional guide, helping with my career development. It has been of great help to me.In addition to a mentor, new employees are also assigned a buddy. - A buddy is more of a social mentor, adds Elias, someone to help you navigate the more personal sides of working here. Little did I know that Tietoevry for example has a social group for Whiskey and wine tasting. If that’s not your cup of tea, you can choose from a long list of other alternatives. There’s something for everyone here.Join our team and reinvent the world.

ChatGPT and Deepfakes,/en/blog/2023/06/ai-and-chatgpt/,Data / Mikel Echegoyen / 14.6.2023,"As we become accustomed to living with AI products and services, ugly aspects start to appear underneath the marketing and hype: Unsettling Bing Chat AI sessions and ChatGPT hallucinations, Tesla cars crashing, image classifications labelling people as animals, AI bots spouting racist and nasty comments, recruitment tools introducing bias against women or automated systems unjustly accusing 20 000 minority families of tax fraud. The list goes on.With more and more sensible topics such as medical, financial, and legal matters getting the AI treatment, governments and societies have started to demand guardrails around AI. This has resulted in regulations such as the EU’s AI Act, USA’s Executive Order 13960 , the AI bill of rights and the OECD AI Recommendations, as well as frameworks such as the NIST AI risk management frameworks. The World Economic Forum maintains a long list of resources for AI fairness as well. While a good step forward, these are still proposals or recommendations, and have little to no teeth to be enforced, and not easy to apply in practice.Easier said than doneProving that an AI/ML model is trustworthy is very hard in practice, especially for large models like GPT. By trustworthy we mean valid and reliable, safe, fair and non-biased, secure and resilient, explainable and interpretable, and respecting privacy. This means expensive, complex, and requiring quite a lot of time (and knowledge) to get right.To put things in perspective: just ensuring non-bias is a tough call, with many types of bias to account for (societal, statistical, mathematical, etc.) and tradeoffs between bias and fairness: between group/individual, fairness, and utility, etc. Add ethical topics to the mix and things gets trickier: should an autonomous car protect the passenger or a pedestrian in case of unavoidable collision? (Check the MIT moral machine and test your own choices!).It's tough, is not enforced, should we be giving up then?We cannot yet fix all the issues, but thanks to quite a bit of research, industry collaboration and the release of various open-source projects by the AI community, there are solutions coming available and being taken into use right now.In the area of explainable AI (XAI), initiatives such as the Linux Foundation’s Trusted AI , Microsoft’s InterpretML (including their Explainable Boosting Machines), Independent work such as the explainer dashboard  as well as the implementation of techniques such as LiME (Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) into the most popular Machine learning frameworks and libraries, provide tools to understand models better and provide visualizations to both educate your C-Suite and the non-expert users too.For Privacy, TensorFlow Privacy, Opacus for PyTorch and other libraries implement privacy-maintaining methods such as Differential Privacy (DPSGD- Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent), or PATE (Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles). Federated learning is also supported, allowing a limited exposure of data by doing Machine Learning training across multiple decentralized devices holding only local data.In the security side, you can use the Adversarial toolbox from the Linux Foundation, CleverHans or FoolBox to make AI models more robust against adversarial attacks such as Evasion (e.g. forcing improper outputs, such as masking a traffic signal to fool an autonomous car), Poisoning (adding bad data samples to the training set), Extraction (guessing the parameters of the model to later do evasion), and Inference (leaking private information).For bias and fairness checks, from the Linux Foundation there is the AI fairness 360, TensorFlow’s Responsible AI toolkit (including fairness indicators), or FairLearn (including fairness metrics, mitigation algorithms, and visualizations).For Large language models (LLMs), there are attention score and internal and low-level pattern visualization tools like Bertviz, and LLM models like GopherCite (by Google Deepmind) that aim to provide source citation and references for its outputs by using Google search. But it´s still early days towards looking inside these large black boxes.In summary, unless adopting best practices is made easy, convenient, and practical, with working code readily available for the AI community to use and practitioners contributing to the common pool, hundreds of whitepapers, government frameworks, position papers and recommendations won’t move the needle towards having trustworthy AI by default. Unless recommendations become laws with strong teeth and requiring compliance, making this a risk management and compliance exercise instead. But who wants to work under a big stick? I rather focus into having the carrot.", Mikel Echegoyen ,Data , 14.6.2023
From humanities to an engineer in a technical field,/en/blog/2023/06/from-humanities-to-an-engineer-in-a-technical-field/,Meet our people / Anna Matela / 13.6.2023,"As a visual person, I like web design and I’ve been doing it in various hobby projects and at work too ever since my family got their first PC in the late 1990s. However, I didn’t specialise in IT at school and my degree was in history and museum studies. In the summers I earned extra cash as a museum guide.Once I’d completed my master’s in the early 2010s, I had small children and instead of moving into a career in the museums sector, I decided to go into hospitality. What was supposed to be a temporary solution absorbed me for years – mainly because there was a lot of work available and the flexible working hours suited our family situation. At some point, however, I came to the conclusion that I wanted more out of my career and I started seriously thinking about changing sector.Fascinating problem solving and detective workI started studying information and communication technology on a hybrid programme at Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences in autumn 2019 at the age of 35. The sector I was aiming to enter was software design, i.e. coding. It was a bit challenging at the beginning as when the course started I didn’t know how to produce a single line of code and we plunged straight into C# (which isn’t exactly the most beginner-friendly computer language out there).With peer support, working closely with my fellow students, I got to grips with my studies and soon found I really enjoyed coding. It’s fascinating problem solving and detective work in a class of its own, where challenges and opportunities just keep on coming. I also got interested in UI/UX design, although there were very few courses in it available in the sector I was looking to move into.In the very first year of my course I managed to get a summer job and work experience in technical customer support for Tietoevry. It was wonderful to quickly get a “proper job” where I learned huge amounts over a short period of time. I gained experience, my professional self-confidence grew, and I got lots of additional motivation for my studies. With a few more holiday jobs under my belt, a couple of years later as I came to the end of my ICT studies, I applied for and got my current role as a DevOps Engineer with Tietoevry.In my final year of study I was working full time in the industry, which perhaps slightly slowed down the completion of my degree. However, now I’m at the happy point where I’ve finished my degree project and that’s been assessed and my degree certificate has just turned up by email. Job done, career sorted – and right on time! I’m quite proud of myself. It turns out you can do lots of things with a humanities degree, including becoming an engineer in the technology sector.Join our team and reinvent the world. For good.

Why Banks Must Act Now To Benefit From Real-Time Payments,/en/blog/2023/06/why-banks-must-act-now-to-benefit-from-real-time-payments/,Digitalization / Anders Olofsson / 13.6.2023,"Anders Olofsson, Head of PaaS at Tietoevry Banking explains the opportunity for banks in real-time payments – and what they should do now to prepare for the opportunities ahead.On the face of it, real-time payments are booming across Europe – but positive surface figures mask some underlying issues. World-wide, the real-time payments market was worth more than $17 billion last year according to Grand View Research[1], with growth set to outstrip 35% year-on-year between now and 2028. In Europe, however, Mordor Intelligence[2] tell us that growth is relatively anaemic at 24.3%, around a third of what we are seeing in developing Asian economies. And there’s less good news from the EU, too, which reported[3] that just under two-thirds (61%) of payment institutions had signed up to its SCT-INST scheme by Q1 2022 – with just 11.48% of account-to-account payments in the bloc made using real-time payments in the year to March 2022.Unlocking the potential of real-time paymentsConsumer and SME demand for real-time payments is well established. But meeting this demand means making sure that banks have their systems in order first. In practice, this means banks should clarify the clearing mechanism they use for their various payment methods (real-time payment or batch payment), then seek to move a significant part of their batch payment volumes to real-time clearing – especially as the EU will mandate the use of SCT-INST from Q3 2023.To start with, banks wouldn’t have to offer these products as instant payments, since in many use cases the existing overnight or end of business day settlement periods work acceptably. However, they should be preparing for the future – and that means scheduling payment workloads more efficiently by taking into account considerations such as the available liquidity, processing power and energy costs required to run their systems.By preparing their systems for real-time payments before offering real-time products to customers, banks will position themselves well for the huge opportunities that lie ahead, including variable recurring payments for subscriptions and bills, request to pay services and more. In the UK, a leader in Faster Payments that’s set to introduce Variable Recurring Payments later this year, instant payment volumes grew by 23% last year, and small businesses are now more frequent users of instant payments than of traditional batch payments[4].Services based on real-time payments like Variable Recurring Payments or Request-to-Pay are not just faster and more convenient for payers – they also help build customer relationships for the companies receiving payment. What’s more, companies can use real-time payment services to improve their cash flow management, working capital flows and reconciliation. As real-time payment services develop, we’ll also see further product opportunities for banks such as splitting utility bills between people who share apartments or deferring regular payments to help consumers manage their cash flow.At Tietoevry, we have developed a payments Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that includes real-time payments facilitation and recurring instant bill payments for the whole of Europe. To unlock the promise of real-time payments, please get in touch: payments@tietoevry.comNB! If you're at EBAday 2023 in Madrid between 20-21 June 2023, we'll be happy to discuss the growing use of account-to-account payments with you at our stand #39!Book meeting![1] Grand View Research, January 2023, “Global Real-time Payments, 2023-2030”[2] Mordor Intelligence, January 2023, “European Real-time Payment Market”[3] The European Commission, July 2022, “Real-time Payments Update”[4] Finextra, 19 August 2022, “UK Faster Payment Volumes increase by 23%”", Anders Olofsson ,Digitalization , 13.6.2023
How does the customer portal support internal (sales) efficiency?,/en/blog/2023/02/the-customer-portal-creates-efficiency/,Digitalization / Jonas Prosell / 13.6.2023,"The pursuit of greater productivity often centers around two key areas: sales efficiency, and scalable customer service. The potential benefits extend far beyond that. The good news is that the objectives of enhancing customer experience, and boosting internal efficiency don't have to be at odds with each other. (stay tuned for more on that topic) What's more, it adds an extra touch of joy for employees when they get to work in a modern and forward-thinking environment.Digital selling and self-service through customer portals do not replace personal sales and customer service, they complement each other. Customers want to be able to choose between the digital channel and the personal one, depending on what suits them best. They also expect consistent information and a cohesive approach. To live up to this expectation, the customer portal should not be an isolated application that operates independently. We believe that all sales channels should work together so that the sales team can benefit from the information gathered about the customer through the customer portal. Information on the customer and digital exchanges with the customer becomes an integrated part of the sales process.Who should be involved in the project?If we involve the salespeople and customer service staff early in the process of designing the next customer portal, we are most likely to achieve a better solution in meeting customer needs, but also for increased productivity. We have great experience of this approach, from projects we have implemented with clients. Salespeople gain more confidence in the solution's functionality and how it is meeting customer requirements if they have been involved and provided input throughout the journey. This in turn will make sales a driving force in promoting the solution to customers. A high share of customers using the customer portal is obviously a prerequisite for success.The customer portal provides the selling company with the opportunity to serve more customers with lower effort, while salespeople can focus on providing advice and expertise to their customers instead of handling information or acting as order receivers. It also makes the sales job more enjoyable by removing more routine tasks that are instead automated and managed by the customer themselves.When the ambition to offer digital sales and service aligns with customers' own preferences, well, then there is no reason not to offer them this opportunity.Engage sales and customer service by:


Expected outcome:




Requesting input in the development project


A better solution for the customer portal




Training the sales team and encouraging them to invite customers to pilot test the solution


Increased confidence in the functionality of the solution




Preparing demos that can be used in customer meetings to showcase the customer portal


Increased customer onboarding




Creating incentive programs for the sales team


Sales promoting onboarding and utilization frequency of digital interfaces




Creating sales-supporting tools and features


Increased sales efficiency




Automating mundane tasks


Increased employee satisfaction and sales efficiency




Gathering information about recurring issues, questions and problems from customers


Improved customer journey and customer satisfactionMore benefits!There are productivity gains to be found in customer service, when the customer can easily find answers to common questions and perform recurring transactions. It can also provide the selling company with the opportunity to streamline other behind-the-scenes processes. This may involve production planning and logistics, for example. We see that the customer portal often acts as a catalyst for digital transformation, which often enables further productivity improvements. More on this in my next blog.The companies that succeed in aligning their digital efforts with personal sales tend to grow faster. Additionally, valuable insights are generated that we can leverage for innovations and new revenue streams. Through these insights, we can benefit from an enhanced and expanded offering.The role of the IT department in the projectPrimarily, it is the business that sets the requirements when we design the solution, especially the key individuals who have close customer relationships. Therefore, it is not typically the IT department that takes the driver's seat in these projects. Instead IT plays a crucial role as an enabler, ensuring a scalable technical solution allows the business to grow in the future.So, when transactions are automated, information retrieval becomes effortless, and customer service seamlessly flows, you're ready to fully utilize the true potential of a flexible and scalable customer portal. It acts as a gateway that enhances the customer journey and drives your profitability to new heights. The beauty of it all is that, when properly designed, the goals of creating a better customer experience and a more enjoyable workplace align with increased internal efficiency. Not bad at all, wouldn't you agree?In the next chapter, I will tell you more on how digital commerce becomes an icebreaker for digital transformation.Read part 1/5 in my blog series: The customer portal is hotter than everRead part 2/5 in my blog series: The right functionality for value creation.Read part 3/5 in my blog series: How to smartly build a value-creating customer portal.Read part 5/5 in my blog series: Digital Commerce serves as an icebreaker för digital transformation", Jonas Prosell ,Digitalization , 13.6.2023
How to drive responsible AI adoption in the fintech industry,/en/blog/2023/06/ai-in-banking/,Data / Jon Bremnes / 12.6.2023,"In an era of fast evolving technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the software development landscape. But behind this technology lie pressing questions around code review, intellectual property rights and ethics. Is AI a boon for software companies, or does it pose potential pitfalls that could undermine the very foundation of software development?For Tietoevry Banking a leading Nordic powerhouse for financial software and payment services, these questions are of paramount importance. Tietoevry Banking's nearly 3,800 experts cater to over 400 financial institutions and banks, in the Nordics and globally. As a software-driven business, Tietoevry Banking is always pushing the boundaries of innovation and digital engineering. AI, already leveraged in solutions such as speedy and accurate processing of loan applications and preventing financial fraud, already add significant value for both companies and citizens. Yet, the rapid evolving technology also introduces a set of challenges we must address with utmost caution and responsibility, particularly when developing fintech solutions for millions of users worldwide.This has become even more pressing with the introduction of ChatGPT, which changed the AI landscape for good. In this blog post, I will shed some light on how Tietoevry Banking is working with AI in a responsible and careful, yet adaptive and innovative way.AI: A double-edged sword in software developmentWe find ourselves at the frontier of a remarkable shift in the software industry, courtesy of AI. Tools like Github Copilot and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and now with tech giants like Google and Microsoft also entering the space, have significantly enhanced code review and solution creation processes. However, these tools are not to be considered authoritative for code development or solution design. We still heavily rely on our talented human developers for security assessment and quality assurance of any AI-assisted or generated code.When it comes to Intellectual Property Rights, we tread carefully. At Tietoevry Banking, we manage a broad portfolio of IPRs across our diverse range of solutions designed to cater to our global customer base. Policies are in place to prevent unintentional exposure of our internal code during AI-assisted code reviews. We also modify any AI-generated code to safeguard our ownership of all IPRs related to our products and services.The question of copyright for AI-generated content is complex and is unlikely to be legally settled for some time. Our approach is to ensure our content, though sometimes inspired by AI, is unique enough to be considered our own and communicates our distinctive tone of voice and expertise.Ethical and responsible use of AI at the coreEthics and responsibility lie at the core of our AI strategy. Guided by a clear AI policy and a set of pragmatic rules that define control principles, risk ratings, and governance levels, we are committed to creating responsible AI solutions. Every proposed AI solution undergoes an initial review to determine the appropriate governance level. We're also fully prepared to comply with upcoming regulations like the EU's AI Act.Our history of creating innovative solutions, such as one of the first internet banks in the Nordics, is a testament to our commitment to pioneering change. We develop and host thousands of large-scale solutions for our banking customers, and AI plays a key role in several services. We already leverage AI and Machine Learning technologies in solutions to speed up loan application processes and preventing financial crimes by detecting fraudulent behaviour. As we further integrate AI and ML technologies into our solutions, we adhere to our policies ensuring transparency in decision-making, unbiased use of data, and ethical conduct.AI offers near limitless possibilities, but it is essential to remember the importance of ethical, legal, and quality standards in harnessing its potential. As AI continues to redefine solution design and software development, our mission is to deliver innovative, reliable, and responsible solutions that address the challenges our customers face.Please reach out if you would like to discuss this with us – I’m happy to hear your thoughts, potential worries, or ideas!", Jon Bremnes ,Data , 12.6.2023
Maja Legernæs: Loving the combination of working with hard and soft skills,/en/blog/2023/06/career-story-maja-legernaes/,Meet our people / Maja  Legernæs / 8.6.2023,"- To put it quite simple, I’m a translator, says Maja. I talk with clients, get an in-depth understanding of what they need and want to achieve, and work with our technical staff to translate that into technical solutions. I love this combination of working with hard and soft skills. Maja and her colleagues work with a wide range of cyber security topics, from access management to vulnerability management, risk management, threat intelligence, monitoring and incident management.- Working together with colleagues is a big part of my day. I really enjoy brainstorming ideas with others, be it for a presentation, a technical solution, infrastructure, or something simple as an e-mail. Even though I worked very much alone on my master’s degree, and loved it, it turns out that working closely with others is even more rewarding. With around 500 cyber security specialists at Tietoevry, Maja has no shortage of people to bounce ideas off and get input from.Cyber security, a field of increasing importanceCyber security is of increasing importance, and sometimes Maja needs a time-out from thinking about the impact of her work.- We contribute to basically everything people need to live, society to function and businesses to operate. It would become somewhat overwhelming if I were to think about the importance of my job all the time. At the same time, taking a step back in a hectic day and reflecting on what I do gives me a boost. It’s all about striking the right balance – thinking, but not overthinking. Maja has adapted a pragmatic and realistic approach to her job, knowing that she can’t predict or prevent all things that could go wrong. - I accept that I can’t prevent everything, so it’s more about being ready and prepared to deal with the unforeseen. We simulate crisis scenarios on a regular basis, close security gaps and know what to do when we are needed.Maja and her colleagues are well prepared for the present, while keeping an eye on the future. The field of cyber security is fast-paced and becoming even more sophisticated.- Hackers become better at their job every day, and our job is to stay one step ahead of them. It’s an exciting race, we must up our game continuously. Just as other trends do, malware and techniques used by hackers change constantly. From simple denial of service attacks to using quantum computers to crack algorithms we never imagined can be cracked. The field of cyber security is wider in scope than most imagine. There’s no shortage of areas in which we can and have to develop our expertise. I say: Bring it on!Flexibility in its true senseFlexibility is a key word for Maja when it comes to her preferences at work and working remotely is one dimension of this flexibility. - At Tietoevry, there is no “one size fits all”, which is a big plus for me. I can decide where I work and there are no outdated rules about how often you must be in the office.There is also great flexibility when it comes to your field of expertise. - I know that my manager would support me if I wanted to change my domain, moving away from cyber security. I have had many colleagues who have switched, both to and from cybersecurity. A final aspect of flexibility Maja appreciates is the work/life balance. - When I’m on, I can be 100% focused, but I also have the right to log off. No one expects me to respond to e-mails after hours. I know many other companies claim to have such policies but don’t always practice what they preach. Tietoevry does, thankfully. Join our team and reinvent the world. For good.Visit our career site!", Maja  Legernæs ,Meet our people , 8.6.2023
Tone Jensen: A star who let’s others shine,/en/blog/2023/06/tone-jensen-a-star-who-lets-others-shine/,Meet our people / Tone Jensen / 7.6.2023,"- I believe my greatest achievement has been fueling the development of all the graduates we have hired, says Tone. My most important job as a manager is to see young talents for what they can become, support them, and give them opportunities to grow. Just like someone did for me, when I started in programming, with time became a solutions architect and now lead a department. Today, 50 % of the colleagues in her department are graduates who joined in 2020 or later. - I will never get tired of seeing young talents shine and fulfill a potential they perhaps weren’t aware of.Maybe the most important app you’ve never heard ofTone works in the department for card issuing at Tietoevry and had the idea for an app that is used by hundreds of thousands of consumers – without them knowing. - The app is basically a digital extension of your credit and debit cards, where you can administer them, make changes, add Apple Pay and Google Pay and give you insights. It’s used by a great number of banks, airlines, retailers – integrated in their own services. That’s why very few people have heard of the My Cards app, but it’s used across the Nordics, the UK and Ireland.Developing an app like this demands highly competent colleagues in a wide range of technical disciplines. - We don’t only work with app development, frontend applications and user experience (UX), but we also must understand the banking system, compliance demands and ever-changing regulations that go with this very important part of our daily lives. We must also balance increased security demands and increased expectations for great UX.Being in charge of change togetherIt’s not only regulations that change in the card issuing domain – Tone and her team are also committed to meeting evolving consumer demands. - I have been in this business from the first digital banks that we developed in Java, to people now using their mobile banking apps on the bus as the most natural thing in the world. It has been fascinating and fun to witness and to be part of this development. The future of the industry is still uncertain, the scenarios are plentiful. - To cater to new generations, we must explore gamification, personalized experiences and make things much more instant. Supporting instant virtual payment cards - which will reduce the need for plastic, paper and transport and sets focus on sustainability. My two daughters don’t really understand why we need a physical payment card when they can simply tap their phones, and it’s hard to argue with that. I’m also very curious about the influence of generative AI on our line of work. Another critical issue Tone’s team is working hard on is stopping various fraud tactics without making the apps slow and difficult to use. - We can’t not solve this issue, seeing that it’s extremely important not only for us as individuals but also for society to function. Even when she is not 100 % sure about the solution, Tone knows how to get there. - I believe the key to success is putting very smart people in the same room and giving them the freedom to solve problems the way they see fit, fostering a collaborative environment and knowledge sharing. That’s the kind of spirit that both my team and I thrive in.Join our team and reinvent the world. For good.Visit our career site!", Tone Jensen ,Meet our people , 7.6.2023
ChatGPT and beyond: What is the impact of generative AI on information work,/en/blog/2023/06/chatgpt-and-beyond-what-is-the-impact-of-generative-ai-on-information-work/,Data / Data  Insiders / 7.6.2023,"AI (Artificial Intelligence) as a term was coined already in the 1950s and started to gain new interest during the 1980s and 90s with neural networks and computer vision. Natural Language Processing (NLP) took focus in 2000s with models that were able to understand human language. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) – transformers – have revolutionized the game by being able to consume large amounts of data without supervised learning.OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model gained significant attention as it was able to perform various natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, summarization, and question-answering. ChatGPT, using GPT model as its foundation, made the ground-breaking technology available to everyone, attracting users in record time.“Generative AI was a user interface problem that was solved. ChatGPT gave a good user interface to an already existing service. The advantages of these tools are accessibility and ease-of-use” says Lukas Lundin, Data and AI Go-to-market Manager at Microsoft, who has a front-row seat to all the latest developments.Listen to Data Insiders podcast episode with Lukas Lundin on Spotify.Learn to ask good questions – Prompt Engineering is the new skill for knowledge workersOther recent tools from OpenAI are Codex, which can convert human language into code and transform one piece of code into another programming language and DALL-E that generates images from human language.Lukas Lundin advises that organizations should encourage everyone to experiment with these technologies and practice prompt engineering, which is becoming an essential skill to every information worker.", Data  Insiders ,Data , 7.6.2023
Tietoevry Banking’s solutions help banks to stay competitive,/en/blog/2023/06/veturi-new-data-and-ai-solutions-for-credit-area/,Digitalization / Aleksandr Peussa  / 6.6.2023,"In recent years, squeezed margins and increased competition have significantly changed the banking business credit area. As a result, to remain competitive banks must invest more and more resources into cost optimization and new revenue generating models.From its pole position, Tietoevry Banking has acknowledged three crucial factors that we think should be accommodated in the business models of banks to stay competitive. First of all, banks have to review the components affecting the pricing. Instead of looking mainly at credit risk, they should consider components such as ROI, churn risk, and price elasticity. Second, instead of averaging the pricing by big segments, banks need to consider more individualized approaches that use pricing components which enable more accurate predictions. And third, banks should consider new technological aspects of the solutions available through public cloud providers.Tietoevry Banking’s solutions take all these three aspects into account. Our individualized approach utilizes the most modern data science techniques capitalizing on high intensity public cloud computational power and storage capacity. This means that instead of high-level segmentation typically used in the banking industry, our applications can analyze and predict the outcome at the individual level of each end customer of a bank. We aim to create products that are scalable and can be applied in different banks with minimal modifications.Holistic approach to solutionsTietoevry Banking has done extensive research in the credit area, covering the full life cycle of the loan process optimization. Our proof-of-concepts stand on a solid academic foundation with a strong business acumen. Based on our holistic approach, we tackle the problem from different angles, addressing the issues from the initial customer acquisition phase up till the portfolio management of the existing customer base. Some examples of our POC investigations covering various parts of credit domain include:Churn risk: predicting the customer’s churn probability and recommending an optimal interest rate based on a bank’s existing customer behavior data.
Credit hungriness: proactively recommending top-up loans by quantifying an existing customer’s willingness to apply for another loan using machine learning methods.
Price elasticity: keeping the optimal portfolio profitability, while maintaining sales volume at a desired level. The idea is to target customers more elastic to interest rate changes to balance sales volume by impacting only a small share of potential customers.Good basis for new product offering creationOur current solutions build on the conventional data sources utilized in banking related to accounts, transactions, socioeconomic factors, and risk related predictions. As our empirical investigations with additional data sources support, we believe that we can improve our solutions by enriching the data sources with completely new ones. However, the conventional data sources can be complemented as well with additional records.Inviting new partners to our ecosystemThe work we have done so far has increased our competence and improved market positions in the credit area. With the strong fundaments in place, we can accelerate the development and productization of the concepts through co-operation with various players in areas like banking and modern cloud technologies.Through the ecosystem of Trusted Digital Societies programme we are looking for partners who can bring additional know-how in the technological side of solutions, who possess data that can improve our solutions, or the ones who know how to create data that is currently not even existing on the market. Please get in touch with us to discuss the possible co-operation in banking business with the aim to increase Finland’s competitiveness on the global market.

Will the future be card or phone payments? Why the answer could be both...,/en/blog/2023/06/will-the-future-be-card-or-phone-payments-why-the-answer-could-be-both/,Digitalization / Hans Sjölund / 6.6.2023,"The digital revolution has enabled a new generation of payment methods, from digital wallets through to wearables, crypto-currencies and account-to-account transactions. Some estimates suggest1 that half of the world’s population will use digital wallets stored on mobile devices by 2050. However, our new white paper explains that such statistics only tell part of the story. As new research from Payments Cards and Mobile2 shows, the use of payment cards actually grew far above trend across Europe coming out of the pandemic.The number of cards in circulation last year grew by 20% more than the long term average across Europe, at 5.18%, while spending on cards shot up by 16.35% percent – more than three times the long-term average. Despite the much-hyped consumer preference for digital wallets in e-commerce, cards remain preferred for online shopping in key European markets such as the UK (51% of transactions) and France (53.9%), and neck-and-neck across the whole of Europe, with cards used in 42% of all online transactions compared to 44% for wallets.In our white paper, “Is the future card or phone payments? The answer could be both”, we show how consumer familiarity, trust and convenience are key factors behind the ongoing popularity of cards. For instance, a study conducted by Visa USA and The Strawhecker Group during the pandemic revealed3 that 65% of US consumers preferred using contactless payment cards in any payment scenario for their familiarity and convenience.What’s more, the last five years have seen new features such as near-field communication (NFC) contactless transactions, biometric security and multi-function cards that feature debit and/or credit, loyalty, buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) combine to make cards more relevant in the digital age. Over the same period, mobile device penetration has exceeded 100% in most developed economies. Rather than seeing mobile wallets displace cards, our new white paper reveals evidence of a growing symbiotic relationship between cards and phones, whether that’s card management apps such as the Tietoevry My Cards app, or the use of a digital wallet linked to a payment card as seen in 61% of wallets4.Download our new white paper now to see five different use cases in which mobile phones and cards can work together to deliver more services and greater security, speed and convenience in payments.", Hans Sjölund ,Digitalization , 6.6.2023
Some say payment cards are yesterday. But they could be key to the future…,/en/blog/2023/06/some-say-payment-cards-are-yesterday-but-they-could-be-key-to-the-future/,Sustainability / Hans Sjölund / 2.6.2023,"Amid all the hype about a digital future in which consumers transact instantly between their accounts using digital wallets, it can be easy to lose sight of the present – and, indeed, what’s going to happen next. While there’s no doubt that the longer-term future of payments is digital, that doesn’t mean cards won’t feature in that mix – and based on current evidence, they are more popular than ever.In a new white paper, we argue that payment cards are more popular than ever coming out of the pandemic – and that banks must include them as a key part of their payments strategy for the next five to ten years. For instance, PCM’s Digital and Card Payments Yearbooks 2022-20231 show that card use grew above trend across Europe last year. The number of European cards in circulation grew by 20% more than the long term average, at 5.18%, while spending on cards shot up by 17.64% – almost twice the long-term average. What’s more, cards still constitute 57.3% of all cashless payments on average across 33 countries in Europe, with credit transfers and direct debit payments responsible for a majority of the remainder.Consumers love cards – and they’re getting strongerIn our new paper, “Card use keeps growing – the strategic implications” we examine why cards remain so popular with consumers – and what it means for banks. Sources vary in their exact percentages, but research undertaken for the European Central Bank in late 20222 suggests that 55% of consumers in the euro area prefer to pay by card, while research for Visa from a year earlier3 says 65% of US consumers are most comfortable with contactless card transactions coming out of the pandemic. There may be a number of reasons for this preference, not least consumer’s familiarity with the card as a payment instrument during the challenging times we’ve experienced, as well as the convenience of paying with a contactless card.What’s beyond dispute is that contactless card payments have accelerated usage over the last five years, while new multi-function cards that combine debit and/or credit functions with loyalty, buy-now-pay-later and other products have enhanced the card’s utility. Finally, new security features, from biometric cards through to 3DS2 on the acquiring side have all helped to shore up the security and comfort users have with card use.NB! If you're at Money20/20 in Amsterdam between 6-8 June 2023, we'll be happy to discuss the growing use of cards with you at our stand C80!To find out what growing card use means for your bank’s payment strategy, download the new white paper from Tietoevry now.", Hans Sjölund ,Sustainability , 2.6.2023
Why celebrating Pride is so important,/en/blog/2023/06/why-celebrating-pride-is-so-important/,Sustainability / Trond Vinje / 1.6.2023,"As the Head of HR for Tietoevry, I consider the question of whether we as a company should celebrate Pride or not a no-brainer. The answer is obvious: Of course we should! There are primarily two reasons for this. The first one is that it aligns with our core values of openness, trust and diversity. The second is that even today, in 2023, members of the LGBTQ+ community are still facing discrimination, both in the workplace and in society at large. Pride is a yearly reminder of this and of the fact that equal rights call for continuous attention and action from all of us across the world.This became all too clear last year here in Norway when the Pride parade in Oslo had to be cancelled after a violent episode where a popular gay bar was one of the targets. This makes participating in this year’s celebration particularly meaningful. For Tietoevry, it also highlights the importance of sending a clear signal to the global community that we are, and always will be, a proud ally of the rainbow community.One issue that often comes up when talking about organizations participating in Pride and walking in the parade is that of pinkwashing, meaning that they declare themselves to be an LGBTQ+ ally, but act differently in practice. I hope that our commitment as Tietoevry is clear. For us, participating in Pride is one visible and important way to show support to diversity, human rights and equal opportunities. Participating in Pride, however, is not enough. For a workplace to be truly inclusive and safe for everyone, we also need formal principles in place. For example, Tietoevry’s Code of Conduct unequivocally states that we have zero tolerance for any kind of discrimination, and we have a whistleblowing system in place for reporting any concerns anonymously.For us at Tietoevry, Pride is about taking a stand, living our values, and doing what is right. That is why I am very much looking forward to again joining many colleagues in the parade in Oslo on the 1st of July, and happy that Tietoevry will walk in the parades in Helsinki and Stockholm as well. It is also why I think the Pride movement for equal opportunities – for everyone to be seen and accepted just as they are - is essential not only in June but all year round.Read more about our plans for Pride 2023 here", Trond Vinje ,Sustainability , 1.6.2023

Embracing the Cloud: Conquering your Fear of the Unknown,/en/blog/2023/05/embracing-the-cloud/,Cloud / Charu Upadhyay / 17.5.2023,"Source: https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/home/F_Apollo_11.htmlWhen Neil Armstrong placed his left foot on the rugged terrain of the moon on July 20, 1969, this event caused quite a commotion as it marked the first human footprint on the lunar surface. I am not sure how that came across to you, but for me, it was a moment filled with wonder, realizing that someone had reached the place that we see in the sky every night. This marvellous achievement has not just been gigantic leap of faith. This was preceded by numerous manned and unmanned space missions, each of which shattered the ceiling by its predecessors in terms of accomplishments.Moving to cloud is a journey and we cannot make it to the journey if we keep worrying only about the outcome. Sure, this path might look complex, risky, full of roadblocks and unknown. There will always be a lot of questions, such as how long it will take, when it will end, the risks involved, when we will begin to see a return on investment, and so on. All these questions are valid and important and does require attention and consideration while developing your migration journey. However, the crucial idea is that if we love the journey, we can get to our destination. During the process there could be times when things may go wrong right away, and that is perfectly OK. There is no one-size-fits-all strategy because every firm has a different journey to the cloud. Hence, it is important to understand this journey requires a long-term commitment and continuous learning. As a result, reaching the goal could require several attempts and different strategies.Connecting to the right peopleWe require a reliable partner to rely on, just like we do in our daily lives. Someone who can relate to our thoughts, comprehend them, and be there for us through both our highs and lows. The cloud's journey is not particularly unlike from it. It is crucial to connect with the right trusted partners and stakeholders who shares your vision and value, someone you can rely on, who can help you navigate tricky situations while ensuring the safety and privacy of your data and systems at its core. Choosing right people is crucial for the success of any business, as a business partner can significantly impact the direction, growth, and culture of the company.""Data security and compliance at the highest level""Every business revolves around data, and it is everything to it, hence, it must be handled with utmost care especially when laws and regulations are evolving and stringent. EU (European Union) Laws like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) which lays down 99 articles outlines strict rules for the collection, processing, and storage of personal data and imposes severe penalties on organizations that fail to comply with its provisions. Organizations with substantial amounts of distributed data imposes complexity on its realization as there may be multiple local regulations and standards that need to be followed. Similarly for data governance, concern is of the visibility, how and where the data is stored.While this may be seen as a challenge to commence your journey to the cloud but not anymore. As with the right measures and guidance in this direction, we can achieve a balance, while leveraging the cloud for keeping the data safe and at the same time remaining competitive and innovative in the market. Some of these measures include Sovereign cloud solutions on Nordic soil, having proper policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance across all business operations, data encryption (at rest and transit), conducting regular compliance audits internally as well by an independent party, establishing incident response and business continuity plans to respond to data breaches in a timely and effective manner and much more.After data privacy and security, the first and, in my opinion, most crucial phase in your journey to the cloud is a high-level assessment of your infrastructure, which is then followed by migration and post-migration. We shall discuss the ""high level assessment"" and its significance in this article.""Stages of your cloud adoption process""Business argumentRecognizing the requirements and investigating the advantages of the cloud for business. What is the business use case we are aiming to solve, and how will it change in the cloud from the conventional arrangement? This can help determine whether there is really a true need to go to the cloud. The anticipated costs of the cloud deployment and how the cloud environment will be configured.Application PortfolioUnderstanding which applications can or should be moved first and whether they are suitable for a cloud environment. There will be some applications that can be easily moved to the cloud, such as a simple lift and shift from on-premises to the cloud. They may, however, require some modification and customization in the code, also known as modernization, before they can be migrated to the cloud. The difficult scenario could be with legacy mainframe applications, which may require complete rewriting of the code, resulting in significant effort. It is crucial to understand which applications are worth moving to the cloud along with the effort and ROI (return on investment) aspects.Selecting the Best Cloud ProviderOnce the analysis has been completed, it is time to select the best partner for you. There are numerous cloud providers on the market, each with a unique set of capabilities. It can be a challenging step, especially when everyone makes the claim to provide the best services and support, but factors such as who aligns more with your business values and the approach, they offer you to address your concerns about architecture, licensing, support, and cost, among others, can help you make this decision.ConclusionNo matter how difficult the path, it is always worthwhile taking the first step even if it is not success.If you want to break free from a closed shell but are not sure how, or if you are interested in embarking on a cloud journey to reap its benefits, a high-level assessment is a foundation that checks your cloud readiness not just from the technology perspective but also from a cultural perspective of adapting to change. We at Tietoevry Create would love to tell you more about this Cloud Agnostic Roadmap which performs high-level assessments and provides general guidance.Do not hesitate to contact us for more information.", Charu Upadhyay ,Cloud , 17.5.2023

The potential of Sovereign cloud in different industries
The road towards digital sovereignty starts nowThe path to digital sovereigntyIn a growing data economy where organizations are increasingly moving their business to the cloud and leveraging the full potential of data, there is a clear dilemma: How can you work collaboratively, grow, and innovate, within the global digital marketplace while complying with new and evolving regulations? It’s in this context that digital sovereignty has gained powerful momentum. In fact, the idea of digital sovereignty, and the related topics of data sovereignty and sovereign cloud (as we shall soon see) have been around for a while. However, they have increased in both popularity and relevance through the rapidly growing amounts of data, challenging cybersecurity landscape, global political turmoil, and changes in international regulations of recent years.So, what is digital sovereignty? In the digital economy, cloud services are becoming increasingly important to be able to use, transfer and store data in a way that is safe and secure. In this emerging landscape, digital sovereignty is about how a state regulates and exercises control over the technology and services in use there. It’s concerned with keeping sensitive data secure and enabling businesses, organizations, and individuals to enjoy greater autonomy over their digital assets and data. Simply put, it’s about controlling where the data resides, where it flows, and who has control over it. With the above information in mind, it’s easy to see the broad societal implications and importance of digital sovereignty – and why organizations need to pay attention. Before digging even deeper into some of the underlying factors driving organizations to ensure their digital sovereignty, it’s worthwhile taking a brief look at two related concepts: data sovereignty and sovereign cloud.DefinitionsData Sovereignty relates to the rules and reference architectures that can help safeguard some of the fundamental principles of digital sovereignty:Data residency (where the data is stored),
Data jurisdiction (who has legal control of the data)
Data protection (the ability to store and process data in secure ways)
Data independence and mobility (the ability to use, store and transfer data freely)
Interoperability and portability (the ability to exchange and make use of data)Sovereign Cloud can be seen as an enabler of data sovereignty. It’s a set of new and dynamic cross-/multi cloud solutions designed to answer to new sovereign policies, balancing collaboration with compliance, and bringing together insight, innovation, growth, and security.Data residency means that the data is stored and processed on servers that physically reside inside the country of origin.Data sovereignty means that the data is in compliance with privacy and integrity laws in the country of origin.Jurisdictional control means that the data is under control by the laws of the country of origin and not by any other third-party country.Overview to Digital Sovereignty, Data Sovereignty and Sovereign CloudUnpacking the emergence and relevance of digital sovereigntyThe modern data economy is growing at a rapid pace. The EU Commission estimates that the volume of data produced in the world will increase from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to an expected 175 zettabytes in 2025. Every 18 months, the amount of data is doubling. At the same time, according to EU’s estimates, the value of the data economy will increase to over €550 billion by 2025, representing 4% of the overall EU GDP.This means that data is power – and that moving your business (or parts of your business) to the cloud has become imperative for both nations and organizations across different industries. Whether you’re running a small e-com business working with a variety of customer data, or working in a multinational corporation tracking multiple sources of data, access to cloud-stored data is increasingly important. The untapped potential of leveraging that data is staggering, with some estimates stating that 80% of all industrial data is never used. One of the reasons that organizations are not using, or getting the full value out, of their data is the digital security landscape that has emerged over the last ten years.During that time, the challenge of where to store data and how to move it from one place to another securely – particularly across borders – has become increasingly critical. Over that same period, European organizations and businesses have been storing more and more data in cloud data centers, often provided by American tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, or Amazon, who dominate this space. Currently, no European player makes the global top 20 list of the most powerful tech companies – a data point that is supported by the fact that 92% of the data produced in the Western Hemisphere is stored in the US. With the amount of metadata that the American cloud providers are collecting being much greater than many people realize (the collection is often automatic and may include data such as IP addresses, credentials, as well as logging and diagnostic reports) the question of how to store, transfer, and use data in safe and secure ways has never been more important. In addition, changes in the global political landscape as well as new security challenges such as an increase of cyberattacks, are also driving companies to bring their data “closer to home” to increase control and sovereignty.The proliferation of data and the emergence of new cloud solutions in recent years have also increased the value and potential of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). While AI and other adjacent technologies have the power to help societies and organizations revolutionize the way they think, act, and work (e.g. through automation and smarter use of data), concerns have been raised about certain governments and organizations using AI systems for morally questionable aims. One such concern is the alleged use of AI technologies by certain authoritarian governments to pilot social scoring systems with the aim of implementing social control at scale, something that has come under intense scrutiny from both the EU and the US.Such movements have posed questions about how AI can be used to its full potential, while safeguarding the fundamental rights, security, and integrity of organizations and individuals. With data being the world’s most inexhaustible resource and the fundamental fuel for AI, the explosion of new AI systems has also led to an increased importance of ensuring the sovereignty of data. Both US and other global cloud players are active in developing new, emerging AI systems and technologies, while also having control over a multitude of data from many sources. As a consequence, it has become even more important for organizations to understand where their data is stored, how it flows, and who controls it.As a response to the above forces, many countries and industries have already established new regulations that require companies to store, process, and manage data safely and responsibly in line with domestic law. EU regulations, such as GDPR, Data Act and Data Governance Act, are all meant to control, safeguard, and enable the flow of data across borders. In a similar vein, the emerging EU AI Act will create a set of rules for developing and using AI-driven products, services, and systems in the EU, and consequently will limit how data can be used by such technologies.Given the drive towards increased integrity and privacy for both individuals and organizations of recent years, these developments are natural. Nevertheless, as we will soon see, parallel developments, not only in the EU but also in other parts of the world, have rendered the regulatory landscape more complex and difficult to navigate.Before we dig deeper into how organizations can accelerate their cloud journeys while remaining digitally sovereign, we should take a closer look at the regulatory landscape and explore a few examples of the regulations and rules that are shaping the playing field in the digital economy.Untangling the regulatory mazeThe introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in 2018, set-off a flurry of new EU-centered and cross-Atlantic regulations. Being the toughest privacy and security law in the world to date, the GDPR set a new precedent for data protection regulations and laws across the globe.As a way to create an improved framework for securely transferring personal data from the EU to the US, the EU-US Privacy Shield came into effect in 2016. However, four years later, in 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) declared the Privacy Shield invalid, due to concerns about the surveillance by US state and law enforcement agencies. This verdict later came to be colloquially known as Schrems II. Schrems II would have significant implications for the use of US cloud services and has irreversibly changed how companies and legislators approach data transfers and user privacy. In practice, the Schrems II ruling meant that customers of US cloud service providers must themselves verify the data protection laws of the recipient country, document its risk assessment, and confer with its customers. In 2019, one year before the Schrems II ruling, US authorities introduced the US Cloud Act, which immediately came under intense scrutiny from organizations within the EU, since EU-based companies who are using a US cloud provider to store/manage their data would be legally obliged to share electronic data with US authorities in the event of a serious crime investigation in the US.A way forward for cross-Atlantic regulationsAs a consequence of the growing uncertainties surrounding the regulations intended to protect and bring legal certainty to data transfers across the Atlantic, the US and EU announced the ambition to update the Privacy Shield agreement in 2022. Based on the dependencies of global data transfers for enabling growth and innovation in both the EU and the US, solving these challenges is of high interest and importance for both parties. The new EU-US Data Privacy Framework is to be adopted by the EU commission, and is expected to be effective during the summer of 2023. The new framework will help ensure that sensitive and critical data is protected from misuse, and provide a trusted environment to enhance digital sovereignty for organizations in Europe and across the globe.In parallel to developments of EU-US regulations, the EU has introduced a number of regulations to safeguard the digital landscape and promote the secure use and sharing of open data (such as industrial data) in Europe. In line with EU’s overall European Strategy for Data, the EU Data Governance Act aims to increase trust in data sharing, strengthen mechanisms to increase data availability, and overcome technical obstacles to the reuse of data. While the Data Governance Regulation Act creates the processes and structures to facilitate data sharing, the EU Data Act clarifies who can create value from data and under which conditions. The Data Act ensures fairness by providing rules regarding the use of data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices.With the increasing cybersecurity threats of recent years, the EU has also launched several regulations and initiatives to safeguard the security and privacy of EU citizens and organizations. The EU Cybersecurity Act is one such initiative. The act increased operational cooperation at EU level and supported the coordination of the EU in cases of large-scale cross-border cyberattacks and crises. In addition, the act introduced an EU-wide cybersecurity certification framework for ICT products, services, and processes. As touched upon earlier, the proliferation of data and the increasing number of new AI systems have also given rise to new, emerging regulations. The main one is the much talked about EU AI Act. The goal of the AI Act, which is expected to be finalized this year, is to regulate AI applications and align them with EU’s overall values and fundamental rights. The Act is also intended to be a predictive tool that allows both societies and businesses to continue to grow and innovate within the digital economy by reaping the full benefits of AI technologies, in ways that are safe and secure.So, with this new-found knowledge of the regulatory landscape, you might ask: How should my organization act? How do we make sure that we can stay compliant with regulations while achieving the benefits of moving to the cloud? How can we become more digitally sovereign and what are the steps to get there? Thankfully, these are exactly the kind of questions we will delve deeper into in the coming chapter.Sovereign cloud – the enabler for achieving data sovereigntyGiven the regulatory landscape that we have painted above, the question that many CXOs, regardless of whether they’re heading up an international bank or spearheading a public sector organization, will ask themselves is: How can we continue to work collaboratively, grow, and innovate, within a global digital marketplace while complying with new and evolving regulations? With the increasing importance of moving their business to the cloud while extracting the full value of data, many CXOs are under pressure to find solutions that can help improve competitiveness and deliver on business and growth goals, while also ensuring security, privacy and sovereignty of critical data.In this context, there are a few key things to consider. As we have already seen, the emerging regulatory landscape has kept certain industries and companies from transitioning to the public cloud, since businesses and organizations would commonly have a hard time complying with regulatory demands. Thankfully, solutions are now being worked on to make it easier to exploit and unlock the full value of the increasing amounts of data, while adhering to the demands posed by various regulations. This is where sovereign cloud comes in.As we saw earlier, sovereign cloud is one of the key enablers for becoming digitally sovereign. Sovereign cloud offers increased security, compliance, and control, and a means of future-proofing your business and driving innovation. Let’s dig a bit deeper into what a sovereign cloud solution does, before outlining a number of key steps for organizations and businesses to accelerate their cloud journeys in a secure and sovereign way.At the core, sovereign cloud is about protecting and unlocking the value of critical data. A sovereign cloud solution helps ensure that all data, including metadata, stays under one jurisdiction and prevents foreign access to data under all circumstances. Considering some of the challenges we have touched upon above, this is more important than ever before.A sovereign cloud solution provides a trusted and secure environment for storing, processing and transferring data across borders in a safe manner. Sovereign clouds are mature and well-established solutions that are part of an emerging multi-cloud landscape. They also provide core benefits of cloud such as agility, security, and automation, by helping organizations and businesses put the right data, in the right cloud, with the right level of sovereignty.A roadmap to sovereign cloud – a step-by-step guideSovereign cloud should be a core part of any multi-cloud strategy, intended to pair security and compliance with business growth and innovation. Before outlining our step-by-step guide towards adopting a sovereign cloud solution, it’s worth emphasizing that such a transition demands an understanding that not all data is the same and that there are differences between clouds. The clouds have different values, and organizations should consider using their various strengths and capabilities, side-by-side, to reap the most benefits out of their data. So, to future-proof your business, your organization needs data classification and a multi-cloud strategy that can secure safe data flow across different environments and ensure business continuity. This strategy must comply with global, local, regional, and industry-level regulatory requirements.This journey toward sovereign cloud starts now. Here are a few key steps that organizations and businesses should consider to become more digitally sovereign.1. Assess and Map – A good first step is to classify your data and map the application usage of that data. In addition, assessing current data locations and applications. A few useful questions to ask are: How can our data be categorized? How and through what applications is our data used? Where is our data currently stored and where does it flow? Is any of our data transferred outside the EU?2. Govern and Steer – As a second step, you should create a Chief Data Privacy Officer role and set-up the right data governance and data policies, both organizational and technical, that will guide you going forward.3. Plan and Design – As a third step we suggest defining future data flows, data architecture and future infrastructure needs. Given our earlier data classification, how will that data flow going forward? What data architecture will allow us to reap the maximum benefits of our data, while ensuring security and sovereignty? What future infrastructure needs can we foresee?4. Transform and Implement – In the fourth step, it’s time to execute on the planning of previous steps and deploy the right data and workloads in the Cloud.5. Run and Manage – The fifth and final step is all about running the sovereign cloud solution. To extract the maximum value of the solutions, it needs to be updated and new workloads need to be added to ensure efficiency and privacy, and unlock cloud innovation.Tietoevry Sovereign cloud - A holistic solution leveraging people expertise and technological powerTietoevry’s sovereign cloud solution helps organizations and businesses put the right data in the right cloud with the right level of sovereignty, while getting access to the values from running their business on the cloud. All this is done in a simple, automated and industrializedway, using capabilities powered by both humans and technology – a symbiosis of people and machine. Let’s have a closer look at how Tietoevry uses these two complementary strengths to deliver a holistic solution,and how it can help organizations and businesses through the roadmap sketched above.People – The cloud expertsThe expertise of people is at the center of any cloud journey, from the beginning to the very end, ensuring a simple and adequate design phase, a smooth migration, and regulatory compliance, while generating business value. At the beginning of the cloud journey, people and their knowledge are essential to evaluate the baseline. What are the key categories of data? Where, how and by whom is the data used? Those kinds of questions, although seemingly simple, require both knowledge and experience to properly address. As the cloud journey moves into governance and steering, people are key to setting the right data governance structure and defining policies that will guide how organizations and businesses use the cloud. In this context, there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and it’s important to understand the capabilities, needs, and goals of the organization in question.In terms of planning and design, people’s expertise is important to gauge what the future will look like. Through experience from multiple projects and scenarios, our people have the skills and abilities to define future data flows, set up a data architecture, and anticipate infrastructure needs relevant for the unique needs of each and every organization or business.People are also essential to any successful migration to the cloud. A well thought-through plan and preparation are nothing without good execution. Also, people are essential to ensure continuous security and compliance monitoring while running the application in the cloud, also making sure that applications are kept up-to-date with the latest versions.In short, people are the experts that make the cloud journey simple, helping businesses and organizations realize and maximize the value of their cloud journeys by setting transformation frameworks and best practices, being there to ensure a smooth migration to the cloud and adhering to the expectations on security and safety. People are also an integral part of building and using technology in a purposeful and responsible way. Technology is a double-edged sword that can be used to do both good and bad, and that’s why we rely on the experience and judgement of our people to help build, deliver, and run solutions in a way that’s responsible for both customers and society.Technology – The operational machineryOur technology is what powers the sovereign cloud solution, complementing and amplifying the work done and experience held by people. Our technology not only represents the fundamental cloud infrastructure that allows the solution to run and function, it also includes the capabilities that enable the solution to be updated and new workloads to be added, while continuously  ensuring efficiency and privacy. The infrastructure part of our technology is the foundation for any cloud transformation, and usually comprises of a mix of Tietoevry’s own cloud services together with clouds from hyperscalers, such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. In addition, it’s usually a mix of private, hybrid and public clouds.On top of the cloud infrastructure, the sovereign cloud solution runs on a unified platform that simplifies operations and management of sovereign apps and data. The platform allows governance of a multi-cloud solution, capacity/workload management in real-time, and can help automate the entire IT landscape for an organization or business. Our customers can rest assured that the data and applications that reside on our sovereign cloud solution is always compliant and in line with regulatory requirements. If a specific data set needs to reside in a specific geographical location and be subject to locally governing law, that data set will never be moved to a public cloud.However, not all data is created equally, and with our sovereign cloud solution you get the perfect mix of private cloud and public sovereign cloud capabilities, and any combination of them. An important capability of a cloud platform is AI and Machine Learning. The benefits of AI and Machine Learning are many, but from an operational standpoint the increased operational efficiency enabled by predictive and dynamic insights with higher accuracy, faster decision-making, increased visibility and faster root-case analysis, stands out.As we have seen, the perspectives of people and technology complement each other. People are important for ensuring a smooth and successful cloud journey from start to finish, while the technology provides the technical foundation that allows business and organizations to run, manage and improve their cloud solutions. Let’s have a look at how the combination of people and technology can help organizations and businesses across different industries make the most out of their data and cloud journeys, while staying safe and secure – with the help of a sovereign cloud solution.The potential of sovereign cloud in different industriesSovereign cloud for the public sectorChallenge: With continuous changes in regulation and the need for secure cloud services to keep sensitive national data in safe hands, public sector organizations have had a longer adaptation period to the usage of cloud.Solution: With Tietoevry sovereign cloud, public organizations can start adapting most of their services into the cloud, ensuring compliance with regulations and standards while keeping the data safe with security clearances and under local jurisdiction.ValuesAccelerate modernization

Higher demands for sustainability information in new EU regulation,/en/blog/2023/05/pimpoint-2023/,Digitalization / Jonas Prosell / 15.5.2023,"In this blog post, we reflect on the benefits of preparing for the new regulation expected in a couple of years. We also discuss how PIM (Product Information Management Systems) and other technologies can help create profitable solutions that encompass the entire value chain, including reparability and other important characteristics for circular models.The EU's digital product passport should not be seen in a negative light. Sustainability is already high on the agenda for most companies. We see that EU's digital product passport promotes and opens opportunities for profitable and sustainable consumption and production. The central importance of product information for sustainability was actively discussed during this year's PIM Point, hosted by inriver. The emphasis was set from the opening speech and remained the guiding and inspiring theme throughout the event that took place at Slagthuset in Malmö on May 9th.The central role of product information in facilitating critical business decisionsBusiness-to-business (B2B) digital trade has evolved to encompass higher values and more complex products, which means that professional buyers now have higher demands for detailed product descriptions and specific criteria to make critical business decisions. It is essential for customers to find the right product as erroneous purchases can lead to serious consequences. To support the purchasing process, we need to build a model for product information that provides support throughout the buyer's journey. This includes not only the customer's decision-making process but also support, service, and guidance in the crucial aftermarket.Customers' need to assess the sustainability of a product, in combination with the new EU regulation, puts increased pressure on companies to provide detailed and traceable product information that discloses the environmental impact of the products and their components. Product information becomes an even more crucial and critical resource to meet these requirements.Creating sustainable service commitments in B2B industriesIn various B2B industries, machines, tools, and equipment are utilized for extended periods. By creating an efficient and user-friendly model and process to relate articles to each other, it becomes easier to find the right spare parts and related products. This contributes to improved conditions for streamlining usage and extending the lifespan of products.A strong trend we see among our industrial customers is that this, in turn, facilitates the launch of service offerings and new types of commitments and pricing models. This is called servitization, where the company shifts from solely selling products to selling a complete service commitment.In addition to efficient product information management, industrial companies often develop solutions that involve a combination of technologies, such as using sensors connected to machinery and IoT (Internet of Things) technology to transmit data for analysis. By utilizing well-developed algorithms, they can set up service reminders or perform proactive maintenance to extend the lifespan of products and reduce unnecessary waste or part replacements. Here, we see significant opportunities to create sustainable and profitable solutions.Promoting environmentally conscious purchasing decisions through easily accessible product informationFurthermore, consumers and companies that use these products often face time constraints, which hinder them from conducting their own research to make environmentally conscious choices. By providing information on product sustainability and reparability, awareness of product sustainability can increase. It is likely that companies that succeed in clarifying environmental information also have the potential to positively influence demand. By facilitating wise purchasing decisions for customers, we can create leverage that further promotes the development towards sustainable consumption.The product passport opens significant opportunities for profitable businessOur conclusion is that the EU's digital product passport and customers' demands for sustainability increase the pressure on companies to provide detailed and traceable product information, creating opportunities for sustainable and profitable solutions. By utilizing PIM, IoT, efficient data structures, algorithms, and other technologies, we can achieve better and more efficient use of products, reduce waste, and promote sustainable consumption and production. So let's think about how we can take advantage of this development and contribute to creating a more sustainable future.If you need to discuss the possibilities of developing more sustainable models for your products, please contact us at Tietoevry.", Jonas Prosell ,Digitalization , 15.5.2023
Defining the A in RPA,/en/blog/2023/05/defining-the-a-in-rpa/,Data / Viggo Jeppsson / 9.5.2023,"But the context of automation must be defined for it to mean anything specific. Robotic Process Automation, RPA for short, is a business term that is well known for some, and gibberish for others. In my experience, we in the tech consulting industry often manage to hide the message or meaning of something in a sparkling haze of terminology. It might make technology or services sound mysterious and interesting, but if the message is lost then what’s the point? By the end of this blog post, you’ll see what I mean, I hope.So, to make sure we share a frame of reference I’ll start by defining these two terms:AutomationIs generally defined as the use of technology to perform tasks or processes without human intervention, with the aim to reduce manual labor, improve efficiency, reduce errors, and increase productivity by replacing manual or repetitive tasks with machines and/or software.That makes sense, but it’s still generic. We can use it in reference to a bunch of different markets, technologies, and professions. There’s Manufacturing Automation - involving the use of machines and robots to perform various functions in factories, then there’s Test Automation – involving the use of software tools to run automated tests in software applications to ensure that they function properly. And then there is:Robotic Process Automation (RPA)It’s defined as the use of software robots, or bots, that are using pre-programmed rules and algorithms, to perform mundane, repetitive, and rule-based tasks that otherwise would have been performed by humans. Some of the key benefits of applying RPA in an organization are increased efficiency, improved accuracy, enforced compliance and security, and not to mention the treasure trove of mental and social benefits that stems from employees not experiencing stress or feeling unfulfilled at work. It can be applied in all kinds of industries and organizations since there is busywork everywhere.The term itself is somewhat problematic since the word “Robotics” is commonly used in reference to physical machines. Like that dog-looking thing that won’t fall if you kick it, or a robotic arm that places caps on tubes of toothpaste in a factory. And the word process just means a series of steps or actions that are taken to achieve a particular goal. The point is that semantics can be confusing and sometimes unnecessarily so. Anyways, the term “RPA” has been used for years now and is fairly dug in, so one might say we’re stuck with it.Now, before I get to the juicy part of this blog, let’s have a quick history recap.RPA as we know it today has been around for a while, but compared to other technologies and disciplines it’s a young one. It can be traced back to the early 2000s, when screen scraping technology was first used to automate manual tasks that involved interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It wasn’t until the early 2010s that the term “RPA” was coined, and the technology began to gain wider recognition and adoption. During the late 2010s we saw several specialized RPA platform vendors pop up, such as Robocorp, UiPath and Automation Anywhere, that each provide a set of tools to develop and operate bots. It’s been a competitive marketplace and the capabilities of these tools have grown over the years, evolving from simple screen scraping and GUI interaction to the application of various types of AI to automate more complex tasks.Moving on.I entered this field in 2019 and quickly became enthusiastic about it. Many of the tools provided by platform vendors were low-code and, paired with easily accessible online learning resources, it was surprisingly easy to get the hang of using them. Easily accessible marketing and sales material, as well as the general hype, made it easy to sell consultants and services. And the idea of building cool tech, fast and cheap, made the field feel like a golden ticket.And it seemed to work.But after having worked for a while and delivered a few bots, I had this uncanny feeling. Everyone in this field seemed to act confidently, but behind the scenes there was often an air of insecurity. I’ve racked my brain on it for years and have some thoughts on why that was the case, and sometimes still is.And yes, here comes the juice.The hypeAs with many emerging technologies, there’s a lot of hype and buzz surrounding it. But hype is a double-edged sword, it can draw attention, spark interest, and inspire action, but it can also lead to misunderstandings and unrealistic expectations about what that technology can do. When contracts are drawn up and big investments are made, and the underlying expectations of implementation time, effort and ROI are not met, the people responsible for realizing those expectations are put in a tough spot. It can lead to strain on customer relationships, unsustainable working environments and the loss of talent, as well as the branding of the technology field as just a fad, not to be tried again.Buzzword overloadWith hype comes a lot of buzzwords. Overall, they can be useful for marketing and promoting awareness of new technologies, but they can also cause a lot of confusion. One buzzword associated with automation and RPA is “Intelligent Automation”. This term implies that bots have intelligence and are capable of learning and adapting on their own, which is not entirely accurate. Forms of AI, such as machine learning and Large Language Models like ChatGPT can be applied to enhance the capabilities of bots, but the use of such tools is not a given. In many common use cases of Automation, it’s far from necessary to apply any real form of AI, or “intelligence”, to get the job done well.Another issue with buzzwords in the automation market is that they can make it difficult for customers to differentiate between automation tools and services. There’s Robotic Process Automation, Business Process Automation, Digital Process Automation, Intelligent Automation, and the latest one - Hyper Automation. Why on earth are there so many sub-categories? Do they represent separate technologies, strategies or philosophies? Or are they labels written up by marketing departments?Based on my own experience, and feel free to challenge me on this, many of the platforms and tools that are associated with Automation and RPA/BPA/DPA/IA/HA-services can be used for the same purposes. The tools look different, are based on different programming languages, differ in terms of pricing, licensing, user base and speed of evolution, but most of them can be applied to the same ends. It’s all Automation. What matters is the results we achieve by applying these tools.Wrapping upIn my opinion, the conceptual core of RPA (and other associated terms) isn’t groundbreaking technology. But the tools available to us, and the ease with which we use them, to realize the value of automation is groundbreaking. It’s just that the narrative around it has become way too complicated and it needs to change.So.Let’s forget about the hype, the LinkedIn likes, and which tools are anointed as market leaders this year. And let’s stop adopting every buzzword that’s thrown at us. The tools we use are constantly evolving and we service providers need to stay on our toes and adapt. But we don’t need to rebrand or reposition ourselves or our services every time a new tool or feature emerges. Oftentimes, all that does is undermine us and the value we offer. The purposes and end goals of Automation remain the same. Let’s not make this more complicated than it needs to be.Let’s keep our eyes on the value that Automation can create in the long term, like increased productivity and improved mental health. Let the service provider worry about what tools-of-the-day to use and how to achieve results, and let the receiver focus on evaluating and challenging those results.And that’s a wrap. Feel free to reach out to me and share your own thoughts on these topics. If you disagree, challenge me. I might learn something!And if you liked this post, please tune in to next one where I’ll talk about how we at Tietoevry Create have gone along this path of Automation, failed our way to experience and insight, and built our own playbook on how to realize the potential of Automation in the modern organization.Viggo JeppssonAutomation Team Lead", Viggo Jeppsson ,Data , 9.5.2023
Industrial Metaverse? XR expert Helmut Krämer in an interview,/en/blog/2023/05/industrial-metaverse-for-business/,Data / Helmut Krämer / 3.5.2023,"Dear Helmut, you are the XR (Extended Reality) legend at Tietoevry Austria and therefore the perfect partner for a talk about the Metaverse. Please tell us briefly what the Metaverse actually is.In the gaming sector, people have been operating in the ""virtual world"" for quite some time now. Thanks to the advancement of internet speed and performance (5G), more powerful computers, and increasingly better end devices for VR (Virtual Reality), virtual spaces are being opened up for more and more users and application scenarios. The metaverse is essentially a scalable network in which complex worlds with 3D objects can be displayed simultaneously for almost an unlimited number of users. A multisensory experience is offered: visual experiences are enriched with sounds, language, and probably soon even with smells.How do I move around in the Metaverse as an individual?You move around the Metaverse as a virtual person - as an avatar. An avatar is created specifically for the Metaverse environment and, if desired, can resemble your real image very closely thanks to 3D scanning. Artificial intelligence helps recognize and transfer your facial expressions and gestures to your avatar.What role will the Metaverse play in our work environment?We remember ""Mobile first"", followed by ""Cloud first"". I think soon it will be ""Metaverse first"", as the Metaverse will shape both our leisure time and our work environment. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has already entered into a partnership with Microsoft and other tech giants. In Microsoft Teams, it is already possible to participate in meetings as an avatar. A taste of what is yet to come. The ""Mesh"" platform presented in 2021 is the gateway to the business oriented Metaverse, either integrated into Microsoft Teams or as a direct entry point into the existing Metaverse. The business share of the content available is currently rapidly increasing, even in Austria.The development towards the Metaverse in times of post-pandemic and long-term established remote working seems very logical. Can you give me some examples of the specific benefits?Think, for example, of communication with colleagues in home offices or at locations on the other side of the world, with whom you can hold more ""lively"" remote meetings as an avatar in the virtual space. Complex content or data can be better visualized in the Metaverse. It also serves as a test field for new products and services. Many things are more tangible and easier to understand despite the physical distance between users. Online shops where your avatar can test products are also an example of what is possible or will be possible in the future.And what advantages does the Metaverse bring to industrial companies - now and in the future?The Metaverse offers special benefits to industrial companies. There are already various applications that use Mixed Reality (XR) to assist in industrial operations. In ""augmented reality"", the real environment is enriched with virtual 3D aspects through wearables such as data glasses. For example, at Tietoevry Austria, we have developed an Industrial Metaverse application for the plastic and foam manufacturer Greiner. The Microsoft HoloLens data glasses are used to work on complex industrial machines, enabling quicker resolution of errors and maintenance needs, and speed up the learning process on how to operate the machines. The data glasses project interactive 3D holograms, animations, as well as documents and videos.The term ""Metaverse of Things"" is the next step of ""Internet of Things"" and it is currently on everyone's mind. What is it all about and what benefits does it bring in practice?This goes one step further. In addition to the content already mentioned, real-time data is visualized directly on systems and machines. These come from sensors and make complex circuit diagrams easy to understand - ""real-time"" and in the form of digital twins. I, along with my expert colleagues at Tietoevry Austria, developed a solution of this kind for Wienerberger AG: the Microsoft HoloLens 2 displays digital twins based on real machines using our application. This helps Wienerberger AG with error prevention and more efficient machine operation. There will be much more to report on the ""Metaverse of Things"" in the future.I believe you, Helmut.

Making bill payments more rewarding with Request-to-Pay,/en/blog/2023/05/making-bill-payments-more-rewarding-with-request-to-pay/,Digitalization / Sami  Uski / 2.5.2023,"Following our recent article on instant payments as an enabler for Open Banking, Tietoevry’s Sami Uski explains how bill payments will drive the introduction of new Request-to-Pay (RTP) services across Europe.Consumers in many European countries are now enjoying the benefits of instant payments through wallet solutions such as Swish (Sweden), Vipps (Norway) and services on the Siirto platform in Finland. These services are having in-built Request-to-Pay (RTP) infrastructure that holds immense promise to make future payments services faster and easier – including bill payments.Electronic invoicing has been a huge step in improving the efficiency and sustainability of bill payments: consumers are now used to receiving paperless bills via banking apps or e-mail, and to paying those bills online after logging into their providers or bank account. The next leap forward for consumer payments convenience – and improved cashflow for companies – is to enable one-click or automatic payment of invoices via RTP services. However, there are a couple of steps that need to be taken before this next level becomes reality.Real-time data requiredThe core service in RTP is not the transfer of funds, but the exchange of data between the payer and billing organisation. At present, most e-invoicing systems do not allow billing companies visibility of the entire payments process: while they can see that an invoice has been opened or has been paid, there is at present no link between that status and the movement of funds. It’s possible to change this, and deliver real-time status data through the existing SEPA RTP framework.If we are able to do so – but there’s a catch I’ll come to later – then we will deliver not just more consumer convenience, but also help billing companies to improve their liquidity forecasting and, by extension, their working capital management. What’s more, if we can aggregate payment status data, it can help us to draw out payment patterns to which we can apply AI and Machine Learning to help prevent fraud as well as identifying new product opportunities.Getting the whole ecosystem involvedThe catch I mentioned earlier is that we need to engage the entire payments ecosystem to make this model work. If today a billing company gets confirmation of payment from their bank one day after the invoice is due, our aim should be to make the entire invoicing flow transparent to the company. This would make the entire process transparent and backed by real-time information, just like a peer-to-peer transaction between two wallet systems is today.Achieving this ambition means getting banks, retailers, insurance companies and intermediaries such as fintechs involved. To help make RTP billing a reality, Tietoevry was selected as the Leading Company for NextGenerationEU funded program to run a pilot scheme in Finland called Veturi (the word means “locomotive” in English) under its 5 year Trusted Digital Societies program – building the mission critical building blocks for our society. In a future blog, I’ll go into more detail about this scheme and what it means for everyone involved in payments, from making paying easier to reducing errors and helping to fight fraud.To find out more about Tietoevry’s work to deliver RTP services in Finland and across Europe, contact: Sami Uski, Head of Business Development, Tietoevry Banking", Sami  Uski ,Digitalization , 2.5.2023

Real-time customer data is the key to unlocking business growth,/en/blog/2023/04/customer-data-activation-with-cdp/,Data / Samuel Tenhunen / 27.4.2023,"Modern companies understand that to be competitive, their customer experience must be better than competitors. Many companies manage customer experience systematically, and customer understanding is collected from various sources, for instance by utilizing surveys. The role of customer data is also understood, but its use seems difficult, usually because there is a lot of data in many different systems. Most companies don’t have a real-time pulse on customer experience nor see a full 360-profile of the customer. The behavior of existing customers is not understood deeply enough to, for example, prevent customer churn. To serve customers as well as possible, business should try to know each customer individually, and be able to activate personalized marketing measures in real-time through digital channels. This may sound challenging to implement, although there are existing solutions available.Data silos cause inefficiency and increase costsOne of the reasons for the lack of customer understanding is the challenging data environment, or so-called data silos. Customer data exists in several different systems and there is no overall view to single customer. Each organization has their own systems made for their own purpose. The behavioral data collected by marketing is isolated in marketing systems, and not connected with other customer data. When marketing needs a more complex target group for its activities, target group selection and segmentation either remain at a very rough level or is done manually by data analysts. There is no capability for personalized real-time customer communication leading to generic targeting and modest results. Result is poor activation rates and, at worst, disengagement.Who should lead customer data utilization in organization?Data processing and compilation is usually IT-driven, with the emphasis on developing systems and data warehouses. Thinking about the use cases themselves on a larger scale is usually forgotten. One of the most important customer data user organizations in companies should be marketing, because together with sales and customer service, they interact directly with the customer. The difference of marketing from the others mentioned above is that its task should be to build continuous interaction in the digital channel with the entire identified customer base, throughout their customer relationship. Sales and customer service organizations only encounter a certain proportion of customers at a certain point in the customer's life cycle. In addition, business decision makers want to understand customer data, but for them it is often enough to have customer data visible through various reports and views that help understand business results.Data-driven marketing should be led systematicallyMarketing organization is one of the most important organizations in companies in terms of customer data utilization, but it seems that the marketing teams have limited competence in this area. The responsibility of activating customer data is usually handed to the digital marketing team, where the use of data often revolves around marketing analytics and the target groups needed for email communication. Although both are part of the whole, they do not yet make marketing data driven. However, it is not the fault of digital teams, as they are often small, and the roles and tasks assigned to them guide their focus. The task of building a 360-customer view is not with marketing and for this reason they usually don’t have it available. The responsibility for developing customer data capabilities and data-driven marketing should have a higher mandate in organizations. Data-driven transformation should have an owner that can define marketing needs for IT, owns the budget for the subject area, and gets a mandate to develop capabilities to build a 360-view for activation use cases.Privacy legislation drives the future of customer dataFortunately, many organizations have woken up to the importance of managing own customer data. Big driver for this has been the upcoming elimination of third-party cookies and the increasingly specific laws related to privacy and data protection. As 3rd party data will not be available so easily anymore, the so-called 1st party data (customer data collected by the company) has become an important part of agenda for marketing organizations. How data utilization is taken forward in different organizations is much more nuanced. The responsibility for the big picture often lies with IT organizations, as the budgets of marketing organizations do not cover the acquisition and maintenance of this type of systems. The challenge is, that marketing needs don’t necessarily rise to the top of the agenda, even when they should. IT has the know-how for platform management and the requirements for privacy protection will certainly be considered, but it is not enough to support the company's growth agenda and activation of customer data. Growth can only be achieved when we have use cases for data as the starting point for the customer data platforms requirements. This is where marketing agenda should be prioritized.What is the right place to build a 360-customer view?When companies think about how customer data should be aggregated and managed, and how it can be activated to improve the customer experience and marketing, the focus is easily turned to existing systems, such as CRM. From technical perspective the discussion easily starts revolving around ""data warehouse"", ""data lake"", or ""Master Data Management (MDM)"" development. When it comes to CRM, the problem is that it is not intended to build a 360-view of customer data, but to help sales and customer service work be more efficient. Data warehouses, on the other hand, are too heavy entities to be utilized to activate real-time customer data. They also often lack the behavioral data collected by through marketing channels. All the above are part of the company's data environment, and they must be identified when building a competitive advantage from customer data. However, the so-called 360-customer view aggregation for business growth and marketing need its own capability, one that supports real-time activation of data and provides insights about customer behavior.Customer data activation needs a customer data platform (CDP)There has long been a solution for activating customer data called a ""Customer Data Platform"", or CDP. The idea of CDP is to create a single view of the customer from various sources within the organization under one persistent identifier. CDP then provides that ID to the systems that utilize the data in segments and in real time. , marketing can identify customer behavior, build segments, do personalization, and activate real-time marketing activities. For this reason, CDP is a tool that should be owned by marketing. When marketing use cases drive the acquisition and development of CDP, it is the fastest way to create value for the entire company.At the same time CDP brings ease for the IT teams, as a properly selected CDP provides a wide range of out-of-the-box integrations to the company's data systems. This means that IT team don't have to put so much effort into building, developing, and maintaining the customer data platform. The challenge is, that that very few marketing organizations in Finland seem to have experience with CDP, and they do not know how to demand one. This means that the customer view development and the related tools are often left to the IT organization to choose and develop. This may be one of the reasons why the market in Finland seems reasonably underdeveloped for the business growth use cases and there is still a lot of untapped potential for business in activating their own customer data.CDP selection should be done carefullyOne challenge with the CDP field is that it is full of very different solutions. Depending on the source, it can be estimated that there are about 200 CDP providers worldwide. Each of these have different strengths and qualities, but of course there are also common denominators. The most important common denominators are that a CDP must be able to import customer data from other systems, compile one customer and persistent identifier, and then be able to activate that. How many ready-made integrations and functionalities are available is a completely different matter. Some provide very limited number of integrations, and some CDPs are part of a SaaS service package that focus on completely other features in their stack development. Others offer a very wide range of integrations and are built as standalone products, giving companies the freedom to choose which data sources to use and which marketing tools to use in activating the data. For marketing organizations to be able to choose the appropriate CDP, it is important to identify the needs with at least the near future in mind. In future, a correctly chosen solution will also support adding new data sources, increase customer understanding throughout the business and help marketing become more personalized as the company's requirements grow.The 360-customer view is the mainstay of improving the customer experienceWhen customer data is compiled into a 360-view, it is easier to start developing the customer experience in all interfaces. Businesses no longer must rely only on small survey samples or outdated CRM data when looking for customer understanding. The customer's life cycle, the purchases made, interaction with marketing and websites, as well as the feedback to the company, can be monitored from a single view, and this information can be activated not only in marketing, but also for example to support customer service, sales, and product development. Activating customer data opens a lot of new opportunities that will be the lifeblood of improving the company's competitiveness in the future.Would you like to discuss how customer data could be used to improve the customer experience and grow the business?

SHE 2023: Highlighting the benefits of diversity,/en/blog/2023/04/she-2023-highlighting-the-benefits-of-diversity/,Sustainability / Kia Haring / 21.4.2023,"The event, which took place in Oslo on the 19th of April, is Europe’s biggest gender equity conference. In her opening remarks, CEO at SHE Community, Astrid Rønning Skaugseth, emphasized the importance of diversity when it comes to tackling issues like poverty and climate change. To do so successfully, she said, we need to bring together people with a wide array of backgrounds and experiences.More womenFor Tietoevery, the SHE conference was a great opportunity to talk about why it is imperative to get more girls and women interested in IT and technology. Managing partner at Tietoevry, Evi Seljevoll, emphasized the importance of this as one of the panelists in an engaging talk on embedding social sustainability in the workplace.“In the tech industry, we develop technology for the entire society. Therefore, it is crucial that we get more women to join our ranks. If not, we risk ending up with solutions that are more suited to men than women”, Seljevoll said from the stage.Managing partner at Tietoevry, Evi Seljevoll, (second from the left) together with her fellow panelists: Kamilla Sultanova (left), Christin E. Bøsterud and Yvonne Thompson CBE.The many benefits of recognizing the importance of diversity were a theme that several speakers touched upon throughout the day. From former Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg to author and activist Salamatu Kamara the message was clear: embracing diversity benefits everybody and is an important step on the path towards a more equitable future.Knowing your biasesUntil we get to that future, however, being aware of one's biases is key. This was one of the key themes in a workshop that Chief Designer at Tietoevry, Simon Kavanagh, together with Business Developer Mikaela Fri, gave at the conference. In it, they talked about how important it is that everyone who is working on developing new technology is cognizant of their own biases and the limitations of their experiences. If you are aware of this, you can try to bridge this gap by actively seeking out people with experiences and perspectives different than your own.“It is obviously important to have policies in place, but that is not enough. Being aware of your own biases is crucial for developing good tech, and I am very happy that we got a chance to share this message with some of the participants at SHE,” says Kavanagh.SHE, however, is not only about tech, and the various speakers and panel discussions touched upon a wide range of issues from the importance of more gender diversity in sports to the fact that embracing diversity also means embracing yourself for who you are.“We are proud to have been a partner of this year’s SHE conference, and will take the insights from the event with us as we continue working on our ambitious diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda,” says Kia Haring, Head of Communications and Sustainability at Tietoevry.SHE Conference 2023 in Oslo

Hence, the systems are classified according to risk, based on whether they pose a clear threat to citizens' rights or safety, endanger critical functions, whether people can decide for themselves if they want to use them, or whether they are free to use applications such as spam filters using AI.Banking industry is one of the most regulated industries, and any AI solution related to banking will be considered a ""high risk"" application from an AI regulatory perspective, which will set strict requirements on the trustworthiness and governance of the solutions.Potential for a new export area in European regulatory technologyTietoevry, Aalto University and Turku University are initiating a co-research project which will help financial institutions using AI capabilities and products to be compliant with the upcoming EU regulation. AI capabilities and products include, for example, credit scoring services and other solutions that affect people's borrowing.The aim of co-research project is to develop a governance framework and support technical capabilities for the AI solutions of the banking process, develop a systemic view and concrete guidelines for auditing and governing AI systems in banking and insurance, and evaluate the mathematical theories, algorithms and concepts on concrete use cases.Tietoevry is coordinating the project, in addition to which it offers anonymized data and strong expertise in the banking industry to support the research. The aim is also to ensure that the company’s AI products like Sales Optimizer or Profit Scoring are in line with the future legislation. These AI powered solutions have been developed solely for banks, helping them to balance risk and maximize the overall profitability they receive from their lending business, whilst keeping the overall lending volumes at a desired level.University of Turku develops solutions and tools for implementing responsible AI in practice, whereas Aalto University is responsible for the transparency, personalized explainability and integrity of the models.We are inviting new growth companies to the project steering group.

Today’s economy needs new payment services for SMEs – here’s why.,/en/blog/2023/04/new-payment-services-for-smes/,Digitalization / Anders Olofsson / 13.4.2023,"However, the popularity of instant payments with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is less well publicised – yet such payment types are growing as fast as their consumer equivalents. In Great Britain, UK Finance tell us that 39% of all business payments were instant in 2021[1]. Meanwhile, 1,300 German Banks now offer instant payments to their corporate clients – more than 93% of all banks[2] in the country – while a recent estimate suggested[3] that the French economy would benefit from a 2.8% boost to GDP thanks to the use of instant payments by SMEs. Although the Nordics, the Netherlands and the UK have led Europe, other markets – especially Germany and France – are catching up fast in terms of SME instant payments.Instant payments: vital for survivalInstant payments aren’t just convenient and fast for SMEs: they matter for survival as the economic landscape changes and the need to generate cash more rapidly grows. At present, interest rates have risen from near zero to around 4.25% in the UK and 3.5% across the Eurozone. This shifts the cost of money for SMEs from almost nothing to a significant balance sheet factor. An SME with a loan facility of €200,000, for example, might now expect to pay an interest rate of around ten percent on that money – quite some cost for a business with a turnover of between €500,000 and €1 million.“the need for more efficient working capital will drive new payment options linked to Open Banking.”In this economic context, SME’s requirements are changing. As well as the capacity to receive and settle funds rapidly provided by instant payments, they also need to make their working capital generate value more efficiently. At Tietoevry, we expect this to be a catalyst for new payment options that help businesses to generate more revenue by offering more flexible payment choices to customers. Furthermore, we expect many of these services to be linked to rapid growth in Open Banking. The implication is that banks, fintechs and other providers will face greater competition – and must be ready to respond.From instant to openSpearheaded by fast-growing Asian economies and now emerging in Europe after the implementation of PSD2, Open Banking will deliver a revolution in choice, cost and efficiency over the next decade. Given the current economic climate, we expect Open Banking services for SMEs and corporates to emerge more rapidly than their consumer equivalents. That’s because demand is soaring from corporate clients for payment services delivered through open APIs that add value.Examples of the new services we expect to see launched include variable recurring payments (VRP) and Request to Pay (R2P). Variable Recurring Payments (VRPs) let customers safely connect authorised payments providers to their bank account to make payments on their behalf in line with agreed limits. In essence, these enable one-click payments for monthly accounts with retailers, membership clubs and subscription services where the amount owed changes from month to month. They offer more control and transparency than a monthly direct debit or card-on-file payment, since the consumer can alter the amount paid, rather than paying a set amount each month. From an SME’s perspective, VRPs can be cheaper than direct debits or card payments, and offer their customers attractive levels of clarity and control. VRPs will be introduced in the UK later this year (2023) and we can expect them to be rolled out in other European markets soon.“banks should be developing open API architectures and next-generation payment services to meet the Open Banking needs of European SMEs”Request to Pay is another revolutionary development which promises to eliminate complex onboarding requirements for one-time or infrequent payments. This involves a payee initiating a request for a specific transaction from a payer. The system provides a digital request that the payer can receive on their mobile device. This could arrive on a mobile banking app, or via a third-party fintech. A payer is then able to accept or reject the payment request. The request to pay can also include transaction details, due date and other invoicing information. If the payer approves the payments, a real-time transfer is initiated to the payee. The transaction is enabled between two parties without the need for to remember or enter full account details, while remaining fully secure – and featuring instant settment.To prepare for these innovative developments, banks should be developing open API architectures and considering international standards in Open Banking such as the UK’s open API standard or NextGenPSD2, an Open API set developed by the Berlin Group. They should also be looking to partner with experienced providers on the development of next-generation payments services that will meet the needs of Europe’s SMEs – traditionally an under-served segment that will be looking for more sophisticated services from their banks in the future.Get in touch to find out more about how you can offer new payment services fit for an Open Banking future: payments@tietoevry.com[1] UK Finance, August 2022, “UK Payment Markets Summary 2022”: https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-08/UKF%20Payment%20Markets%20Summary%202022.pdf[2] See: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/digpub/european_economy/bloc-3d.html?[3] PYMNTS, 1March 2023: “European Real-Time Payments See Historic Growth”: https://www.pymnts.com/real-time-payments/2023/european-real-time-payments-see-historic-growth/", Anders Olofsson ,Digitalization , 13.4.2023
We must rethink the way we talk about technology,/en/blog/2023/04/we-must-rethink-the-way-we-talk-about-technology/,Sustainability / Evi  Seljevoll / 12.4.2023,"Evi has been with the company for ten years, and through her management role she is focused on the recruitment of female leaders and technological specialists. As a mentor and sponsor, she is a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion, and she works actively to encourage girls to pursue a career in IT and technology.The Future of Tech is Dependent on Social EquitySocial equity is crucial for the future of tech because it ensures that technology is developed and used in a way that benefits everyone, regardless of their gender, sexuality, race, age, socioeconomic status, or other factors.According to Evi, it is important to commit to working stategically towards long-term change regarding gender balance and social equity more broadly within the sector because the solutions being developed need to work for all social groups. When people with different life experiences are a part of the process, the value for the end user becomes much higher.Gender BalanceEvi highlights the importance of working towards greater gender balance within the sector as a key factor towards greater social equity on a societal level. Right now, the average gender split within the industry is 30% women and 70% men.According to the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise, NHO, women in industrialised countries only account for 1 of 3 finished degrees within STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics). In a Norwegian context it has been made apparent that while girls generally have better results in these subjects, they are less likely to pursue this when entering upper secondary school.A study by Tietoevry shows that only 14% of girls between the age of 15-25 considers an education or career within tech, in contrast to 44% of boys. Evi explains that a vital part of changing this is to rethink the way we talk about technology.How Do We Talk About Technology?Evi notes that “due to the increased digitization of all areas of public and private life, technology is a necessary dimension for almost all areas of work and interest”. Therefore, technology is not just about the gritty specifications, but also the ethical considerations, usage, and societal role. Working in tech can mean that you work with care, education, and politics, she continues.A love for computers, games, and science fiction can be an amazing entry point towards an education in tech - as it has been and still are for people of all genders.Evi further emphasizes that there are other ways into technology as well, and that you don´t necessarily have to have a background from the average tech perspective. If you are passionate about creating a better educational system, better healthcare, or reducing climate change you can pursue this through specializing in IT and tech. “We live in a technological society, and social sustainability does therefore have to be at the core of what we do,” she explains.“Technology could, and should, be a part of creating a better society. We must be open to both being challenged and about the way we are actively working to create change!”One Glove Does Not Fit AllFrom her 10 years at Tietoevry, Evi has a lot of experience with promoting inclusion within the company. When asked if she has some concrete tips from a management perspective, she gives the following advice:Rethink how you view competence

There is no ‘correct’ trajectory that will guarantee that someone has the competence you need. Lived experiences, cultural background, a more practical education and work-history can all be an important part of developing the varied and invaluable skills needed to create better solutions.


Don’t be afraid of taking risks

Women are less likely to put themselves forward for a leadership position. It is therefore important to encourage this, while also being aware of it so that not just those who always speak the loudest are considered for advancement.


Invest time in the journey

When someone might not have the traditional experience and background, you have to provide the necessary training needed to fill any knowledge gaps and to empower the individual to grow into the role.


Be a good role model

Being a good role model is not only about displaying admirable qualities. It is vital to be vulnerable and open about the challenges within the industry, and the work it takes to navigate and overcome them. Tietoevry’s guidebook created to encourage young women to pursue a career in tech, Being an IT girl, reflects this.“People are different, and this is an asset” Evi continues. We therefore have to reconsider how we talk about technology and our approach to management training and gender balance. These practices must be transparent and measurable!If you are attending this year’s SHE conference, make sure you don’t miss the panel discussion on embedding social sustainability in the Workplace.Read more about our plans for the SHE conference here.", Evi  Seljevoll ,Sustainability , 12.4.2023

How can Data Platform improve Customer Insights?,/en/blog/2023/04/how-can-data-platform-improve-customer-insights/,Data / Ewa  Wollschläger / 5.4.2023,"From a company perspective, this is one way how to use data collected from online activities to understand customer behavior, preferences, and needs. Further on, the ability to create marketing campaigns, optimize offerings and develop new coveted services.Insights don’t always come together quickly or easily when developing ideas and concepts. Mostly, it takes a great effort of time just to get them articulated. Thinking about it, my feeling is that they have to be compelling, without being preachy, and truthful without being too obvious or presumptuous to succeed.What is then the definition of Customer Insight?A deep truth about the customer based on their behavior, experiences, beliefs, needs or desires, that is relevant to the task or issue and rings a bell with target people.What is a good Insight?Digging deeper into the work with Customer Insight is more or less like peeling an onion. Removing the layers one by one and going deeper and deeper exploring the goals the corporates have? Do they see any key activities to reach the goals? Drivers, are those related to being more cost-efficient or something else? Do they see any concerns or obstacles to being able to reach their goals? Which stakeholders need to be involved in in-depth discussions? How can we within the Data Platform make these stakeholders become heroes at their end? If only doing standard market research, it becomes quantitative and you will most likely find yourself on the outer layers of the onion instead of qualitative understanding of the current situation by digging deeper, as when you peel the onion, layer by layer.Data Platforms role?So where to begin? Within Data Platform, we have a long experience in digitalization message flows e.g. the financial messaging area, e-Invoicing, supply chain, and energy messages. This journey started in the late 80s and if I make a brief reflection on where we are today, a great deal is the impact of market-based discoveries by listening and taking advantage of customer behavior, needs, and experiences. Today's society is in a development phase where digitization plays an essential role.Do Customer Insight impact innovation?Yes, of course! These insights are effective and create a guiding path that we interpret and turn into valuable and actionable knowledge for the improvements of our products and services.How do you see this?I´m curious!Don´t hesitate to contact me for further discussion.", Ewa  Wollschläger ,Data , 5.4.2023

Aanchal Chopra: Building an agile future on all fronts,/en/blog/2023/03/aanchal-chopra/,Meet our people / Aanchal Chopra / 31.3.2023,"Aanchal is passionate about agile technologies and migrated from India to Finland a year ago with her infant son and husband, who is also an IT professional. At that time, she had a master’s degree in computer applications and was working as a senior application analyst remotely for a global company. She had worked with the company for seven years and a job change was not on the cards. But Aanchal was ready to explore her options.“I was nervous. For five years, I had been working from home and had not stepped into an office because of Covid-19 and prior to that, my son was very young.”Facilitating a multinational team globallyThe interview at Tietoevry Create was the turning point, recalls Aanchal.“Every time that I have been interviewed, the focus has been on my work experience and professional achievements. But Tietoevry also tried getting to know me as a person and see my potential. That was inspiring and motivating. It made me change my mind and I decided to explore more of what's outside my plate as a developer.”Aanchal joined Tietoevry Create as a Scrum Master last year. She undertook the critical task of setting up a team from scratch and getting processes and scrum ceremonies in place. Her team works for Tietoevry’s customer in the telecom sector.Equipped with in-house toolsets and Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) certifications, Aanchal now manages a diverse team operating from multiple geographies.“I got an opportunity to work in a client-facing role as a customer lead with invoicing and taking care of customer requirements. I could also introduce the team and clients to enhanced working methodologies. Not only that, I learned the SAFe framework from scratch and have implemented it for the team.”Aanchal is now gearing up for a new challenge, to be a project manager in a multi-project team.Finnish companies motivate foreigners to learn the languageOne might wonder how Aanchal has been able to do her work as she does not know the Finnish language.“When I joined Tietoevry Create and started working for its customers, I thought there would be a language barrier because I did not know Finnish. But luckily at Tietoevry, everybody speaks English, which is the corporate language. Also, my Finnish customer is very flexible and most people speak English, especially in meetings and at work.”“But we must understand that sometimes people do tend to speak in their native language. They are not doing it deliberately,” she says and adds that somebody always translates what is said into English.Aanchal is now learning Finnish.“I am going to work here and live in Finland for a long time. I have got a good work-life balance and the education system is one of the best in the world. My son wants to learn Finnish and it only makes sense that I do too.”During her free time, she loves to run and explore the scenic walkways of the seaside district Ruoholahti in Helsinki, as well as meditate in nature.Lately, she dived deeper into Finnish culture when she bathed in snow dressed in a swimsuit.

"Pause, pivot, and find the valuable use case: learnings from Allstate’s conversational AI journey",/en/blog/2023/04/pause-pivot-and-find-the-valuable-use-case-learnings-from-allstates-conversational-ai-journey/,Data / Data  Insiders / 30.3.2023,"We invited Hiremath to share his insights into the benefits and challenges that arise when AI meets the art of human-to-human conversation.Conversational AI is a set of systems that enable humans to have a conversation with a computer, as Hiremath explains. Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri are the commonly used consumer products, where Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) concepts are used to simulate conversation, and where the machine is designed to understand user requests and provide relevant responses. Used in the enterprise setting, conversational AI not only ensures that companies are available at their customers’ preferred time and channel, but also helps respect customers' time by eliminating long queues.Sharpen the use case and scaleAllstate is one of the companies that have successfully implemented this technology. The Allstate team had ambitious plans when they first set out to create a standalone virtual assistant in 2017. The intent was that the assistant could answer any question their agency users had. Even though the solution was built on the latest technologies at the time, they quickly realized that the virtual assistant ended up being just one more tool in front of the users.""We thought we created something valuable, and people would come and use it. But the users didn't see the value. The feedback was that there are too many tools already. We had to take a pause and pivot from there.""Listen to Data Insiders podcast episode with Ajay Hiremath on Spotify.The team set out to repurpose the solution and introduced it in the existing chat channel, as a “first line of defence”, as Ajay Hiremath calls it. If the chatbot was trained on the topic, it would provide the answer. If not, it would connect the conversation to a human representative. This approach started to gain trust among the users, enough for Allstate to eventually shut down the phone channel in the contact center.As a result, the volume in the chat channel exploded and started to cause significant queue times for insurance agents waiting for service. The solution performed well with new users whose questions were simple, but it couldn’t help with complex conversations with experienced agents.The next step for Ajay Hiremath and his team was to change the scope of the chatbot once again, now to route the conversations to the appropriate specialized team in the contact center. This approach took the complexity off from insurance agents’ shoulders and gained good feedback from the users, as it allowed them to ask their question and trust that the chatbot would figure out who needed to address it. As Allstate had now found the narrower use case that provided real value to the users, they were able to successfully scale the solution.“As we saw benefits in agency channel, we ventured into customer service and sales and started introducing conversational AI to all these channels. Now we have a conversational layer in our claims, roadside assistance, and as an employee-facing solution in the contact center.”, Hiremath lists. But what are the key learnings from this eventful journey that took about 5 years and included some twists and turns?“The lesson learned was that we should not think about conversational AI as one size fits all solution. We need to be very specific with the use cases we want to go after, as well as the user community that we are targeting.”Plug-and-play architectureTo make sure they can keep up with the evolving technology, Allstate invested in building their own core technology platform to orchestrate different AI solutions and connect to their existing applications. This gives them flexibility and freedom to onboard Amazon Lex, Google Dialogflow, Facebook Messenger or any solution from emerging niche players, depending on what best suits their needs.Ajay Hiremath sees the integrations to the legacy systems as one of the key success factors for their conversational AI journey, as they enable end-to-end automation of processes. He gives a simple example of a password reset. “One solution would be that a chatbot provides step-by-step guidance to reset the password. Another option, that we prefer, is to provide end-to-end automation through integrating chatbot with identity management systems and enable it to reset the password automatically after authenticating the end-user.”For companies with large consumer and user base, there’s great potential in providing self-service by integrating the latest AI technologies with legacy solutions.“For us to be successful, we need to be 100% digital, and available to our customers in the channel that they want to interact with us at the given time. Conversational AI fits very well into this aim. It is a key component in our ecosystem, and I see the importance only growing in the coming years.”Measuring the performanceAllstate evaluates the performance of their conversational AI solutions by containment metric, meaning how many of the conversations were fully handled by the chatbot. Hiremath is proud of 38-40% containment achieved in the consumer channel.""Out of the million conversations, around 400,000 are completely managed by the bot. That’s a good success for us!""Another key metric is intent accuracy, which measures how well the bot can understand users’ intent. Allstate’s intent accuracy is high: 80% of the time, the chatbot understands the reason why a user is interacting with Allstate. The remaining 20% of the conversations go to the pool of utterances that developers and designers use to optimize the solution.Looking forward to the future, Hiremath shares insight into Allstate´s roadmap:“We want to make our chatbots even more effective. We are also looking at newer technologies and right now our focus is on integrating knowledge graphs into the chatbots and the conversational AI platform itself.”", Data  Insiders ,Data , 30.3.2023
"Are your system integrations secure, governed, and future-proof?",/en/blog/2023/03/secure-and-futureproof-integrations/,Data / Fredrik Tillström / 30.3.2023,"An integration assessment will help you form a reusable, innovative, and efficient integration function lowering your total implementation time while keeping your information exchanges secure and regulatory compliant.With the digitalization journey, comes many challenges, one being how information should be integrated. Adopting new cloud-based services, often with built-in integration capabilities, makes it tempting to take shortcuts for information exchanges. This often introduces a fragmented and autonomous integration architecture leading to:Inadequate access control and incohesive information security.
Point-to-point integrations bypassing integration function.
Lack of governance for the integrations.
Inadequate monitoring and reactive incident management.
Inventing “the wheel” over and over again.If you recognise any of these statements, you are starting to have big problems. With a fragmented integration architecture, it is very hard to know what information is shared, to whom it is shared, and when it is shared, and it increases your attack surface. This is not only of the company’s internal concern, as neglect of security is a breach of regulatory requirements such as GDPR.Importance of a good integration functionGiven this scenario it is vital to find an integration function that fits your organisation’s needs and requirements. A good integration function will help protect your information assets, centralise access control, govern your integrations, allow for innovation, and shorten the implementation and delivery time of the integrations. It is important that the integration function should be fit for purpose and bring value to the business.Value of Integration assessmentThe integration assessment will look at your organisation integration needs from a holistic view. It will have several benefits for your organisation and will give you the following insights:An outside in perspective from a senior integration expertThe assessment is facilitated by a senior integration expert. Utilizing the experience and know-how from the expert will provide valuable insights on your current solution and give new perspectives and innovative suggestions on working solutions fitting your needs.An updated view of your information processesIt will give you an updated view of your current and future information processes and data integration flows. This is important! Having the information as a starting point shifts the focus away from what you can technically do today, to what your organisation want and needs. This step also involves the desired level of innovation, if and how the information should be able to be combined into new value bringing assets.A definition of information security and regulatory requirementsHaving the information processes as a basis, the required level of information security and access management can be specified. It is important to have this under control as it not only protects the proprietary assets of your organisation, but also ensures you meet regulatory requirements.Current governance and processesLooking at your current way of working with integrations will give insight on your organisation’s level of maturity for governance and processes related to the integration function. This is important in many ways and have effect on the integration function’s resilience, security, efficiency, time to market, and maintainability.A map of your current integrationsFinding all your current integrations will shine a new light on the actual integration architecture your organisation has. It is more a rule rather than an exception that shortcuts are being made bypassing the integration middleware. These integrations are often hard to govern, expensive to maintain, and might have security complications. Extending the map outside of the middleware will help your organisation mitigate security issues, improve governance, and lower cost.Your current and future integration capabilitiesLooking at your system’s integration capabilities will allow you to identify gaps between what you can do and what you want to do. This will help you in defining an integration architecture that is suitable and fit for purpose for your organisation.Suggestions on an integration strategy, governance, and target architectureThe integration assessment will propose a strategy and solution that fulfils your needs, fits your budget, and works with your existing enterprise architecture, including a plan for governance and a high-level integration architecture. It will also provide suggestions on technology that is fit for purpose with regards to functionality and cost.A roadmap and action plan to implement a target architectureAn action plan on how to get from your current state to your target functionality including cost estimates and time plan is an important deliverable, making the assessment a decision basis for your organisation’s management.Walk through of the integration assessment processThe integration assessment is facilitated by a senior integration expert. The facilitator has extensive experience with system integration, deep knowledge of integration architectures, and know-how of creating and delivering integration functions.First an overall scope is defined for the assessment. We define a common understanding on what areas should be covered and what deliverables are expected. The scope indicates time needed for the assessment as well as the commitment by your organisation.A series of workshops and interviews are planned. For each event key stakeholders are identified and booked for participation. These interviews and workshops can be divided into five milestones:Kick-offWe define a more detailed scope giving all participants the same view of the assessment. The facilitator informs on working practices and establishes a network of contacts within your organisation.
State analysisFinding current processes, systems, integration capabilities, data flows, and ways of working (governance).
In-depth analysis and definition of target functionality and goalsA more detailed analysis of systems, processes, and data flows is done on selected areas. In-depth interviews with key stakeholders are done where needed. A definition of strategy, target functionality, and goals are set with a technology agnostic viewpoint.
GAP Analysis and solution designGAP analysis between state and target. Design of a governance model and solution architecture. Identify possible candidates for the technical implementation of the integration function. Creation of a road map to reach the target architecture.
Presentation, action plan, estimatesDevelop an action plan to realize the road map. Calculate cost estimates. Present strategy, solution, conclusions, and findings.Stakeholders from your organisation depends on the scope. Common roles needed for participation are: Management, Business and IT-architects, system owners, super users, and possibly key resources of your organisation’s customers.Outcomes and conclusionHaving an efficient integration function is a key component to an organisation’s digitalisation. Properly implemented it will enable systems to be more independent and self-sustained, allowing them to focus on their core functionality. The entire enterprise architecture will be loosely coupled and flexible where systems can be interchanged. Also, information security and access control can be centrally managed and regulatory compliant. Performing an integration assessment will help your organisation to implement this function, fitting your business. It will give you insights on where you are today and how to achieve your goals in a cost-efficient manner.On a high level, the deliverables of the assessment are:A plan to improve governance, availability, security, and insight of your information exchanges.
Analysis of your current state and integration capabilities.
Definition of your future strategy, needs, and goals.
Gap analysis and roadmap to realize the target strategy.
Proposed integration function including governance and high-level architecture.
Detailed solution proposal including governance, technology(ies), integration architecture, and services.
Detailed action plan on how to get from your current state to your target functionality including cost estimates and time plan.An integration assessment is an efficient way for your organisation to have access to a specialised expert on system integration to gain valuable insights of your integration function from an outside perspective.We at Tietoevry Create would love to tell you more about this service.

"Tietoevry Tech Talks unwrapped the trends of 2023, digital sovereignty, and the future of cloud services",/en/blog/2023/03/tietoevry-tech-talks-unwrapped-the-trends-of-2023-digital-sovereignty-and-the-future-of-cloud-services/,Data / Tietoevry at your service / 30.3.2023,"Cloud is very often understood as a set of mysterious technical capabilities. All the presentations at the event proved how important it is to change the perspective of existing views that comes to digital transformation. Our socioeconomic situation has changed dramatically, and in a similar way, we need to change our perspectives when solving business challenges. Marco Mäkinen, Chief Strategy Officer at TBWA, shared the trends for 2023. He reminded us that our business challenges are outcomes of the existing socio-economic context. To predict markets and make the right decisions – to stay ahead – we need to understand the latest shifts in culture. And the cultural complexity is growing rapidly. For example, cities around the world are being reimagined for an uncertain future.At the same time, some structure to the uncertainty is coming through digital sovereignty. Wenche Karlstad, Head of Digital Sovereignty at Tietoevry, gave a presentation on the latest news from the EU (European Union) on digital sovereignty and the regulatory environment. Several proposals and regulations are pending regarding the handling of data between countries and within the use of AI (Artificial Intelligence). Tietoevry is actively taking part in the discussion in Brussels. ""We are the voice of our Nordic customers in the EU,"" said Wenche Karlstad on the stage.While cloud capabilities are only a set of tools, it is also bringing a lot of new possibilities to a faster and more innovative business and empowering cultural shifts. Markus Hongisto, Head of Google Cloud Finland, and Alberto Valero, Head of Technology and Growth, encouraged the audience to map the cloud capabilities to the right business requirements. They use the analogy of a traditional Finnish bun “korvapuusti”: Innovation supported by cloud is a little bit like Korvapuusti. We need not only to put ingredients together but also to match everything with the business requirements, and the cloud brings us ready “half-baked"" solutions ready to accelerate consumption.Markus Hongisto also reminded the audience to be bold: adapting to the cloud also means the ability to overcome challenges, allowing new ways of working and coping with uncertainty. Alberto Valero concurred and emphasized how through data and AI we can tackle rapid innovation needs.As the cherry on top, we had an interactive panel discussion with the audience. Together with the audience, our panelists were discussing when cloud transformation is successful. When can we say that? Heli Segercrantz, Country Cloud Provider Manager, Finland & Baltics, at VMWare, reminded us that while cloud is only a vehicle to boost business in a similar manner digital transformation is successful only if the end users are satisfied. When the experience is good, the transformation has also been successful. Petteri Miinalainen, CIO (Chief Information Officer) at Fennia, shared his learnings from Fennia’s extensive cloud transformation in a very regulated environment and reminded the audience to make sure that the organization is ready for the change. Leading the change is as important as the transformation process itself.Alberto Valero’s visionary statement that we really don’t know yet what’s to come with the cloud – opportunities are limitless – concluded the fruitful discussion. He reminded us that we have started to use only part of the opportunities AI and machine learning bring for future-oriented business.This is what we take with us from Tietoevry Tech Talks:We live in a constantly changing world that is shaped by trends and socio-economic changes. We can tackle rapid innovation needs with data and AI.
Cooperation in ecosystems and strong trust between customers, partners, and suppliers are essential for success.
Cloud strategies must be more than choosing a cloud platform - you must look up and focus on the needs and requirements of the business and make sure that the developers can turn those into action.
Innovation occurs in hyper-scaler cloud services, but not all data can be placed in the core public cloud data centers. It, therefore, requires bringing the cloud where the data is created and stored, driven by the right choice of partners who can deliver national solutions with global capabilities.
Digital sovereignty is not only about protecting data but also about having transparency about where and how the data is stored and under which legal control it is handled. This is important to balance security with innovation enabled by public cloud solutions.", Tietoevry at your service ,Data , 30.3.2023
Your best talent attracts the best applicants,/en/blog/2023/03/your-best-talent-attracts-the-best-applicants/,Digitalization / Viivi  Kaikkonen / 29.3.2023,"Like many other workers in the past couple of years, I have recently decided to leave my previous position and change to a new job - to Tietoevry in my case. In the United States, they are talking about The Great Resignation, Big Quit, and the Great Reshuffle. In other parts of the world and Europe workers are also willing to change their jobs more often than before. For you, as an employer, this has created and continues to create pressure on making sure your employees are happy and will want to stay in their jobs.Promote internal mobility for continuous career growthThe lack of career growth has been identified as one of the most important reasons for leaving a job. Internal career opportunities are a great way to make sure employees have a chance to develop and move forward inside the company. Workday takes the latest trends into account when they continuously develop enhancements to their HCM internal mobility features. The good-looking internal postings or easy-to-use Jobs Hub, where employees can find all the job postings and their applications, are not the main reasons for a person to stay or leave a company, but it certainly helps to boost internal mobility, and offers professional growth. It is always more appealing to apply for an internal job if it is easy to find and easy to apply for. Workday simplifies the internal application experience for example by auto-filling the applicant's contact information, experience and education information.

From factories to a network of knowledge hubs – The eternal evolution,/en/blog/2023/03/from-factories-to-a-network-of-knowledge-hubs-the-eternal-evolution/,Cloud / Vinh Quang Nguyen / 28.3.2023,"From a global perspective, the Nordic countries are well positioned for the digital transition in the coming decade, with a high skilled workforce and a society that has high adaption of technology in most aspects of daily life. Due to high production costs, the challenging macroeconomic condition, and the intensifying global competition, Industry 4.0 represents a window of opportunity for Nordic manufactures to demonstrate resilience and gain an unrivalled competitive advantage.The vision of the fourth industrial revolution is filled with promise for manufacturers, but wide-scaled digital transformation across the sector is still left unseen. Emerging technologies such as IoT, Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Cloud and Edge computing, Cobots and wearables, will have tremendous business impact. New technology compels manufacturers to reconsider their business models and value chain – which is a time-consuming process that requires significant effort to accomplish.The scalability challenge and how to tackle itIn the manufacturing world, making informed decisions on different levels of the organization has long been essential to deliver on time, maintain quality, and prevent unplanned downtime. Today, the vast quantity of data created on the production line has grown past the analogue processes and manual analysis ability to process and derive meaningful information. This is where the array of interconnected Industrial IoT technologies play a vital role in bringing factories online and providing real-time contextualized data to support rapid decision-making across various business processes.Let us take an example of how a network of connected smart factories can give companies more precision and finesse in the way they operate and help them become more productive and sustainable. Executives gain the ability to adjust production based on demand across different geographies – as seen in the pandemic, when recovery was uneven across the globe. For the operation engineer this can translate into better plans through the traceability of raw material and time spent on earlier production runs, and the visibility to live-track deviations in an on-going run.When bringing life to the vision, many mature companies go for the proven approach of starting small, in the form of a proof-of-value/concept to demonstrate the value, then rapidly scaling the solution across all plants to maximize the benefit. Starting too small or specialized when implementing the digital solution runs the risk of limiting and undercutting the potential value. Ultimately, this approach can lead to manufacturers directing the digitization effort into fitting the factory site’s uniqueness, which slows down the transformation journey.Global scalable solutions that execute locally are no mean feat. To address the challenges early, moving to a network of smart connected factories can contribute to creating a standardized solution that can cater to the nuances of each individual plant.Technical solutions are only part of the pictureAs the 21st century industrial revolution is primarily driven by technology advancement, the paradox is that a slow-paced digitizing journey can be due to a sole focus on technology itself. Companies who succeed acknowledge that the process reaches far beyond a technical concept, and that one aspect takes centre stage in the transformation: people. There's no getting around it. Conquering the digitalization journey never starts with the technology, it starts with winning the hearts and minds of the people involved. It is a process that requires a long-term commitment as well as a strong north-star and strategy spanning across the whole company.A typical key challenge when addressing the human aspect is the working culture and the discrepancy between the traditional roles in IT and in the plant. Engineers on the operational side have been taking care of the continuous operation of the factory for decades; it's in their DNA. Their daily pressure of maintaining a constantly running factory often takes precedent over spending the efforts to contribute into the company’s digitalization initiatives. On the other hand, the IT department has been on the organization’s supporting end with deep IT competency, but it does not necessarily have the experience of how a practical process runs on the shop floor, or know-how about operational technology (OT).Underestimating the time required to build mutual understanding and trust between the parties from the start can be a fatal mistake in the long run. As IT professionals will increasingly play a critical role in empowering the operation engineers and optimizing the production processes end-to-end. This is why digitalization initiatives that run in silos might lack the business perspective and involvement from the end-user needed to achieve the desired outcome. In the end, the technical solutions are only part of the picture. The new practical processes and a unified way of working will be as crucial throughout the journey.It is very natural that individuals react to a big change at first. Demystifying the approach by onboarding factory workers early on in the process goes a long way, as the diverse team will be in a better position to redesigning a process that meets the real user needs and makes the new technology work for them – and also increases the willingness to adapt when the solution is in production.The digitalization journey is a continuous learning processStaying focused and committed to the digitalization journey, even when faced with challenges and setbacks, is of utmost importance. Although the journey may, at times, feel like a jungle of endless obstacles, Rome wasn’t built in a day. The digitalization journey is a continuous learning process and digital maturity is an evolving target for all the actors involved. Success and failures, regardless of their size and magnitude, should be recognized and celebrated as milestones. Over the course of time, the progress made will amount to the revolution that once was envisioned.A qualified partner like Tietoevry provides continuous progress and tangible outcomes during your digitalization journey.

At the core, the benefits can be summarized as a lights-out factory that is highly digitized and autonomous; Smart products that are connected and self-aware; intelligent assets which are self-correcting and predictive; and empowered people – through real-time knowledge and data-driven decision support.", Vinh Quang Nguyen ,Cloud , 28.3.2023
ChatGPT and my grandfather,/en/blog/2023/03/chatgpt-and-my-grandfather/,Data / Simon Kavanagh / 24.3.2023,"Figure 1: Not actually my grandfather. Actually not anyone. Generated by Deepai.orgI’m reminded of him as I’m talking to ChatGPT on Openai.com. It seems the essence of my grandfather has been condensed and fed into this strange machine. ChatGPT also wants to tell good stories and also isn’t so worried about their veracity or accuracy. Indeed on the landing page, it admits exactly that:Figure 2: Ain’t that the truth!Still, interacting with ChatGPT is fun. I ask it to explain String Theory in language a ten-year-old would understand. It does well. I still don’t really get it, but at least I get it as much as a 10-year-old.An impossible task. What now?Then I ask it to explain Weak Electromagnetic Force in language which Shakespeare would understand. That doesn’t work out so well. Apart from a lot of doth and ’tis, the explanation isn’t very different from the language we use today, over 500 years after Shakespeare died.Of course, it’s an unfair task, as the concepts needed in any discussion of modern physics wouldn’t have been available in the late 1500s. So then why try? ChatGPT could have just said “No, that’s not possible.” and I would have been fine with that, even a little impressed at the honesty.But this is the issue with both ChatGPT and my Grandfather. They both hate answering “I don’t know”.Figure 3: Rare portrait of Shakespeare Googling modern physics (https://hotpot.ai/)Instead, in the absence of the correct answers both will not only ‘generate incorrect information’, they will generates complete rubbish.


,Instead, in the absence of the correct answers, both will not only ‘generate incorrect information’, but they will also generate complete rubbish.An easy way to test this is the field of etymology – word roots and their relations. I ask ChatGPT to show me some examples of Finnish words which are related to Hungarian words. It first dutifully tells me that these two languages are related as they are both Finno-Ugric languages. I didn’t ask that, but thanks. I guess. Then it gives me some examples of related words, like the word for garden which is kert (Hungarian) and puutarha (Finnish).This is odd as these words don’t seem related at all. So I ask ChatGPT to show me how the words are related. It then tells me: “The Hungarian word ‘kert’ comes from the Old Turkic word ‘ker’, which means ‘to enclose’ or ‘to fence in’. The Finnish word ‘puutarha’, on the other hand, comes from the Swedish word ‘botar’, which means ‘cure’ or ‘remedy’.”But that answer just makes them look even less related! So I persist. I ask ChatGPT to show me exactly the relationship between these words. ChatGPT answers: “the words themselves are not related, as they have different roots”. I make a facepalm emoji, with my face and my palm.So, what is ChatGPT?
It doesn’t really seem to know itself. It’s kind of like a search engine, kind of like a chatbot, kind of like an encyclopedia. But under the hood, it’s a text prediction engine with some fancy lossy compression. It doesn’t understand anything about the concepts it is talking about. That is really important to understand.
ChatGPT identifies patterns but has no idea what the patterns mean. In overly-simple terms, when you ask ChatGPT a question it tries to answer something which matches the pattern of your question. It wants to satisfy you and the pattern of your question. ChatGPT is ALL about satisfying you. And this is why it very rarely says “I don’t know”.This is a problem?Well, there is an ethical question about how much responsibility ChatGPT has for the answers it gives.How can you know what is made up and what is based on real learning? And does ChatGPT itself even know the difference between the two?Then there are the issues of bias and veracity. I ask ChatGPT how it handles questions of bias in its training data and how it ensures the veracity of its answers. ChatGPT expresses its views around ethics and responsibility and they are well articulated but complete nonsense. It first says: “As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to make moral or ethical judgments”.OK, but does that means ChatGPT considers itself free of any ethical responsibility? “No, I am programmed to comply with ethical standards”.So how exactly does it manage to be compliant with ethical standards when it can not make ethical judgements?


,This answer comes very quickly:Figure 4: Well played ChatGPT, well played.It is obvious when interacting with ChatGPT, and when reading about it on OpenAI’s webpage, that its creators believe it will have a positive impact. Of course. You need to believe that what you create is positive, otherwise, no reasonable person would create it. But hubris can lead to blind trust and when that happens you miss potential risks, or maybe you stop caring about them.The sad reality of human nature is that if a technology can be misused then it will be. How will ChatGPT be misused? All sorts of fantastic ways. Whatever ChatGPT is today, with all its potential benefits and even with its current limitations, it’s not going to be this way in 3 years’ time. If ChatGPT can be successfully monetized (and make no mistake, that’s the only thing that counts) then it’s going to become so pervasive we won’t even notice we’re using it.The same can be said for image generation AIs like Dall-E or music generation like MuseNet (both from OpenAI, by the way). Having that technology everywhere isn’t necessarily a bad thing but if we don’t get the ethics right today then we’re sleepwalking into all sorts of risks.And that’s surely something we should try to avoid. Right?

,I like to think my grandfather knew when he was stretching the truth. And I’m fairly sure his captive audience did too. But ChatGPT doesn’t know when it’s lying and takes no responsibility for spitting lies anyhow. The consequences of this right now are not so serious. ChatGPT is a toy. It’s funny when it lies, maybe a little frustrating when it argues with you. But what about the scenario where ChatGPT is baked into loads of our online interactions? How funny will it be then?UPDATE: In an interview with ABC News on March 16th, 2023 the CEO of OpenAI admitted that we are right to be scared about this technology as it comes with real dangers and the impact on society is still unknown.

Sami Alitalo: A software developer shining in the cloud,/en/blog/2023/03/sami-alitalo/,Meet our people / Sami Alitalo / 20.3.2023,"“After hanging up, my supervisor asked if I could immediately start working as a cloud expert on an important SaaS service sales proposal for a top-ten corporation in Finland. It sounded challenging but I didn’t hesitate to jump on board that moving train,” Sami Alitalo recollects fondly.As he began to work on the long requirement lists, plan service architecture and calculate costs and work estimations, he felt no pressure from the huge team involved, only support. He even attended the final proposal presentation and answered customer questions.“From almost the first day, I had a feeling of belonging. We completed the proposal by the deadline and won the case. It was an eye-opening experience.”Always something new in the cloudSince boarding that train, Sami has discovered that life as a software developer rarely means travelling the same route and it’s that variety that keeps him mentally engaged.“A regular workday starts with a quick team meeting to check the situation of our current projects but then it’s rare for anything else to go as planned. Working with both sales cases and software deliveries in the Microsoft Azure environment means there are different issues to problem solve daily.”His current project is a ‘clean table’, so the Software Engineering team are setting up everything in the development pipeline, from basic coding and infrastructure to solving communication problems overlooked by contractors who created the environments.With each new cloud-native project, Sami always applies the best of himself, be it public, corporate or private.“For example, there was a small delivery project that involved modernising an old Java system. I’m more of a C#, JavaScript and Microsoft .NET guy—Java is not my forte. But the responsibility fell to me because I was the only one who knew how to code it. It was intense and difficult, but the customer was happy.”Advancing software developer skillsWith advancements in cloud-native development arriving every 4-6 months, Sami is keen to remain versatile and keep his mind open as he navigates an ever-changing environment.“During the year, I try to read at least a couple of technology-related books and use Tietoevry’s Pluralsight and Udemy subscriptions. Tietoevry also has a free programme that supports its employees to attain official certification in different fields during their workday.”Since joining Create, Sami kept his professional skills in good shape by passing the DevOps Engineer Expert and Azure Developer Associate courses, both of which were Microsoft certified.Supported across the company, training is recognised as a way for its employees to not only improve themselves but to also learn how to develop more efficient applications and how to deliver them.Combined with the desire for self-improvement is the opportunity to share what he has learned. Throughout the year, the team also organise training sessions about AI or something they may have faced in their daily work and occasionally welcome external experts.“Immediate feedback after a presentation is rare, but the proof that everybody was awake and listening can be seen in its application in projects or discussions across Microsoft Teams.”Harness the potential of cloudSince cloud computing is enhancing the ability to work anywhere, it is natural to discover that the Tietoevry “creators” are spread across Finland including Helsinki, Jyväskylä, Oulu, and many more.“For us, the pandemic has made using Teams as easy as walking up to somebody’s desk. We can effortlessly ask for help and ideas even though we are in separate locations. We have a supportive team and we are always free to participate in proposals, like the one from my first day on the job.”Cloud computing is also increasingly going hand in hand with AI. Not only will it handle the bulk of coding and enable more automation but will give software developers like Sami more time to focus on the bigger problems.“Over the next decade, cloud development will be increasingly adopted across the board and Tietoevry Create has the potential to be an even bigger player than we are now. It’s a new frontier.”Ready to accelerate digital innovation?

How do we smartly build a value-creating customer portal?,/en/blog/2023/03/how-do-we-smartly-build-a-value-creating-customer-portal/,Digitalization / Jonas Prosell / 14.3.2023,"In a post-pandemic world, it is necessary to be present in the digital channels where customers expect to meet and trade with their suppliers. But customers still want to be able to ask for advice from a person if necessary. This means that we need to tailor to both personal and digital touchpoints. The customer journey needs to be coherent and allow the customer to switch between modes of interaction without losing any information along the way. Fast-growing companies succeed in creating value for customers by combining in-person contacts with digital interactions. Make sure you understand that journey, and­­­­­­­­­­­­­ build the customer portal based on your customer’s needs.The B2B companies we meet often start by offering their customers what is most necessary. And that is not entirely wrong. Launching the first version of your portal to get quickly on track is a very clever idea. Once established, you need to learn fast about what would improve your customers' journey and develop the right functionality and experience based on your findings. Internal digital maturity often needs to evolve simultaneously, building competence and capacity within the selling company to drive digital development forward at the necessary speed.We find that a natural development curve with B2B sellers can be described by the following steps:Create basic functionalityCreate cost-effective solutions that generate immediate value for the customer through simple self-service functions such as order history, access to documents, invoices, etc. ­­­­Both to meet customer needs and to streamline the work and cooperation within the selling company.
Offer purchases from the standard product portfolio via the webshop. ­­­­
Set goals, and follow up the results through measurement, analysis, and tests. Start building experience and competence in basing your best practices on data-driven insights.Add value and expand the offerAdd more complex self-service functionality.
Create a unique and cohesive experience across platforms.
Offer added value linked to already purchased products such as service alerts, service scheduling, optimization of output & performance, upgrades, digital ­­­guides, or digital training.
Enable purchasing of more complex configurable, or customized products.
Create tools that can support the sales force to achieve better sales efficiency. In this way, in-person sales relate to your digital commerce and will contribute to increased sales efficiency and a coherent experience.

Develop the business model. Create new revenue streams and services through digital commerce.Think MVPIndeed, there are companies that ""skip"" steps and directly aim higher already from the start. Formulating a long-term vision for what you want to achieve with your digital commerce is an excellent idea. However, our experience is that you do not have to do everything at once. Instead, choosing a point of departure where you create real impact is important. What do your customers need? And what improves your business? Identify what you need to build and what needs to be included in the solution, but no more than that. Prioritize away everything that is not necessary. We call it an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). ­­­­­­Technology is an enabler, and there are several possible paths to explore, but be sure to build in a way that makes you flexible and allow you to adapt solution over time. No matter where you stand in your development curve, you must make constant choices, depart from the current situation, and create and maintain a great roadmap. We propose a structured approach, where we work with continuous improvements based on data. ­Never ­­settle down­; ensure that there is a continued will and drive to develop your digital value along with your customers ­to create continued competitiveness.In the next part, I will write about how customer portals can improve your sales efficiency.Read part 1/5 in my blog series: Why customer portal is hotter than ever.Read part 2/5 in my blog series: The right functionality for value creation.Read part 4/5 in my blog series: The customer portal contributes to internal efficiency.Read part 5/5 in my blog series: Digital Commerce serves as an icebreaker för digital transformation", Jonas Prosell ,Digitalization , 14.3.2023
How to develop ethical technology,/en/blog/2023/03/how-to-develop-ethical-technology/,Digitalization / Simon Kavanagh / 13.3.2023,"In the coming weeks, we will publish a series of blog posts exploring this topic. In this first post, we will give you some tips and tricks on how to bring ethics into your development team.The problems we have to solve in the tech industry are often very complex. That’s why this industry attracts so many talented engineers, designers and business developers. Tough challenges are fun to solve! So, how can we leverage the talent of team members to tackle the ethical challenges of the product or solution we’re developing?Well, while there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach, there are some really fundamental questions that each team could start by addressing.1.What is it we are developing?Take a step back from all the technical, user and business perspectives for a while and focus on the value the solution is intended to provide and for whom. Does it bring us closer to achieving any of the UN Sustainable Development Goals? Will it improve society? Are the intentions morally positive, negative or neutral?A solution to empower elderly people to live more independently has morally positive intentions; a solution to create audio deepfakes to commit fraud has morally negative intentions. This question is not about how the solution is developed or how it could be misused (they are addressed in other questions). Instead, it’s about what the solution itself is intended to do and how ethical that is.While answering this question, it might be useful to consult experts who are not working directly in the tech industry. Moral philosophers, human rights experts and environmental scientists might have insights your team could benefit from. Reach out to them!2.Who are we?The 2018 video game Assassins Creed: Odyssey has a starting screen which proudly tells the user that it was developed by a “…multicultural team of various beliefs, sexual orientations and gender identities”. This team decided that if they were to build an inclusive experience they needed to be an inclusive team.The second ethical question is therefore about understanding your team. Who are you, what are your team biases, how can these biases influence the direction of the solution and how can you counteract them? It is rarely a bad idea to involve real users in the development of a product and this is a great way to uncover bias in your team. Which all leads to the next question…3.Who are our users?How will your users’ lives change as a result of your solution and how can you make sure the change is positive? Well, firstly you need to understand them. This is a fundamental principle in Design Thinking and, thankfully, not a new concept in software development. It’s about building empathy with real users and bringing them into the development process. It’s about accessibility, inclusion and understanding the impact your solution will have on real people.4. What could possibly go wrong?Even with the best of intentions, how might your solution be misused? What are the consequences of this misuse and, most importantly, what can you do in the development of your solution to prevent that misuse? Take Anonymous Messaging, for example. If you take the time to consider it, then cyberbullying might well pop up as an unintended consequence. So, as a team, you ask yourselves, ‘what can be done to prevent this being used as a bullying tool?’Through answering the above questions, you have created your own Ethical Declaration. This declaration is something which every team member should be familiar with. Some teams print theirs out and pin it to the wall. It colours the direction of the project and is something which becomes a living artefact, constantly updated and adjusted as the project progresses. The continuous adjustment is crucial. For each big step the project takes, for example for each large set of features it implements, the team has to consider how this impacts the Ethical Declaration and vice versa.The same process of assessing what is being built is also useful for customers. The customers might not understand the impact of what they are ordering and the ways in which the solution could be misused. Therefore, the creation of the Ethics Declaration is as much of an eye-opening experience for customers as it is for the team building the solutions. Our experience working with these questions is that inviting the customer into the process together with the development team is very rewarding.There will always be mistakes and there will always be teams that, for one reason or another, set the ethical bar too low. However, by bringing ethics to the forefront it’s much harder to accidentally create something unethical.Good luck!", Simon Kavanagh ,Digitalization , 13.3.2023
Why assessing maturity is important when outsourcing cybersecurity,/en/blog/2023/03/why-assessing-maturity-is-important-when-outsourcing-cybersecurity/,Cybersecurity insights / Maria Nordgren / 13.3.2023,"This maturity level varies significantly between industries, organizations and individuals. One size does not fit all.If an organization has a high maturity level, well-established security infrastructure and adequate in-house security knowledge, then it’s much more capable of impactful outsourcing that optimally addresses security needs.Assessing the maturity of an organization is thus essential when outsourcing cybersecurity services, as it affects the level of support and guidance needed from the service provider. Maturity impacts decision-making and the overall cost of services.Defining and raising the levelHow can an organization know what maturity level it should reach? And what does the defined level imply?Many security consultants can provide objective answers to these questions. They use a methodological and systematic approach – along with verified metering – to define the appropriate maturity level for a customer.The process may not be called a maturity analysis, but rather an overall business-risk analysis that looks at the business, its environment, and potential security risks and gaps. Most likely the result is that the current level is lower than it should be, so the next phase is to start a program that takes it to a new level.For the sake of simplicity, the maturity of security can be rated on a scale of 1 to 5. A plumbing company may be on level 1, for example, but a large hospital must get to at least level 3. An organization classified as a critical-infrastructure operator should reach level 5.The higher the organization's target level is, the higher the level individual employees must reach too. A lack of skills dilutes the value of any security investment, so when outsourcing security it’s vital to ensure that end users are on board. With sufficient training, people's skills and individual awareness will improve, which will ultimately help an organization to succeed in its outsourcing.Outsource to close the gapA significant gap between the required maturity level and the existing situation leaves opportunities for cybercriminals. If an organization finds itself immature and lacking internal resources, it must find a way out.Outsourcing is a great way to close this gap. With outsourced security an organization can rapidly and cost-effectively achieve a much higher level of maturity.A service partner brings in top-notch security expertise to analyze the customer's environment, and deploy best-of-breed solutions and support that match the customer's needs. This enables an organization to reach the right level of cybersecurity maturity in weeks or months, rather than in years or decades.Below you can find a whitepaper on outsourcing security, which is intended to be used as a comprehensive guide. I hope that you'll find it useful. Don't hesitate to contact me or any of my colleagues if you have any questions about cyber security!", Maria Nordgren ,Cybersecurity insights , 13.3.2023
Edge Computing’s Role in Digital Transformation,/en/blog/2023/03/iot-enables-digital-transformation/,Digitalization / Michal Ptacek / 7.3.2023,"According to several studies (*1) edge computing will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.6% between 2022 and 2028 to hit an estimated $156 billions by 2030. There are multiple factors behind that growth, one of them is the advancing of 5G/6G, which is enabling the establishment of new telco AI & IoT usecases. IoT is perceived as a key enabler for digital transformation and it's adding improvements in enterprise efficiencies. Tietoevry´s mission is to help our customers and partners with such digital transformation.In Barcelona MWC2023 we demonstrated our edge computing usecase, which is showing Tietoevry capabilities in cloud edge computing domain. Together with our partners from Intel and Advantech we brought our Scalable Edge computing platform usecase (*2) into 2023 using newer version of all involved HW & SW components. Our usecase is demonstrating containerized Automatic Pedestrian Alert System (APAS) application, but in general any other edge usecase can be considered for such scalable edge platform solution. APAS application is designed to alert drivers about pedestrians potentially crossing the roads, which is especially crucial in difficult driving conditions or multi-lane support. This usecase was successfully presented in City of Tampere in 2019. (*3)APAS application was onboarded on Intel Smart Edge Open (formerly known as OpenNESS), as it exposes Intel hardware features to the Kubernetes based containerized Edge environment and enables easy deployment and optimized orchestration of various usecases starting from media analytics through Content Delivery Network (CDN) up to 5G access and core network functions.PlatformHW Platform used in this case is based on Advantech SKY-8132S (*4), which is a compact 1U edge server based on 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors. For the scaling scenario we are using also Advantech VEGA-3500 (*5), which is Intel 11th Gen CPU-based UHD video accelerator card.Similar benchmarking was done during 2021 on top of following HW & SW stack.BenchmarkingWe have used the same key performance indicators as in 2021. Our goal is to demonstrate how many different camera streams can be processed on single low/mid cost edge platform and how the capabilities of such edge platforms are evolving over time. We have also used the same 3fps input camera streams and Intel OpenVINO pretrained object detection (*6) with SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) deep learning model and FP16 precision. Focus areas are zebra crossings and crossroads are reframed to 512x512 pixels for inference processing. The idea is to keep the test environment as close to the original benchmarking, which was done in 2021 but use newer HW & SW stack to visualize the progress.Based on that criteria we have performed a range of tests and focused on 3 main scenarios:to indicate how many parallel camera streams we can run on SKY-8132S and compare it with our previous results from SKY-8101.
to indicate how many parallel camera streams we can run on VEGA-3500, which is PCIe UHD card and compare it it older but VPU specialized VEGA-340 used during 2021 benchmarking.
to indicate how many parallel camera streams we can run on whole platform using combined computing power of SKY-8132S CPU and VEGA-3500 card and compare this with previously tested Scalable edge platform from 2021 benchmarking.We have collected following data, which is very good and in some extent better than what we expected. Average inference is on acceptable level and it indicates that so many camera streams can be processed. However there were some peaks detected, where inference took much longer than what is acceptable. It occured on VEGA-3500, where we hit also memory limitation (VEGA-3500 has own RAM memory 2x 16GB) and there was some disc swapping happening. We believe that this can be further optimized in APAS code for instance by having a dedicated container for OpenVINO processing instead of having multiple dedicated container for each camera stream. Our team is already now working on how to optimize this further.Minimal inference

Both host CPU and VEGA-3500SummaryWe successfully demonstrated significant improvements when compared 2nd Gen Intel Xeon CPU with it’s successor from 3rd Gen Intel Xeon CPU family. Newer VEGA-3500 card is also bringing significant boost to scaling capabilities of such edge platform. VEGA-3500 provides a independent computing unit with dedicated RAM, CPU and OS. So benchmarking executed on VEGA-3500 did not impact results on underlying host tests, which was not the case during 2021 tests with VEGA-340. VEGA-3500 provides even better scaling options as several such cards can be inserted into SKY-8000 Advantech platforms.Edge computing is an important area for Tietoevry, so further improvements on this usecase is planned, as well as other exciting usecases and research work. So more updates will follow, so stay tuned.Sources:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/09/27/2523687/0/en/Edge-Computing-Market-Forecast-to-2028-COVID-19-Impact-and-Global-Analysis-By-Component-Organization-Size-Application-and-Industry.html

The Virtues of Virtual Accounts,/en/blog/2023/03/the-virtues-of-virtual-accounts/,Digitalization / Alexandra Larsen / 6.3.2023,"The challenges that treasurers face have not changed much over the years and include:Improving bank account management
Improving bank account reconciliation
More accurate and reliable cash forecasting
Better management of inter-company transactions
Centralising treasury
Centralising payments and collections
Monitoring and managing cash visibility throughout the organisationHowever, the methods of tackling these challenges have changed. The good news is that virtual accounts can help with these and other issues. The following explains how.The power of virtual accounts is that they offer businesses the ability to streamline their bank account structures enabling real end-to-end solutions that are flexible, accessible, and easily integrated with existing systems. They also help facilitate better insight into payments, receivables, and liquidity by providing a detailed view of activities. They do this by concentrating all activity into a single physical account linked by virtual accounts. This then enables reconciliation of transactions at a granular level if required, for example by entity, currency, or client.Virtual accounts take the traditional account structure to a new level. A virtual account management solution enables immediate liquidity concentration, eliminating the need for physical cash sweep structures. This in turn reduces costs. To illustrate this some banks have indicated that their clients have been able to reduce their physical accounts by as much as 50%.In addition, virtual accounts enable the segregation of activity under a single, centralised physical bank account, while retaining visibility and reporting required to manage reconciliation and accounting.Moving from physical to virtual accounts has other benefits including a reduction in the number of accounts that need to be confirmed for audit purposes. In addition, virtual accounts offer greater control of bank account management so that corporates can open, close, or modify as many virtual accounts as needed organising account structures with greater flexibility and without the need for heavy KYC documentation. Placing bank account management in the hands of treasury and with limited involvement from banks is something corporates could only dream of in years gone by.Virtual accounts offer flexible structures that can be adapted and changed as organisations change. For companies that are acquisitive and require structural changes to their treasury, virtual accounts can be added quickly ensuring that the new entity is contributing to the treasury strategy in as short a time as possible.Reducing the numbers of bank accounts not only reduces banking costs but also simplifies administration and in turn reduces risk management.If there is need for greater visibility and control at an operating account level for a regional treasury, then a virtual account structure is the ideal way to manage this.A virtual account management solution can also seamlessly integrate with a client’s current global platforms which will help with payables and receivables and in particular reconciliation of both and in addition reduce the need for multiple bank accounts per currency. Indeed, speaking of multiple currencies some banks offer virtual account solutions which are multi-bank and offer multi-currency cash visibility. This means that corporates can gain a complete overview of all payments, collections, and cash across their complete banking networks in near real-time including across all their currencies.Finally, intercompany accounts, users can configure their own virtual account hierarchy themselves, at any level, in lie with their business needs. So, this makes it possible to construct intercompany positions including setting of intercompany interest rates, position alerts etc. This can all be controlled by dashboards, tailor made to the client’s requirements.The above describes only some of the power of virtual accounts and what they can do to address the demands of corporate treasury clients.For more information visit: Cash Management SolutionsGet in touch with us to discuss further: payments@tietoevry.com", Alexandra Larsen ,Digitalization , 6.3.2023
How data is helping solve the biggest environmental challenges,/en/blog/2023/03/how-data-is-helping-solve-the-biggest-environmental-challenges/,Sustainability / Data  Insiders / 1.3.2023,"Before joining Vaisala, Teppo Kuisma spent several years in Silicon Valley. He has vast experience in data-driven services and business models from established companies, tech startups, and consultancies. In this Data Insiders episode, Kuisma shares learnings from Vaisala Xweather’s experience building enormous data assets and sophisticated machine-learning models that are set to fight climate change and other environmental issues.“Vaisala Xweather is everything we do on a subscription model. It is a new way for us to engage with our clients,” Kuisma explains.Weather forecasting, which we are all familiar with as consumers, is sophisticated data science in itself. But Xweather is taking it to the next level to provide actionable insights to a range of industries from automotive to renewable energy to agriculture.“We operate a global lightning detection network that catches nearly every lightning flash worldwide. We also provide a road weather forecast every 15 minutes for every stretch of road in the western world.”With renewable energy set to overtake coal as the world's largest electricity source, weather has become very important in terms of achieving a sustainable society. Forecasting solar radiation and wind is crucial to energy producers and is one of the key use cases for Xweather environmental data.Historical weather data has valuable practical uses too. For example, it helps insurance companies find out when and where lightning strikes occurred in order to assess claims for damages. Or what the road conditions were leading up to an accident claimed to have been caused by aquaplaning.Solving the environmentTeppo Kuisma splits the use cases for Xweather into three categories – optimization, protection, and measuring the impact – and gives a few tangible examples.You can reduce carbon emissions by finding an optimal route for long-distance trucks by avoiding the weather fronts on the way. Protection applies to safeguarding assets like data centers or power grid lines from thunderstorms and other severe weather events. Measuring and forecasting the impact on air quality can be used to optimize operations in mines and construction sites, and to manage traffic in large cities.According to Kuisma, Vaisala Xweather helps thousands of businesses to address global environmental problems in hundreds of different ways.And they are not limited to just this planet; the same sensor technologies that are used in Vaisala devices are on NASA’s Perseverence rover that was sent to Mars in 2020.Working with the most demanding clients pushes the Xweather team to build innovative solutions, Kuisma tells:“When we deliver weather forecasts via enterprise APIs to human-machine interfaces such as the BMW dashboard, we need to work closely together with the clients. Your car is a different media compared to your cell phone, as it’s sometimes offline for a little while before it comes back again. Still, you want the weather forecast to be up to date.”Three maturity levels of data-driven business modelsIn addition to demanding clients that continuously challenge the Vaisala Xweather team, one of its success factors is years of open collaboration with the large developer audience, and Vaisala’s heritage of investing heavily in R&D.“There is a particular Vaisala culture. We have always pushed ourselves to be the best in the world in our industry.”Teppo Kuisma encourages enterprises in the Nordics that are building new data-driven business models to separate the emerging business unit or team from the core discipline, for example, placing them in a new office. Concrete actions like these force the teams into new thinking. This was also Vaisala’s approach when it started Xweather, Kuisma reminds us.For those at the beginning of their data-driven journey, Teppo Kuisma points out that huge value can be created on top of existing structures and by learning to use the data that is already there. Kuisma gives examples of three maturity levels in the context of Xweather’s client BMW.The first level is to layer data on top of your product, for example by providing air quality data on a dashboard. The second level is to use data to make the product act differently.“If the car is automatically switching from combustion engine to electrical drive whenever there is a kindergarten or hospital nearby, it creates a totally different driver experience.”The third level is enhancing your product or service by teaching it with the data, using machine learning and AI capabilities, for example, autonomous and assisted driving.At the end of the discussion, Teppo Kuisma highlights the most important thing: there is a lot of data that we are not using yet, and if our goals are ambitious, such as Xweather’s vision to “solve the environment”, we can’t just expect the things to work in the old way.“Have a high ambition to use the data that is available, because it is there. And keep your bar high!”Data Insiders - stay in the knowStay ahead of the data revolution with Data Insiders, the #1 Data Podcast!

Maarit Paananen: Problem-solver and coach to the max,/en/blog/2023/02/maarit-paananen/,Meet our people / Maarit Paananen / 20.2.2023,"This citation is from Maarit Paananen’s LinkedIn profile. It nicely grabs her attitude towards work – solving problems rapidly so that others can do their work.Maarit, the current Head of Data at Tietoevry Create, worked as a logistics coordinator at a global distribution center at Nokia Networks in 2000. She was responsible for inbound and outbound deliveries of base stations.“If there was a problem with our ERP or reporting system, I had to tackle it quickly so that the trucks would leave in time. Otherwise, there would have been a delay of up to 24 hours causing extra costs for the company. I learned the meaning of the quality of data, how to negotiate and handle stress and time,” highlights Maarit in one of her many stories.Long gone are the days of internal checks at the country borders in Europe before Schengen.The job connected Maarit with Tietoevry, the partner in IT systems. At that time, the company was called TietoEnator as Finnish Tieto merged with Swedish Enator.Tietoevry had noted that the number of tickets had diminished thanks to Maarit’s efforts. She had also started to make some fixes to the systems herself. Then, Tietoevry offered the problem-solver a consulting job in Finland.“What does the customer need?”Maarit has stayed with Tietoevry for over 20 years, but her role has changed frequently. She has always been internally headhunted for a new position. Maarit has, for instance, worked as a Consultant, Service Manager, and Head of Business Intelligence & Analytics before becoming the Head of Data at Tietoevry Create. It is the leading digital accelerator for innovation and sustainable value creation. The practice combines business design with software engineering to bring digital business to life.Whatever Maarit has done she has always boosted growth and worked with data. Once Maarit was the only consultant working for a customer, but soon the team consisted of seven people. She brought out new service suggestions to the customer.“This is our way to do business also these days. The consultant starts to work on the assignment, builds trust by achieving results, and figures out new things to be developed. It culminates in helping the customer in the best way with data management models, modernization of data and analytics landscapes, enterprise performance management, integrations, or other things,” says Maarit.She adds that customers can have small teams and thus need external consultants, “creators”, to advise on data issues and run development projects. It means new learning opportunities.Nurturing talentBut what does boosting growth mean to Maarit these days? The list includes customer cooperation, pre-sales, recruiting talent, and supporting employees. In the data world, Maarit is known as a leader, who hires also junior IT professionals and coaches them.“I am glad that many have reached management positions over the years,” says Maarit. One can sense that she is proud of them.Maarit believes that her key job is to show direction and support people. When an employee wants to talk, she is available with quick notice.“I am there to listen to my employees and ask questions to get forward. People must feel that they are not left alone.”On the other hand, she expects open interaction from her employees.“We also celebrate small successes and certifications daily in our chat. It is also great to meet people face-to-face,” says Maarit.Creators work a lot remotely, but also have a chance to go to the office in many cities. During the interview week, Maarit visited the Tietoevry offices in Espoo, Joensuu, Kuopio, and Tampere.The final questionOne final question remains – how can a candidate get to work in Maarit’s team and at Tietoevry Create? Does one have to have a degree in IT like Maarit herself? She herself is a Bachelor of Engineering, Information technology from Savonia University of Applied Sciences.“No, the background and education do not matter, it is all about an interest in data and understanding dependencies, common sense, and problem-solving and decision-making skills. The rest you can learn on the job.”Her recruits include people from various education levels and backgrounds such as engineering, business and social sciences.""Just send me a message on LinkedIn and we´ll take it from there.""Get to know Maarit PaananenName: Maarit Paananen

The importance of carefully selecting the right functionality for value creation when building the customer portal,/en/blog/2023/01/the-importance-of-carefully-selecting-the-right-functionality-for-value-creation-when-building-the-customer-portal/,Digitalization / Jonas Prosell / 16.2.2023,"Long-term value in B2B customer relationshipsIt is an established truth that retaining a customer through excellent delivery and great service costs less than acquiring a new customer. Since customer relationships are often long-term and have a high lifetime value, taking good care of your customers is a very reasonable prioritization. By building customer portals with carefully selected content and functionality, suppliers can create great opportunities to meet and surpass high customer expectations and develop valuable relationships over time.Investments with suppliers are often significant in B2B, and the buyer needs to get a return. So, what creates value for the buyer? Since the value arises throughout the product's entire lifespan, it is important to optimize the value of the investment from the purchase onward. This applies to the customer's perception of the value created and the concretely added value.Through the customer portal, we can collect data about the customer's engagement, learn what they are interested in, and how they use their products. With that knowledge as a base, we can build an experience that provides a higher value for the customer.Value-creating content and functionalityA smooth path should lead the customer into the portal, as the customer portal is a part of the customer’s digital buying journey. That journey is paved by digital marketing, web content, and other customer-facing touchpoints. It should lead through to the gates of the portal in a smooth flow. That experience should provide the perception that becoming a customer is easy and desirable. Once the gates to the portal are opened, the customer portal is a tool for taking care of returning customers. It offers a logged-in and secure space for content and services.The customer portal creates engagement with the customer throughout the customer's relationship with the selling company. It also meets the professional customer's needs by providing self-service, making recurring orders easier for the customer, finding related products, and making new purchases. In addition, added value is offered, which allows the customer to get even more benefits from their product. A logged-in customer usually encounters three main categories of functionality. These are:Self-service functionality Includes everything from providing access to an overview of engagement, history, information, and documents to different transactions.
 Added value Features that optimize or increase the value of the product or service that has been purchased.
Ability to shop for products and services Customers can buy standard or customized products and easily find spare parts, kits, or consumables for the already purchased machine, tool, or equipment. In addition, there is the possibility of repurchasing, acquiring related products or services, and upgrading and carrying out the next purchase to expand capacity or replace an older product.Creating new layers of value-creating functionality in a customer portalIn addition to the basic level with self-service, spare parts, and documents, we can create different types of monitoring, service alerts, reports, training modules, production planning tools, and more, which give the buying customer a higher value of their investment. We can thus create more satisfied customers by maximizing the benefit and return on investment. This is done by helping the customer optimize the utilization or extend the product's life. In addition, the thresholds against competitors are raised when we create digital value for our customers.The customer portal also enables additional cross- and up sales. When we collect digital information about the customer's products and use of products, we can offer accessories for the customer's product, complements, service packages, consumables, subscriptions, and upgrades in the customer portal, and we can sometimes even predict the next investment or major purchase.Through the customer portal, we thus create a basis for data-driven decisions, allowing us to trim the digital sales process. That information can be truly beneficial to your in-person sales efforts as well.The customer portal contributes to profitability through improved customer satisfaction, sales, and streamlining of processes. Which functionality is most important, and in what order should you build these functions should be based on your customers' needs and your business goals.In the next part of this blog series, I will focus more on how to find a smart way forward to build a value-creating customer portal.Read part 1/5 in my blog series: Why customer portal is hotter than ever.Read part 3/5 in my blog series: How do we smartly build a customer portal.Read part 4/5 in my blog series: The customer portal contributes to internal efficiency.Read part 5/5 in my blog series: Digital Commerce serves as an icebreaker för digital transformation", Jonas Prosell ,Digitalization , 16.2.2023
Leading companies creating ecosystems aimed at new business,/en/blog/2023/02/veturi-solutions-to-future-challenges/,Digitalization / Karin Wikman / 16.2.2023,"One of the Government Programme’s goals is to increase Finland’s R&D investments to four percent of gross national product by 2030. Business Finland is for its part helping to reach this goal through the challenge competitions for leading companies, launched in 2020. The aim of the competitions is to make large companies increase their RDI investments significantly in Finland and create new high-value business ecosystems that can solve significant future challenges.The main selection criteria for the leading companies are the amount of R&D investment increase and the challenge to be solved with the ecosystem. Currently there are twelve announced leading companies and two smaller challenger class companies. The companies are committed to increasing their cumulative RDI investments in Finland by more than 1.2 billion euro!Project funding for leading companies is tied up to pre-defined goals for R&D and business growth, as well as how the ecosystem will be built – for example which partners the company gathers and what kinds of ecosystem projects it helps to start. Separate funding has been reserved for the ecosystem partner projects.Ecosystem projects relate to the subjects defined in leading companies' roadmaps. A roadmap describes the leading company’s view on how the big future challenge will be solved together and what kind of know-how and ecosystem projects the company seeks. The projects can be joint projects between companies and research organizations, projects between companies, companies’ own projects or research projects.Support for internationalization effortsThe leading company offers ecosystem partner companies a channel for market insight and projects for which the partner companies’ own resources would not necessarily be sufficient, and they get involved in solving a significant future challenge. The companies can also apply for funding from Business Finland for their own development work and get significant additional benefit from Business Finland’s extensive national and international expert network.Tietoevry Trusted Digital SocietiesTietoevry is committed to helping Finnish IT companies build globally scalable business value from responsible data-enabled platforms in these important sectors: the banking sector, the health and care sector, and energy systems in cities.

Harnessing data for effective health care,/en/blog/2023/02/harnessing-data-for-effective-health-care/,Cloud / Francisco Romero Gotor  / 16.2.2023,"On the other hand, digital technologies offer more opportunities for preventive healthcare and self-care for patients, so fewer patients need medical consultation. If used correctly, smart technology can provide health care entities with the tools to reduce costs, improve accessibility and treatment outcomes, boost patient satisfaction, and prevent individual public health risks. However, progress will need to be made in efficiently and securely exploiting the existing data.More health data is available than ever before, and the volume of data is constantly growing as health care services switch to digital technologies. However, this data is not yet utilised optimally for patient-specific treatment.There is so much data that carers simply do not have the resources to analyse it all. However, machines can do things that humans cannot. Artificial intelligence can combine and analyse patient-specific data and helps identify any red flags in time.For example, the patient information systems on the public health care sector often already show all the information for a specific patient. However, it still lacks conclusions and patient-specific steering on the basis of the existing data. More effective use of data can promote early diagnosis and preventive support for the individual’s health. Society has the potential to save huge amounts of resources if it can transition from reactive health care towards a proactive approach.Patient safety firstPatient data is currently dispersed across multiple environments, making it difficult to use the available data to its full potential and combine it to help make relevant decisions. Furthermore, the sensitive and critical nature of the data processed in health care and the constant evolution of regulatory measures call for a deep understanding of the type of data being processed and the ways of managing it to ensure patient safety, even under abnormal circumstances.Smart technologies alone are not enough; changes in infrastructure and ecosystems are also required.The health care sector operators now have a great opportunity to develop these matters. Patients must be able to trust that their personal data will not be disclosed to third parties under any circumstances. It is also important to ensure that health care professionals have enough information to treat their patients in case of a system failure. This demands an understanding of what data is critical for patient safety and how it should be protected and tested to ensure the operations are resilient and patients are safe, even in the worst-case scenario.Trust through transparencyTietoevry’s solutions based on open data promote health care innovation and service effectiveness. Multi-cloud services allow data to be used securely and located in a public or sovereign cloud, depending on the criticality of the data.We help our customers to classify data, protect information and restrict access as required according to the type of data. At the same time, our hybrid cloud services enable data integration in a way that ensures integrity and immediate availability with best-in-class data protection. Our solutions enable our customers to communicate transparently and reliably with patients, leading to a lower threshold for disclosing health data to organisations.Learn more about digital sovereignty here and hear us talk about the subject in-depth with customers and partners on Tietoevry’s Tech Talks 7th March, 2023 in Finland.Author, Mari Korhonen", Francisco Romero Gotor  ,Cloud , 16.2.2023
Open RAN integration challenges now and into the future,/en/blog/2023/02/open-ran-integration-challenges-now-and-into-the-future/,Data / Mats  Eriksson / 9.2.2023,"Open RAN is gaining more momentum and the integration challenges are being increasingly identified as a critical enabler for the future. This topic was covered by our presentation at the “with Open RAN towards 6G” webinar hosted by Rimedo Labs and Intellify also featuring Rüdiger Kuntze from Deutsche Telekom and Simon Pryor from Acceleran alongside Marcin Dryjanski and Adrian Kliks from Rimedo Labs and myself. The recording of the integration presentation is available here, and the full webinar here.Defining what we mean with integration also leads to the fact that we must acknowledge that interoperability and easy to integrate is not the same thing. Considering that companies in this industry are in competition, they need differentiation and are in need for innovation also at the network layer. Such innovation by nature impacts interfaces and functionality, thereby implying that pieces are not interoperable out-of-the-box and that there is thereby an integration challenge ahead.So, identifying the various areas that represents integration challenges ahead, we can firstly identify the issue of performance in the baseband parts. When size of spectrum or number of antenna elements grow, the computational requirements explode. This, as well as the support for more throughput, calls for various accelerator solutions. Those comes with different architectural options and is at the end of the day the key enabler for making the networks more energy efficient. Efficiency comes not only from the energy consumption of the computation, but more importantly from that it together with efficient radio algorithms makes it possible to utilize the scarce radio interface better, thus reducing the energy consumed by the radio parts.Tietoevry are heavily involved in assignments from clients to build 5G products based on, for example, Intel FlexRAN reference architecture and the latest Xeon chips that address challenges mentioned above.Another integration area that emerges on the horizon is the aspect of applications running on top (or inside) Radio intelligent controllers. These apps are essentially implementing control-loops for certain aspects such as traffic steering, performance optimization or energy control. Those apps are expected to come from various suppliers, and they might have conflicting goals. It therefore means there needs to be an appropriate conflict resolution mechanism in place to control the overall behaviour. There is research ongoing in this area, and in the meantime every combination of apps needs to be properly integrated and validated.These Apps forms one important part of the need to increase automation in the way mobile networks are operated. Automation is a topic valid also for traditional RAN, but Open RAN has a new architectural approach for such automation.It is likely that communication service providers (CSP’s) will increasingly compete by reducing their operational costs, which imply that a great deal of automation is required. Such automation is naturally tied to the work processes of the specific CSP’s which in turn implies that the integration of all that operational control functionality needs to be done specifically per CSP.", Mats  Eriksson ,Data , 9.2.2023
Will robots overrule customer relationships for fund investors?,/en/blog/2023/02/will-robots-overrule-customer-relationships-for-fund-investors/,Digitalization / Tobie Horne / 3.2.2023,"It boils down to what banks should do with customer relationships. How can they develop a novel approach to succeed in the new landscape?To start the quest, we need to look at the current state of customer relationships and fund distribution. They have always been central for both the fund companies and banks.Fund companies want to achieve the best and most efficient distribution of their products at the lowest cost, while banks want to offer an attractive selection of funds coupled with added value to entice customers, not only to stay, but to use more of their products and services.Platforms came in as an appetizing alternative for fund companies, allowing simplified distribution at lower cost, due to their niche focus, modern technology stacks and reduced overhead costs compared to the banks. Many offer tools to help investors find the right mix in their fund portfolio with the least effort.But where does this leave the investor and what do customer relationships in this digital age mean? Large segments of investors have become accustomed to digital services and the ease of use they entail, but do investors lose value in exchange for convenience?""Funds are often not the core business of the banks, but a key component in driving customer acquisition and retention.""The need for guidance existsAccording to my analysis, perspectives on digital services differ between banks and fund companies.For a selected few fund companies, direct distribution of their funds to end customers is a part of their business DNA, often handling the process through in-house transfer agents and having continuous interaction with their investors in several forums.These companies have not excluded themselves from also utilizing platforms and banks as distributors, but rather view the limited number of direct investors as a means to strengthen their brand and be more than just another name on a screen.Other fund companies see direct investors purely as a cost driver due to the extensive associated pre- and post-trade activities and opt for platform distribution, bank distribution or have an institutional focus.Funds are often not the core business of the banks, but a key component in driving customer acquisition and retention. From a retail perspective, it is therefore hugely important to present and package fund instruments as part of a larger value proposition.For many investors however, it is a jungle out there. In the absence of personal advice, or the preference for digital interaction, investors seek help from actors that do not only offer products, but also digital tools and advisory services to guide them in their investment decisions.This poses several challenges for banks. Although digital renewal is in full swing at most banks, it is a big ship to turn, and composing the ideal investor experience is not achieved overnight. It includes the complexity of multiple services and products, backed by various IT systems with a healthy portion of compliance requirements thrown in.Individually tailored digital advisories?Is this what investor relationships mean in the digital age – a collection of tools and services? Or can banks, platforms and fund companies provide something more than algorithms providing options based on risk appetite, ESG profile or market segment?My view is that there is a lot to do to provide a holistic approach to the wealth of investors. Funds are much more than investments; they are vehicles to achieve bigger goals.Individually tailored digital advisories should include investments within a much broader frame of lifestyle, needs and personal ambitions. Investors need to be approached as unique individuals, rather than demographic or risk groups, and our digital strategies need to be adapted accordingly.One question remains – what is your view?I look forward to continuing the discussion with you at Fondmarknadsdagen.Feel free to connect in LinkedIn and look at our services for banks!", Tobie Horne ,Digitalization , 3.2.2023
The Value of SAP Cloud ALM,/en/blog/2023/02/the-value-of-sap-cloud-alm/,Digitalization / Leena Nissilä / 3.2.2023,"SAP provides strong support for this shift by allowing SAP Enterprise Support customers to order SAP Cloud ALM free of charge and by committing to the rapid development of SAP Cloud ALM.For quite a long time, SAP ALM tools and processes relied mostly on SAP Solution Manager. The movement towards cloud centric ALM processes started picking up pace in 2020, when SAP Cloud ALM development genuinely took off. SAP originally intended SAP Cloud ALM primarily for SAP Cloud centric customers, but at present, it already has good readiness to also be used by on-premise centric SAP customers.RISE with SAP and SAP Cloud ALMIn RISE with SAP deliveries, SAP is positioning SAP Cloud ALM and SAP Solution Manager as alternative ALM tools. Both these tools have their advantages, which should be evaluated against the customer’s situation. Some of our customers who have selected RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud implementation have also selected SAP Cloud ALM as their implementation platform, but this decision should depend on various things, such as the need for customer specific ALM processes, and the organization’s current commitment to SAP Solution Manager.SAP Cloud ALM offers various ALM tools for implementation projects, such as project management and organizational planning, agile delivery support, task management, SAP process descriptions, test management, and change and deploy management. Also, dashboard and analytics tools provide an effective view of the project situation.SAP Cloud ALM Roadmap Explorer shows you the fulfilled and planned time for new functionalitiesWhen SAP Cloud ALM (CALM) was published, it was missing a lot of functionalities compared to SAP Solution Manager. The functionalities were limited especially in the areas of test management, documentation and change management. These tools are not fully ready even today, but SAP is developing SAP Cloud ALM very actively and releasing new functionalities every second week. SAP sends notifications when they have published new features in CALM, and you can get a real-time view of the development roadmap and current status using SAP Cloud ALM Roadmap Explorer.Click the image to enlargePicture 1: © 2022 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company. All rights reserved. | PublicIf you are interested in learning more about SAP Cloud ALM, SAP arranges virtual sessions after Quarterly releases, where they share demos about the newly released features. The link for registration is available in CALM. SAP Community Call for SAP Cloud ALM Experts is available free of charge from this link: SAP | SAP Community Call for SAP Cloud ALM Experts. There are also useful recorded sessions from earlier calls.SAP Cloud ALM (CALM) for ImplementationSAP Cloud ALM for implementation contains handy tools for project management. ‘Project’ acts as a container of information that holds everything together for tracking and reporting. It is good practice to start using SAP Cloud ALM from the beginning of a project, to make use of its capabilities right from the ‘prepare and explore’ phase, and also to onboard users early on to familiarize with Cloud ALM. The prepare and explore phase can be started without connection to SAP systems.While creating a project, you can add SAP Activate task template which – together with scope – creates predefined tasks inside scopes following SAP Activate methodology. The deployment plan contains information of releases and landscapes (System groups) in project(s).Scope setup can be handled by for example Business process experts and the Project Manager. In previous projects, we have created scopes according to SAP modules like SD, Master Data, Finance, Manufacturing, etc. Next, it is a good idea to put on Solution Scenarios in scopes. There are several Solution Scenarios that you can choose to put on. If you have, for example, a S/4HANA private cloud implementation project, then SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA might be suitable for the scope. In most cases, custom specific processes are also required, in which case custom Solution Scenarios also need to be included in the scope.Task Management is one of the main functions of SAP Cloud ALM. It includes different types of tasks. Redefined tasks are generated based on the project SAP activate task template and scope. These are called template tasks. In addition to template tasks, there are other tasks that users can create based on their needs, such as User story, Project task, and Sub-task.After you have prepared the scope, you can select solution processes that fit into that scope. All of the processes that belong to the best practice solution (like SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA) are shown in the process list. For example, Accounting and Financial close (J58) could be selected as Best Practice processes in the Finance scope.Click the image to enlargePicture 2: Solution Process ScopeThe status of the solution process can be selected to portray which state the process implementation is in. During workshops, the status could be in “Design”, and during the realization phase it could be in ""Realization”. Likewise, when the process is in production, the status could be in “Production”.By clicking on a process name – such as Accounting and Financial close (J58) – you can see the solution value flow and the solution process flow. During Fit-to-Standard workshops, the processes are validated. If a BP process needs changes, the process diagrams can be copied into the custom process adapting changes to diagrams.Click the image to enlargePicture 3: Demo of Accounting and Financial CloseIf changes are required, you can model them using the most known elements within a custom diagram. Then create a requirement from changed element or custom process. A requirement is named according to where it is created. Requirements can also be created from element, process level, or the Requirement app.Click the image to enlargePicture 4: Demo of Accounting and Financial Close - Master DataYou need to describe the business needs to the requirement. Later on, the project team can go through all the requirements and agree on which ones will be forwarded to implementation, plan priority and schedule, and assign a team and project members. Planning on how to use tags also helps to classify and filter requirements.Approved requirements can be split into smaller parts called User Stories. One user story (US) can be planned to be developed during one sprint. In addition, US Requirements can link to Project tasks, Sub-tasks, test cases and features. User stories are mainly used for Agile development and project tasks for work which do not contain transport requests. ‘Feature’ is like a container for transport request(s). Feature can also be linked to User Stories. With Feature, transport requests are deployed to QA and Production Systems. With Task management, you can handle all project work. You can also use a template to mass import tasks (Requirements, US, Project Tasks, Sub-tasks) via excel to CALM.Test cases can be created by using activities from process diagrams or by creating your own activities for a Test Case. The status of testing can be seen from the Test execution apps, project overview, or Analytics reports.SAP Cloud implementation tools are linked together and give maximum value by using these integrated processes.Click the image to enlargePicture 5: SAP Cloud ALM E2E implementation status flowIn Cloud ALM there is a project overview Dashboard where you can see the status of a project. Analytics reports are also helpful, as they give you an overall picture of how the project is advancing.SAP Cloud ALM for OperationsIn SAP Cloud ALM, ‘operations’ enable monitoring a customer’s SAP systems (Hybrid). The principal monitoring functionalities are: Business Process Monitoring, Integration & Exception Monitoring, Jobs and Automation Monitoring, and Health Monitoring. With our customers, we have seen that SAP Cloud ALM for Operation monitoring is easy to take into use. Simply connecting your SAP operation system in Cloud ALM already enables you to get the first data into some of the operation monitoring tools. Then from there on, the monitoring team can gradually build up a more advanced monitoring setup with customized alert configurations, notifications, etc.There is also an SAP Cloud ALM for Services where customers can order SAP services.Click the image to enlargePicture 6: SAP ALM Cloud for OperationsWhen would be a good time to start with SAP Cloud ALM?SAP Cloud ALM provides standardized ALM solutions without the need to put time and money into upgrades or maintenance activities, as SAP will take care of all of that. The reduced need to configure SAP ALM solutions means less adaptation for customer specific requirements, but in return, it offers standardized ALM processes that are easy for the end users to adopt.The threshold to start with SAP Cloud ALM has been made exceptionally low. It is license free for customers that have SAP Enterprise Support, or at least one SAP Cloud solution. Customers do not need to invest in hardware or software. There is also no need to spend several weeks implementing SAP Cloud ALM – It is ready for use within moments after you order it from SAP. You can simply start using it immediately. Also, SAP Cloud ALM is not only for SAP Cloud Solutions. It also supports SAP Hybrid and On-premise solutions.SAP Cloud ALM is not yet perfect, and it does not have a similar level of customization possibilities as SAP Solution Manager, but SAP is developing Cloud ALM actively and the most essential features that are currently in Solution Manager will also be in SAP Cloud ALM in coming years.When you take into account the easy availability of SAP Cloud ALM and combine it with the fact that it is the future of SAP ALM, it is clear that companies have very little to lose and a lot to gain by giving it a chance.2023 will be a remarkably interesting year for SAP Cloud ALM. We are looking forward to seeing SAP customers choose this new cloud native solution along with Solution Manager. At Tietoevry, we have worked with SAP Cloud ALM in several projects, and we are happy to demonstrate it to you in Tietoevry’s own SAP Cloud ALM tenant.", Leena Nissilä ,Digitalization , 3.2.2023
Virtual cards: the perfect fit for digital natives,/en/blog/2023/02/virtual-cards-the-perfect-fit-for-digital-natives/,Sustainability / Henrik Brun / 1.2.2023,"In an earlier blog, we explained how the shift to online shopping plus concerns about the environment are driving consumers away from using plastic and towards virtual cards.Virtual cards work like physical cards, but exist in a digital wallet on the user’s phone. Using no physical materials, virtual cards dramatically reduce a bank’s use of plastics and rare earth metals. Their environmental benefits extend to zero paper and packaging and a much lower carbon footprint, since they can be issued over the air, eliminating the need for printing, paper, envelopes and posting.Sustainable, flexible – and saferAs well as being sustainable, virtual cards are more flexible than plastic cards. For instance, they can be combined with other financial products inside a digital wallet, whether that’s a loyalty scheme, a Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) option or a savings product. Banks can invite clients to flip between virtual and physical versions of their cards according to need, such as when waiting for a new physical card to arrive. Best of all, they can be issued and replaced instantly, meaning there’s no worries about wrong addresses, stolen cards and misplaced shipments.As we explain in our new white paper, virtual cards are also safer than traditional plastic cards. Virtual cards have their own unique card numbers, expiry dates, and dynamic cardholder verification code, or CVC. Typically, dynamic CVC codes are single-use, meaning a fresh code is generated for each transaction, aiding security. As they are protected by the security on a consumer’s mobile device – such as biometric and PIN factors to open card wallets – as well as strong message encryption, virtual cards are less susceptible to many fraud types.In tune with youth and the planetAt Tietoevry, our card services division helps clients set up virtual cards as subproducts rather than main products. This reduces time to market for a new virtual card from around three months to as little as a single day. Being 100 percent digital, virtual cards are rapid to set up and a lot cheaper to create and distribute than plastic – sign-up takes just a few clicks, and new virtual cards can be connected to an Apple or Google wallet almost immediately. This ease of set-up and rapid sign up opens up channels for banks to instantly attract new cardholders with products they can use right away, such instantly issued store credit cards issued while the customer is in-store, or cards with “frequent flyer” loyalty functions marketed at airports.Given young users’ appetite for new technologies, banks can design and roll out new products – such as a virtual Youth Card or affinity product – at low cost and with low user friction. Since youth cards have traditionally been low-margin products, the lower production and distribution costs make virtual cards lower risk and more attractive for banks. Furthermore, virtual cards can be targeted at specific demographics, then expanded to a wider market quickly and easily.Given these features, it’s hardly surprising that virtual cards are so appealing to young people looking for convenience and security when shopping online – especially using mobile devices. And the fact that virtual cards make this happen without costing the Earth – either financially or environmentally – is a huge attraction. As digital wallet use for online shopping continues to rocket, growing numbers of banks are turning to virtual cards as the solution of choice for generation digital.Download a free copy of Moving past plastic: why virtual cards make sense for everyone, the new white paper from Tietoevry, now.", Henrik Brun ,Sustainability , 1.2.2023
Ambitions on several fronts,/en/blog/2023/02/ambitions-on-several-fronts/,Meet our people / Recruitment  Team / 1.2.2023,"Two and a half years earlier: Caroline Aar Jakobsen is a recent Bachelor of Commerce graduate and knows it is time to enter the workforce. But she has one concern: She is passionate about something that takes up much of her time, meaning she can’t work an ordinary nine-to-five job.“I wasn’t sure if I fit in anywhere, with my background and everyday life”, she says.Handball is a big part of the everyday life Caroline is talking about. She plays for Byåsen Håndball Elite, and any working day needs to fit in with a busy training schedule. She was not sure therefore whether she could manage a full-time job, but if she were to have one, it would be within innovation and sustainability.“I have always been interested in innovation, sustainability and technology. That’s why it was only natural to apply to a tech company.”Towards the end of her studies she applied to Tietoevry Create and was offered a job soon thereafter.“After signing the employment contract, my first thought was: ‘What have I done?.’ I didn’t think I could combine the role of athlete and a career as business and technology consultant. But I decided to give it a shot and, two and a half years later, I am so happy I ended up here.”As it turned out, it wasn’t a problem combining the job with a career as a handball player. Tietoevry makes every effort to accommodate each employee. During the pandemic, Caroline worked 100 percent in her job as Scrum Master, whereas now she works 60 percent. That way, it is possible to combine work and professional sports.Caroline’s job is in large part about managing all the overlying threads in the project, steering the team, and making strategic decisions together with the customer.“Tietoevry Create had room for someone like me with slightly different needs than a nine-to-five profile that so many others match. It was positive to enter the workforce and see that you could work from home if you had a lot of other things going on and that you can have ambitions on more than just the job front.”TeamworkIn fact, Tietoevry viewed her background as a strength. In the job as project manager, this is something she takes with her, especially when building a new team.“When we build a team, we strive for diversity and a variety of backgrounds. A good team is one with breadth of expertise and understanding of each individual’s role. But it is also important that people get to shine – that they get to apply their expertise.””It’s team play, just as in handball,” says Caroline.“For instance, we have a designer who makes fabulous drawings during breaks and others who spend time climbing, downhill cycling or ski touring. Some build apps in their spare time, while many enjoy time with family and make it a priority. You can be ambitious in your career and still have an identity outside of work. And, of course, it is fun getting together with our various backgrounds and feeling a sense of community in the team.”“I love working with people and seeing that we are moving in the same direction despite, or perhaps because of, our different backgrounds and expertise. It works when everyone shares the same vision about the direction we need to take, believes in it, and feels a sense of ownership.”Who should apply to Tietoevry Create?“If you feel your profile is different and doesn’t exactly fit neatly in a box, I would send an application. We need a variety of people and we guard our differences closely.”", Recruitment  Team ,Meet our people , 1.2.2023
Towards a digitally sovereign tomorrow,/en/blog/2023/01/digital-sovereignty/,Cloud / Wenche Karlstad / 1.2.2023,"Close your eyes and think about the digital world. You might visualize an endless stream of numbers – a wave of information flowing around the globe with little regard to national borders.
In reality, data is much more tangible than we would think. All digital information has a physical location, and processing data complies with the laws and other regulations of the country of location, regardless of which country the data originates.
Therefore, defining critical data, keeping it safe, and securely moving it around are the key factors for the secure, digital tomorrow. Organizations operating in Nordic countries and elsewhere in Europe have become increasingly aware of the immeasurable value of digital sovereignty.
Securing the value of data 
A single piece of information is rarely valuable regardless of the data or its owner, but the situation changes as the amount of data increases. It is, in fact, about a globally inexhaustible and immeasurably valuable resource whose future potential of use is limitless. Organizations and societies have a lot at stake, and therefore the assessment of both the current situation and possible future risks is essential.
The core questions are: where is the information located, where does it flow, and who controls it? If the data resides on American or Chinese servers, for example, the national laws of the organization’s country or even EU regulations are little more than words. It should be noted that as much as 92 percent of European data is located outside of Europe, and the current situation has indeed sparked a lot of discussion in the EU. With a single acquisition, data can move to foreign soil and beyond the reach of national legislation. On the other hand, data centers being located on sovereign soil is not enough either. If the metadata can be managed elsewhere, true sovereignty has not been achieved.
Thus securing information requires prioritization by the organizations themselves, even though the authorities are actively developing solutions to safeguard the sovereignty of Europeans. One of the decisive measures for the future is the safe movement of information between the EU and the United States. The vision is becoming a reality, as the first official steps towards updated data transfer policies (Data Privacy Framework) have already been taken.
Defining and classifying data
The data protection regulation GDPR defined by the EU has improved the privacy of individuals, but digital sovereignty is a much broader phenomenon. It is about ensuring the continuity of businesses and societies by keeping information where it belongs. Sorting the organization’s information plays an important role: it is necessary to differentiate which data can be classified as critical according to national and regional security standards, and as for companies themselves.
There are different classifications of data: public, confidential, or restricted, for example. In addition, there may also be country-specific differences in classification methods, which must also be taken into account. This is why the first thing to do is a complete data and application assessment. Once the data has been evaluated and classified, the solutions in order to protect critical information can be applied. As the leading Nordic operator of digital solutions, Tietoevry’s vision is to secure the digital sovereignty of the Nordic countries by developing and providing the necessary services.
In addition to security, responsible digital leadership is also about environmental sustainability. According to the European Commission’s estimate, the amount of data produced globally is growing rapidly: while 33 zettabytes were produced in 2018, the number is expected to rise to 175 zettabytes by 2025. The amount of data will therefore double every year and a half. In addition, the European Commission estimates that currently, up to 80% of industrial data remains completely unused.
While classifying data to secure critical information, organizations also have the opportunity to evaluate the quality of their data and to minimize the amount of unnecessary data. “Excess” information creates an unnecessary burden on the environment if not utilized, because extra data centers and equipment are needed to maintain it.
Innovation is key
In the global data economy, information is harnessed by businesses to derive value. The information can, for example, consist of user insight or industrial output, which are further utilized in various information systems, artificial intelligence solutions, or even robotics. These are just examples of the limitless possibilities of data. Digital sovereignty is about providing incentives to promote innovation and growth as well. In the long term, innovation is the basis of the growth and well-being of society as a whole. By harnessing new technologies and growing competence, we can also pave the way for the benefit of future generations.
When digital sovereignty is ensured, companies, organizations, and even individuals can manage their own digital resources and information more independently. When the sharing of protected information takes place in an infrastructure based on trust, there are great conditions for growth and innovation.
In the Nordics, there is generally a high level of maturity and great innovative force in digitalizing services for citizens and society. However, the challenge is that small and medium-sized companies must have the same operating conditions as large ones.Responsibly ensuring a level playfield in the data economy enables further opportunities and innovation. Let’s consider Artificial Intelligence, which has enormous potential. The European Commission’s proposal for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act is expected to be finalized this year. Its goal is to regulate AI applications and align them with EU values and fundamental rights. At the same time, it would be a predictive tool for enabling growth based on the responsible use of AI technologies. To remain innovative, organizations need to stay abreast of new and emerging technologies and relevant regulatory requirements.
Despite new challenges, we should remain optimistic: with the support of experts, the organization can get a good basis for evaluating its situation. This groundwork is the foundation of digital sovereignty. No matter how big the challenges seem now, the future is full of new opportunities.
A sovereign solution to the challenge
The challenges we face are getting more complicated, but the available solutions are also developing. New dynamic cloud services make it easier for companies to balance between innovation and set requirements. Cloud services act as efficient platforms, and one of the most significant tools for achieving sovereignty is the sovereign cloud. 
Sovereign cloud is not a new concept. It has just become very topical due to a changing geopolitical landscape and new regulations that affect the control of data. To put it simply, when the cloud is sovereign, it allows access to the information within the framework of local laws and regulations. The solution also brings along the other key benefits of cloud services, such as agility, sustainability, and automation.
As with the different types of data, there are also differences between clouds, for example, in the value they create. No matter what the organization’s digital solutions contain, organizations have to compare alternatives and build a functional whole - in accordance with a multi-cloud strategy. A truly sovereign cloud, as part of a multi-cloud strategy, ensures that information remains secure and prevents foreign access to data.
A sovereign cloud is a reliable environment for data storage and processing. Information can also be transferred safely across borders so that we remain under one and the same jurisdiction. However, in addition to securing data storage - and its movement - companies must also take care of their competitiveness on global playing fields. Therefore, the requirements and regulations regarding cloud service providers must also be made as clear as possible. The European Union is currently defining the sovereignty requirements for cloud services, and the results will be announced in the near future.
Companies and organizations must continue to work together in order to grow and innovate in a changing digital market environment, where regulations define the boundary conditions of operations.

The customer portal is hotter than ever,/en/blog/2023/01/the-customer-portal-is-hotter-than-ever/,Digitalization / Jonas Prosell / 30.1.2023,"Why is it hot, then? Well, the answer is straightforward if you think about it. If the pot was brewing before the pandemic, it began to boil during the pandemic, customer behavior changed dramatically during this time, and the need for digital interfaces to interact with professional buyers accelerated enormously. And now it turns out that the behavior change is permanent. Therefore, many companies have now realized that the customer portal is a central point of contact in the customer journey for returning customers. ­­­­­­In addition, companies have gained deeper insights that customer data is the new gold and that the logged-in state creates opportunities to get to know the customer on a deeper level. Companies can gain insights into their customers' interests and ­­any problems they might be facing, and they can use these insights to personalize content, ­create relevance, develop the customer journey further, and provide valuable input into how the experience­­­­ should be developed.To live up to the professional buyer's requirements for digital interfaces.It is good to start with the customer to understand why the customer portal is essential. After all, customer needs are in focus in all types of trading. We are all consumers, and most of us shop digitally. Both for practical reasons, to save time and money, and because it is convenient. Whether we are bored or want to be inspired, what, how, and when we e-shop, everyone knows what is possible. And that expectation and that level of experience we bring into our professional lives. So, the bar for B2B trading has been raised in recent years.­­­­­Simultaneously, e-commerce and digital services for consumers set the standard for convenience and simplicity, but professional buyers are already there in the digital channel. They spend a considerable part of their buying journey digitally, searching for information to solve their problem and comparing products or solutions between potential suppliers, often long before contacting a salesperson. ­­­­And once they become customers, they want to continue to serve themselves when it suits them, retrieve information when it's timely, educate themselves when they have a gap in their schedule, and plan for maintenance, upgrades, etc., when appropriate. This is where the customer portal comes into the picture. ­­­­­­­­We've built customer portals for various industries, ranging from Medtech to steel pipes, and we're seeing some moves that resonate with professional buyers.Time is moneyBuyers want to save valuable working time. It should be quick to find what they are looking for. Recurring orders need to be facilitated. ­
Risk avoidanceIt is critical for professional buyers to find the right product. They want to make the right choice. The consequences of an incorrect purchase can, in the worst-case lead to production stops, delays, or machine failure.
Controlling the engagementProfessional buyers want to have a handle on their engagement with the selling company. They want to get an overview of their order history and find documents such as safety data sheets, certificates, etc. They also want to be able to see their prices and their invoices, among other things.
ChoiceProfessional buyers still want to talk to a seller when required, but preferably when they need expert advice. Often the customer wants to acquire knowledge himself before the contact is made.
Self-serving is easierProfessional clients want to be able to perform simple transactions or information gathering automatically or by themselves.Growth is faster in digital channels than in physicalIn our contacts with companies from various B2B industries, we see that some selling companies still need to be on track or have only come a little on their journey to digitize their customer experience. Many companies also remain at the base level of offering standard products and simple self-service.At the same time, many industries have come a long way, and enormous values are already being conveyed digitally between the companies. In some industries, more money is already being generated digitally B2B than sales through a salesperson. And growth happens faster in digital channels than in physical ones. The general trend is that digital sales are approaching, or even surpassing, in-person sales in many B2B industries.The customer portal gives the selling company a uniform and secure way to meet its customers' expectations, offer them added value, distinguish itself from competitors, and increase long-term customer relationship profitability while collecting data that enables new insights into customer needs.­­­What drives companies' investments in customer portalsIn summary, we see the following driving forces explaining why customer portals are in high demand right now:Customer expectationsProfessional buyers need better digital solutions and have expectations of a modern supplier. This is what selling companies in B2B have realized.
The customer journeyThe customer portal is needed to meet the customer where the customer carries out a large part of their buying journey as a returning customer, i.e., in digital channels, and keep the customer from competitors who offer better support.
Productivity gainsThe customer portal streamlines processes, increases productivity, and enables better scalability of the business.
Knowledge of the customerThrough the customer portal, customer data is obtained, and a platform for innovation to sell more to existing customers, increase customer lifetime value, and expand the market.To conclude, the customer portal thus improves profitability in terms of short- and long-term revenue, an opportunity to save money through efficiency, and a platform for innovation and growth. No wonder then that there is a willingness to invest.Read part 2/5 in my blog series: The right functionality for value creation.Read part 3/5 in my blog series: How to smartly build a value-creating customer portal.Read part 4/5 in my blog series: How the customer portal contributes to internal efficiency.Read part 5/5 in my blog series: Digital Commerce serves as an icebreaker för digital transformation", Jonas Prosell ,Digitalization , 30.1.2023

Companies with reporting obligations invest considerable resources in their AML/KYC activities, and sound data services provide substantial efficiency gains.Most Norwegian providers of services related to beneficial ownership do so based solely on data from the Norwegian Tax Administration's Shareholder Register. This means that Norwegian companies with foreign owners are not automatically obliged to enter information regarding ownership.- ""For more than 10 years, Data Services and T-rank have provided solutions for revealing beneficial ownership in the banks' customer population in close cooperation with Tietoevry Banking.

By combining structured and unstructured data sets with new technology and the best expert models, we are now building a Nordic data service that uses data elements from our entire service portfolio. The first step is to establish a Nordic solution for beneficial ownership and a visual shareholder map. This will be one of several new offerings we will be launching in the course of 2023, and we've really been looking forward to showing what we've been working on for the past year,"" says Ole J Jonassen, Sales Director, Tietoevry Industry & Lead Data Services for Banking Tietoevry.Swedish, Danish and Finnish ownership data includedTietoevry and T-rank are now launching an improved service in which we also include Swedish, Danish and Finnish ownership data in our calculation base. This means that Norwegian companies with Nordic owners will be able to enter who ultimately owns or controls the companies. The same applies to Nordic companies outside Norway with Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, or Swedish owners. The Nordic ownership data are now included in the basis for beneficial ownership calculation that is presented in online entries in an onboarding and/or investigative phase, as well as in our solutions for ongoing account management.In addition to the Shareholder Register, Tietoevry and T-rank have implemented Norwegian ownership data from Euronext, VPS (Norwegian Central Securities Depository) and dCompany. These provide continually updated shareholder data on the companies with the most frequent changes of ownership.Offering a Nordic Shareholder Map solutionThe expanded calculation basis with Nordic ownership data means that we are simultaneously launching a Nordic solution for the popular Shareholder Map service. This gives a visual presentation of, among other things, ownership structure, board composition and roles, and a beneficial owners map.- ""These measures raise the quality and reduce the manual effort needed for identifying beneficial owners in AML/KYC activities,"" says Jonassen.", Ole Jonassen ,Data , 30.1.2023
ChatGPT will change work faster than expected,/en/blog/2023/01/chatgpt-will-change-work-faster-than-expected/,Digitalization / Samuel Tenhunen / 25.1.2023,"Topics around ChatGPT are popping up in our social media feeds almost daily. Its natural language processing (NLP) is top-notch – and available in Finnish.My expertise lies in digital marketing and the development of sales capabilities, which is why I have compiled a list of how ChatGPT will soon aid marketing, sales and customer service.Content productionSome wonder if ChatGPT will eventually replace content creators since it can produce quality text. But this won’t happen for a while, although the bot can boost content production. If used properly, the chatbot can already create content such as sales letters or automated emails. When it comes to contextual articles, it could also assist with background research and perhaps provide tips on how to improve the content.Since the bot doesn’t know how to insert source references, its content should be reviewed carefully. ChatGPT is a search engine tool that’s highly sophisticated compared to Google, but at its best, it can create polished text for almost any purpose.SEO optimisationEven though ChatGPT is not an SEO tool, it can read texts and give recommendations on improving search engine findability, for example. It can edit texts based on its research engine findability suggestions but be mindful: search engines have been taught to recognise machine-generated texts and rank the content lower in these cases. The chatbot can suggest keywords and structural changes if the questions are specific enough.CRM and boosting marketing automationChatGPT promises that it can easily be integrated into different systems, although I’m unaware whether anyone has incorporated it as a part of an existing CRM or marketing automation. Still, Zapier, for instance, has an OpenAI integration, with API documentation available directly from OpenAI’s website.Its potential integration could significantly improve the processing of information and automation. For example, ChatGPT can analyse contact data, create segments, process performance data and complete missing information. When the pioneers are brave enough to test the limits in practice and share their insights, we’ll better understand what ChatGPT can achieve.Smarter chatbotsChatGPT is a bot, but the more it utilises data, the more personified answers it can produce. The language processing of ChatGPT is highly evolved, which is why you don’t need to create response paths, and teaching it is not required like with traditional bots. Based on a few ChatGPT tests, the Finnish texts it produces aren’t always perfect and often use repetitive expressions. But otherwise, it significantly beats other chatbots.Processing of client contactsCustomer service repeatedly receives the same technical questions, while online information banks and website FAQ sections are often used to boost customer service further. But looking for the right piece of information like this can be frustrating. ChatGPT could answer questions effortlessly, reduce contacts made to customer service centres and improve the customer experience. If the first answer isn’t satisfactory, the bot can continue the conversation and ensure that the person obtains the information required.A turning point in search engine advertising?It will be fascinating to see what change the data that ChatGPT produces will bring to search engine advertising. Right now, Google’s revenue is based on people who search and then browse websites before returning to the search engine to find more relevant results while viewing ads. If a bot can provide reliable answers quickly, search engine advertising will lose customers, requiring the whole model to be reinvented.ChatGPT’s monetisation model is still unclear, but there have been discussions of it becoming part of the Bing search engine and other Microsoft tools. Soon we’ll see what this means in practice.", Samuel Tenhunen ,Digitalization , 25.1.2023
Time to tap into the potential of Public Cloud – what to consider in the deployment and application architecture,/en/blog/2021/11/3-time-to-tap-into-the-potential-of-public-cloud--what-to-consider-in-the-deployment-and-application-architecture/,Cloud / Vjaceslavs Sorokins / 24.1.2023,"Cloud-based APIs allow the solution owner to build application logic for horizontal scaling and various maintenance automation tasks, such as replacement and delivery pipeline. This blog post is intended to walk you through these concepts.Horizontal scalingDepending on the workload, application nodes are automatically created or deleted. This allows the solution to dynamically adapt to the performance requirements and avoid the costly cloud services being reserved unnecessarily.Replace-not-repair approachThis approach could be denoted as paradigm shift in solving critical issues, as it really is a new approach when compared to how classic on-prem solutions are maintained. Instead of repairing broken deployment components, Public Cloud enables the solution owner to dynamically replace said components with new and operational ones. This, in combination with multi-node deployment, dramatically reduces service downtime.Automated delivery pipelineAlthough one cannot argue that continuous delivery pipeline is part of Public Cloud deployments only, the dynamic nature of Cloud services and tools certainly invites solution owners to automate the version delivery process. This is true for both the infrastructure components and the application itself.All-in-all, Public Cloud provides so many opportunities to solve classic data centre issues, that it is hard to resist even for the most conservative financial industry members. We at TietoEVRY have been walking this path of application modernization and Public Cloud design creation for several years now, building solid knowledge base, set of tools, and highly skilled teams.If you decide to investigate public cloud for card acquiring and issuing, TietoEVRY has a solution for you in form of a cloud based SaaS service. Or we can guide you regarding design, implementation and certification of Card Suite in Public Cloud.Related blogs

Nordic Banking 2023: Challenge And Opportunity In Changing Times,/en/blog/2023/01/nordic-banking-2023/,Digitalization / Jarkko Turunen / 23.1.2023,"A new year dawns, and it seems everyone in financial services is looking to the future. One certainty for 2023 is the continued digitalisation of banking services: last year, e-commerce grew at 17% worldwide to reach almost one dollar in five spent in some advanced economies, according to Shopify[1]. Within this lies the enormous power of the mobile platform – Insider Intelligence say that last year, some 40% of new revenue in the digital channel came through consumers using cellphones and tablets[2].At Tietoevry, we expect new services to emerge that respond to the trend towards mobile powered by Open Banking. Five years after PSD2 enabled Open Banking, advanced markets such as the UK are now seeing millions of Open Banking payments every month, with more than one in ten consumers using at least one Open Banking service in that country last year[3]. From retail banking to SMEs, clients are looking for banks to deliver faster, cheaper and easier-to-use mobile services – especially in product areas seen as expensive and slow, such as cross-border e-commerce or money transfers.New standards and an opportunityWith the development of Open Banking and more cross-border business, new standards are emerging, from the launch of data standard ISO 20022 in March this year through to Open APIs that enable easier, faster service integrations at lower cost. Although fintechs have been able to move more rapidly than traditional banks to adopt these standards given their more modern systems and less cumbersome processes, many of these fintechs have been hit by a “funding cliff” that has seen investment and deal numbers drop by 15% in the US over the last six months, according to KPMG[4]. This creates breathing room for banks to update their tech platforms and introduce services that are less expensive to maintain, lower risk and more efficient to operate while fintech competitors search for funding.Jarkko Turunen, Head of Payment Product & Services, at Tietoevry Banking said: “In 2022, banks spent 70% of their IT budgets maintaining legacy systems and just 5% on innovation.” Furthermore, continued increases in the cost of maintaining legacy systems will, in the medium term, bring their continued viability into question. In a recent report[5], McKinsey & Co make clear that the 70% of IT budgets banks apportion to legacy system maintenance is blocking innovation. McKinsey says that banks currently spend just one dollar in twenty on new services, with most of the rest dedicated to keeping decades-old systems operating. Statistics like these show just how fast the need to update legacy systems is moving from a priority to a matter of urgency for banks.What to expect in 2023“We expect further growth in instant payments, plus new services linked to Open Banking such as Request to Pay. These new services have implications for existing bank IT infrastructure,” predicts J. Turunen. The drive to faster, cheaper payment services in the mobile channel will see instant payments (IP) take off. In our region, this will likely happen through new EU regulations enabling instant payments and the launch of P27, slated for the second quarter of this year, while other markets such as the UK (Faster Payments) and the Netherlands (iDEAL) are making great headway. Likewise, we expect instant Account-to-Account (A2A) payments to continue to make inroads as consumers appreciate their speed and convenience, while new services such as Request to Pay and services linked to Open Banking), payee confirmation via AISP and Variable Recurring Payment patterns will all make their mark, enabling new opportunities related to e-commerce. These developments will also bring their own challenges, not least in terms of AML and KYC for instant and A2A payments.Elsewhere, the EU’s proposed mandate for banks to use SCT-Inst in cross-border transactions will also, if approved, necessitate further integrations and adaptation for those 40% of banks which do not currently use the system. Given such wholesale changes, pressure is building on banks to identify, build and integrate new services so that they can gain first-mover advantage in areas like instant payments and payee confirmation services via Open API requests.Fate favours the braveThe current high inflation and low growth environment coupled with a high inflow of new regulations and changing market dynamics may look daunting for Nordic banks. However, those firms smart enough to make the right investments in new, digital-first services will find abundant opportunities to create competitive advantage and gain customer loyalty. Replacing legacy tech infrastructures should now be at the heart of any bank’s future strategy – and they should be looking to work with trusted, experienced partners to make this happen rapidly and effectively.For a discussion about how you can deliver superior value and revenue growth through modern banking technologies, contact: Jarkko Turunen, Head of Payment Product & Services, Tietoevry Banking, Jarkko.Turunen[at]Tietoevry.com.", Jarkko Turunen ,Digitalization , 23.1.2023
Why Security Operations Center should be the first and last you have in place?,/en/blog/2023/01/why-security-operations-center-should-be-the-first-and-last-you-have-in-place/,Cloud / Harri Kallioniemi / 23.1.2023,"Geopolitical relief is outside the scope of services we provide, but we certainly advise and support our customer by improving their resilience against different kind of business continuity risks, including cyber-attacks.And this indeed is a business matter. A recent study on ransomware concluded that on average the systems are down for 25 days. That is 25 days an organization not doing what they are supposed to do. I know a lot of industries where that leads to almost certain bankruptcy. Another study by Deloitte concluded that less than 10 % of the cost of an attack were caused during the attack period, and most cost where the immediate aftermath and then the long-term loss of revenue.So how should companies improve their resiliency?An easy answer is to have a Security Operations Center (SOC) in place. That helps companies to detect and respond to a cyber-attack. But not just any type of SOC. The traditional SOCs are based on border protection approach which is good for keeping bulk of the attack volume in check. But what if a burglar tailgates past the front desk (same as phishing attack) and then has unlimited access to your building?You need a SOC that has sensors everywhere and continuously looks for events that are out of place, and especially event combinations. But detecting those from massive flood of events is impossible task for a human, so we need help from machine learning algorithms that continuously look for now events that are associated with an attack, or events that are out of place. As an example, you as a user logging in on Sunday 4 am to a system. The whole idea in modern SOC is not just to detect these, but also stop in tracks. In case of your unusual log in, the system forces automatic two-phase authentication, ensuring that it really is you.But there is a problem on just relaying on a SOC as the solution. It would be a bit mean to compare a SOC to a band aid, but reality is that even the best and most modern SOC is never fixing the root cause why an attack is happening.So that is why a SOC should be the last line of defense that there is when everything else has failed. Those other things are mostly about the more boring side of traditional IT operations. Configuring and updating the systems, managing your user access, designing your architecture to be more resilient. This is a work that is happening every day, and it’s the source for 99 % of your issues.Most cyber-attacks are caused by automated robots trying to find known vulnerabilities or mass phishing attacks, not by targeted effort where a super hacker finds a way through all your firewalls. You get hacked because somebody somewhere forgot to patch a known vulnerability in a system or forgot to delete the user from a system that is not a part of your single-sign-in, or left the default password in a system. These are tedious tasks that are performed by your IT people every day. But there are so many of these things to do, they are many times so complex to execute, and there are too little resources that you can take it for granted that you have a lot of such vulnerabilities in place.  Now it’s just a matter of time when somebody finds it and exploits it.This issue is not going to be improved by just doing more the same. Fortunately, there is a solution, and it’s called cloud transformation. I’m not talking about a place called cloud, but a way of working. What you need to do is to describe everything as a code. How your systems are deployed, how they are configured, how they are maintained.This has massive improvement effect on many fronts. First, it dramatically reduces the human mistakes that are bound to happen in your IT operations. You always have things done correctly, and you even have an audit log to prove it. Secondly, when the worst happens, you’re able to reduce the recovery time from those 16 days to 16 minutes, because you can do a clean installation in minutes instead of trying to fix a leaking boat with duct tape and chewing gum.And there is one more ‘and’ here. When you do that, you also advance your digitalization as now the developers can use your platforms through APIs and their productivity goes up massively. So literally striking two flies in one goes here.One more thing - Protect your data. If you lose them, your right to exist stops. Deploy encryption to all your sensitive data, protect that data with ransomware protected backups and have a copy of your data in a different country. That is a rounding error cost that will save you one day.So, evaluate your current SOC and update that with a modern approach if needed. Ensure your most sensitive and business critical data is protected against the top risks in 2020s. And continue your cloud transformation as that is the only thing in the long run that helps you.", Harri Kallioniemi ,Cloud , 23.1.2023
Tietoevry at CES 2023: it is all about software,/en/blog/2023/01/tietoevry-at-ces-2023-it-is-all-about-software/,Digitalization / Piotr Romanowski / 20.1.2023,"Every year in January, the biggest brands and innovators meet in a remarkable Las Vegas Convention Center for the Consumer Electronics Show. This year, over 100 000 visitors showed up to see the newest trends from various industries, including the automotive. There is a revolution in the industry as Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) want to be perceived not only as car producers but also as tech companies with increasing collaboration between the two industries.Automotive highlightsIn CES 2023 the automotive highlights focused on electrification, software/infotainment, new system-on-chip (SoC) components, maps, and cloud solutions. Here are a few takeaways from those trends.1. It's all about softwareUndoubtedly, software has become a key enabler for automotive innovation as software-defined vehicles are starting to redefine the whole industry. The trend is driven by customers' demands known from the smartphone experience – they want responsive touch screens, digital clusters, a variety of infotainment applications, and internet connectivity. Software is becoming the main factor that brings value to the drivers' and passengers’ car experience. The new features enabled by software updates are also seen as a new source of revenue for the industry.Companies across the automotive value chain need to harness the opportunities of the ongoing revolution. This is one of the main reasons big OEMs (like BMW, Mercedes, and many others) are firmly committed to Software-Defined Vehicles.This year, CES presented vehicles, and domain solutions were nothing short of a software-defined automotive reality – including connectivity, cloud-based solutions, and infotainment systems.❝ The automotive software market is projected to more than double in size from $31 billion in 2019 to roughly $80 billion in 2030. McKinsey report2. In-Car personalized dashboardsPlaying around with new infotainment platforms is the easiest way to experience the automotive software revolution. Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Companies want to differentiate between the in-car experience and the variety of features their platforms provide to drivers and passengers.At this year’s CES, Afeela from Sony and Honda stood out with a side-to-side panoramic, enormous screen, and separate back seat passenger displays. Garmin also proudly presented the Unified Dashboard — the Android Automotive-based infotainment that will run simultaneously on a single SoC with safety-critical systems powered by BlackBerry QNX hypervisor technology. The demo presented the capabilities of AAOS delivering a multi-zone customized experience, including a personal user interface profile for each passenger, 5G connectivity, streaming services, and a cloud-based gaming.3. Cloud solutionsYet another significant automotive industry trend, is strongly connected to the software-defined reality. To deliver new software-defined car functionalities in a fast manner, enabling unique experiences and a new source of income for the manufacturers, a cloud-based environment is needed.Cloud solution providers were very active during CES – there were announcements of collaboration from Microsoft, General Motors and Amazon Web Services to deploy brand-new vehicle services based on the MS Azure cloud solution. All favor simplifying software development and speeding up the deployment and updates process. Also, Qualcomm joined forces with Salesforce to develop a new connected automotive platform built with Snapdragon Digital Chassis and Salesforce Automotive Cloud to enhance connected services through driving data analysis.4. ElectrificationIndeed not a new trend, but this year we could see a complete focus on electrification with not much tension on hybrid vehicles. We witnessed the debut of brand-new concept cars from BMW (mind-blowing Vision Dee vehicle with e-ink body color-changing technology, and the ID7 electric sedan from Volkswagen. Stellantis presented the futuristic Peugeot Inception model and stunning RAM 1500 Revolution EV truck concept. As a matter of fact, not only cars but a massive variety of different EVs were there, including boats, electric tractors, motorbikes, scooters, and bikes.Alongside brand-new vehicles, various infrastructure solutions dedicated to electrification were shown, including modern charging stations including Mercedes-Benz’s high-speed charging network in the US to compete with Tesla's supercharging stations.5. Vehicles autonomyThe race toward fully autonomous driving, as a holy grail of the industry, is in full swing. Compared to previous years, we couldn't spot self-driving car demos or self-driving Ubers on the streets of Las Vegas. However, the trend expanded with new use cases, including shared mobility solutions from companies like Holon and ZF Group believing that public transportation will heavily rely on people-mover electric vehicles soon.Regarding the sensors, LiDAR (light detection and ranging) solution companies dominated CES. The reason is simple – LiDAR technology helps automakers with autonomous driving development. Luminar, a leading company in this field, showcased different cars equipped with its newest technology, including the long-awaited Volvo EX90.Powerful computing platforms responsible for real-time sensor data processing must support autonomous driving solutions. Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC this year, supported by advanced computing capabilities and cloud-native architecture.Talking about autonomous driving in practice – during CES, Mercedes-Benz announced that its car reached Level 3 autonomy in Nevada; another state approval process is ongoing in California. The German OEM thus became the very first automaker to launch a Level 3 automated driving platform in the US.6. PartnershipsAs automotive software platforms become increasingly complex, neither OEMs nor Tier-1 can deliver complete solutions for a modern, software-defined vehicle on their own. That's why we observed numerous partnerships between companies during CES 2023, as mentioned above.We were delighted to see new solutions presented by our customers and partners at CES. Including Here Technologies innovations: Automated Driving Zone, a cloud-hosted software that allows manufacturers to decide when and how to activate automated driving functionalities as well as UniMap – automated mapping technology allowing digital maps to be rapidly created soon using AI.In Tietoevry, we also strongly believe that one of the critical success factors is having a solid alliance within the industry. This year Tietoevry Create partnered with AUTOSAR and COVESA at the CES accompanying event - Networking & Reception Showcase, proving how various solutions from different organizations can complement each other. Tietoevry Create team extended the AUTOSAR PiCar demo, which represented a base Adaptive platform functionality, with a COVESA Vehicle Data Specification solution.What an inspiring event, thank you CES, and see you all next year!Read more about how we drive automotive software solutions forward", Piotr Romanowski ,Digitalization , 20.1.2023
ESG – The biggest change agenda of the decade requires data management capabilities to scale,/en/blog/2023/01/esg-the-biggest-change-agenda-of-the-decade-requires-data-management-capabilities-to-scale/,Data / Björn  Heir / 19.1.2023,"The ESG topic is driven from the top by the United Nations, the European Union, and Non-governmental organizations, as reflected in a flood of regulatory agendas. At the same time, ESG has strong support from the public and consumers with a sense of being already overdue.While enjoying big momentum, ESG brings a notation of ‘meaningfulness’ to corporates and organizations. As in all disruptions, there is clearly a possibility for actors to benefit from the change. You can choose to become a forerunner, and position favourably against competitors that are unwilling, unable, or simply too slow to adapt.The stakes are rising. We have seen sustainability and ESG going from being communications and branding-driven topics into and an issue that boards, top management, chief risk officers and chief data officers must attend to.

Cybersecurity is ‘going left’ in 2023,/en/blog/2023/01/cybersecurity-is-going-left-in-2023/,Cybersecurity insights / Maria Nordgren / 12.1.2023,"Shift left is related to DevSecOps – i.e. development, security and operations – and means ‘baking in’ cybersecurity to applications as early as possible. I would argue that this change in thinking will become a trend in cybersecurity in 2023, along with a shift to more proactive thinking. By this I mean built-in security; implementing cybersecurity protocols across the whole IT architecture and stack to make security an increasingly integral part of IT.Being proactive also refers to the ways threats are identified and dealt with. It’s no longer sufficient to wait around and hope not to be noticed by cybercriminals. We need to act before they notice us.One example of this proactivity is that having a separate security, information and event management (SIEM) system is a thing of the past. What is needed is for the security operations centre (SOC) to become a fully integrated hunter that proactively and constantly sniffs out cyberthreats. SOCs should no longer only monitor the environment, they should also actively – and even aggressively – hunt for all things evil in the digital world.Why Security Operations Center should be the first and last you have in place?This proactive approach has implications for how an organization acquires, sets up and conducts its cybersecurity. Gone are the days of ten-year security outsourcing contracts. Cybersecurity and the threat landscape of today evolve far too fast. If you’re slow in acquiring and building your setup, it will become obsolete immediately.Thus today’s agreements need to include the modernization of security agreements in such a way that the organization is not tied in to only one vendor. In terms of the cybersecurity mix – i.e. technology, people and processes – one needs to have flexibility and agility in a completely different way to before. Our customers are already asking for such a shift.All this brings us to the key component that continues to lay the foundation for cybersecurity: risk assessment. An organization itself needs to assess its own risks, and plan and act upon them. This is a priority, as the organization is ultimately responsible for handling its cyber risks and for building a cybersecurity framework that accounts for these risks in the most effective way.I leave you with these thoughts: please consider getting a great cybersecurity partner, and keep your cybersecurity practise growing and evolving. Shifting left in cybersecurity will be the trend in 2023, but also the way of the future.Please feel free to reach out to me to discuss how we could make this work for your organization.", Maria Nordgren ,Cybersecurity insights , 12.1.2023
Power through the challenges of moving your payments to cloud,/en/blog/2021/11/2-power-through-the-challenges-of-moving-your-payments-to-cloud/,Cloud / Vjaceslavs Sorokins / 11.1.2023,"PCI-DSS requirements bring cloud deployment complexity to another levelIt is a challenging task to design an infrastructure, tools, and procedures to be compliant with payments industry security standards. To ensure compliance with PCI-DSS requirements, you should be prepared for significant investments to build the solution design and knowledge base within operational teams.Data location is limited by customer requirementsData residency and sovereignty are important aspects for payment industry participants (especially within the EU region), when assessing overall solution security. Our experience shows that with proper planning, design, and implementation it is possible to assure required data protection levels. This concerns both the data residency and security, where various legal and regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS) need to be taken into account.Network latency becomes a factor when building distributed systemsWhen moving into hybrid cloud environment (by lift-and-shift approach), initial customer expectations regarding overall solution performance might prove to be overestimation at best. Careful deployment planning is required to minimize the latency impact on mission critical online systems. It is worth noting that latency impact is directly linked with software architecture and data volumes the solution must process. The higher the transaction volumes, the more effort must be put into cloud-based deployment design.Latency depends not only on physical distance, but on the network infrastructure stability, as well. Public, shared network might not be sufficient for backbone data transfers within distributed software systems. Dedicated infrastructure with isolated channels and controlled setup is a solution to achieve guaranteed data throughput and low latency levels required by mission-critical online software systems.Compliance is key when creating remote accessDistributed systems introduce a need for remote access. These access channels must be formed so that they are compliant with PCI-DSS requirements, even if routed over public network infrastructure.Cloud providers lack services that are specific to the cards processing industryThere are several items that are specific to cards processing solutions and not met in any other industry. For instance, none of the public cloud companies provide payment HSM and Visa/MasterCard connectivity devices as a service. To accommodate these, you need to review co-location options, for example cooperation with private data centres. Another option is to host said devices in your own data centres, but this increases the PCI-DSS certification scope.The good news is that with constant push from the industry, we do expect to see payment HSM and Visa/MasterCard connectivity devices becoming available as a service in major cloud provider portfolios. Until then, many of our customers in the Nordics have chosen TietoEVRY private cloud HSM hosting and management services with considerable success.How to build an application architecture that helps to gain the full advantages of the cloud?

Tech predictions for 2023,/en/blog/2023/01/tech-predictions-for-2023/,Sustainability / Mario  Blazevic / 10.1.2023,"Mario Blazevic, Head of Cards, Tietoevry Banking– Sustainability is becoming a topic that cuts across virtually all sectors of the economy, including cards and payment services, says Blazevic.As consumers are becoming increasingly more concerned about their own environmental footprints, Blazevic and his colleagues are looking into how they can help them make consumer choices that align with their values.– This could for example mean that if you have chosen a product with a high carbon footprint when shopping online, you will be presented with more climate-friendly alternatives before finalizing your purchase. This could include information about how much C02 you will save by choosing a more environmentally friendly option. To me, these kinds of solutions are what purposeful technology is all about and can help bring about real change.In a year where the global news cycle has been dominated by a challenging geopolitical landscape and an energy crisis in Europe, it comes as no surprise that Blazevic also mentions security and the ability to cope with an unpredictable and rapidly changing world as themes that he thinks will be important in 2023.– The current geopolitical situation and the on-going energy crisis have of course put security and resilience near the top of everybody’s agenda, and I expect this to continue this year. For banking, this means that we must continue to develop new technology and use the latest available solutions that provide the highest levels of security and robustness in the industry.Maria Nordgren, Head of Cybersecurity Services, Tietoevry Connect– I think that for the field of cybersecurity, what is known as the “shift left” will be an important trend in 2023, says Nordgren.– Simply put, this means that security considerations are taken into account early in the process of developing a new application or product. This is something that we are seeing already, and that I expect will become even more salient going forward. In fact, I would go even further and say that the shift left will increasingly come to cover the development of the entire security stack. Everything starts with risk mapping, all organizations need to do their homework in cyber risk mapping. I think it is fair to say that part of the reason for this is the ongoing war in Ukraine.This approach will have implications for how organizations carry out their cybersecurity work, according to Nordgren.– What is known as SIEM, or security information and event management can soon be a thing of the past. What is needed instead is a SOC, a security operations center, and a new SOC at that. One that proactively and constantly is on the lookout for cyber threats.Learn more in Maria's recent blog post: Cybersecurity is ‘going left’ in 2023Ida Bohman Steenberg, Head of Sustainability, Tietoevry– We are seeing a clear shift from when a focus on sustainability used to be something that was considered nice to have to where it is now part of the license to operate for many companies, says Bohman Steenberg.According to Tietoevry’s own sustainability expert, many companies now find themselves in a completely different regulatory environment than just a few years ago.– There is a tsunami of regulations related to sustainability just around the corner. Many of them are international in scope, such as the EU taxonomy and the CSRD.Bohman Steenberg explains that companies’ sustainability efforts are becoming broader in scope, and she expects this will continue this year.– We are seeing an increased focus on human rights, for instance. The Norwegian Åpenhetslov, which requires companies to carry out due diligence reporting to stop, prevent and limit negative impacts on human rights and decent work is an example of this change.This, however, does not mean that issues like climate change will receive less attention, according to Bohman Steenberg.– I think it is fair to say that climate change is the biggest challenge of our time and will continue to be so in the foreseeable future. For Tietoevry, this means that we will continue to work to reduce our own carbon footprint, and that many of our customers will do the same.Sebastian Reichmann, Head of Productization, Data, and AI, Tietoevry Industry– When it comes to AI, it is exceedingly difficult to make predictions, because the technology is developing very quickly and because of the broader availability of infrastructure and open-source concepts is driving faster adoption. This is fueling rapid AI-based concept innovation and will establish new best practices for business processes in many more industries, Reichmann says.He mentions language processing as a field in which we saw some interesting projects in 2022, with open-source services like chat.openai.com or openai.com/dall-e-2/ ,that were used by millions of people globally in a matter of days.– These models create texts and pictures based on textual human input and even write working software code if users ask them to. Going forward, it will be very interesting to follow how we end up using this technology and what kind of new solutions it can help generate.Reichmann thinks that the question of how to best regulate this new technology will become increasingly important. Upcoming legislation like the EU AI act, is an important first step, but effective implementation requires an active dialogue between lawmakers, technology providers, and the public.– There are obviously no clear and easy answers here, but I think it is fair to say that this discussion will be important going forward. Related to this, I also think we will see a change in the debate from “Is AI good or bad?” to “How can AI be used responsibly?”Tietoevry’s Public 360’s AI chief points out that also those of us who are just regular consumers need to improve our understanding when it comes to opportunities, boundaries and responsible use of AI. Is that something AI could actually help us with? We asked chat.open AI to find out:How can AI be utilized responsibly?There are several ways that AI can be used responsibly:Ensuring transparency: It's important for the decision-making processes of AI systems to be transparent and explainable, so that users understand how the AI is arriving at its conclusions.
Ensuring fairness: AI systems should be designed and trained in a way that avoids biases and ensures that all users are treated fairly.
Protecting privacy: AI systems should be designed with privacy in mind and should only collect and use personal data in a transparent and ethical manner.
Ensuring accountability: It's important to have clear rules and regulations in place to ensure that AI systems are used ethically and responsibly, and to hold those who develop and use AI accountable for any negative consequences that may arise.
Promoting diversity and inclusion: AI systems should be developed and used in a way that promotes diversity and inclusion, and that takes into account the needs and perspectives of a wide range of users.
Ensuring security: AI systems should be designed and implemented in a way that protects against cyberattacks and other security threats.By following these principles, AI can be used in a responsible and ethical manner to benefit society and improve people's lives.So, if our experts are correct, keeping up with an expanding sustainability agenda, and being able to continuously adapt to a new geopolitical reality will be important this yearRead more of our insights here", Mario  Blazevic ,Sustainability , 10.1.2023
Risk Management and Client Money: Balancing the Two,/en/blog/2023/01/client-money-management/,Data / Torill H.  Larsen  / 30.12.2022,"Self-service account opening and segregation of fundsAn issue that affects companies managing client money is the necessity to segregate client accounts to avoid co-mingling of funds owned by different clients. This is often a legal requirement for law firms, property management companies, insurance companies, pension administrators and the like. Often referred to as Client Money Management (CMM) it usually involves the creation of multiple physical client bank accounts to keep funds separate to adhere to regulations. They are also referred to as Escrow accounts or services.CMM not only increases the number of accounts that need to be maintained but those accounts need to be tracked for interest allocation and of course they must be reconciled.The management of client money is a headache for many companies as bank reconciliation, bank account management becomes increasingly complex as the business expands. With account opening comes the Know Your Customer (KYC) process which has been highlighted by responders in our “The future of corporate cash management” survey in 2022 as being “slow, cumbersome and fragmented”. This also creates additional costs for treasury. In addition, the more bank accounts the greater the risk of fraud events.Banks have struggled to help their clients with this problem for years and their hands have been tied because many of the processes involved have been by nature manual and labour intensive. Until now that is, CMM virtual account can solve many of the problems highlighted above.With CMM virtual account the process of setting up an account is given to the corporate client, and they can do this easily and without the many issues of KYC. As the account is virtual many of the regulations that exist for physical accounts are not necessary. It’s what we call “self-service account opening”. Accounts can be opened in a matter of minutes not days.In addition, the challenges of segregating accounts are made simpler as accounts being virtual can be limitless reflecting the way business is conducted. So, for example, if a property management company wants to create property portfolios linked to a master account but keeping client money segregated this is possible and quick to set up. Powerful reporting means that clients can slice and dice information in whatever way they desire. This ensures that any regulatory reporting requirements are easy and quick to produce.CMM virtual account solves many of the challenges for these companies’ ensuring segregation of accounts to avoid co-mingling of funds owned by different clients. So, businesses can create account structures that adhere to the regulations but more quickly and less costly than before. Clients are looking to their banks for innovative solutions to difficult problems and CMM virtual account is one example where banks can add value.Alongside the benefits already identified there are further advantages that clients are looking as highlighted in our survey, they includeRationalisation and simplification of physical bank accounts and banking relationships leading to cost reduction.

Visibility and Control for Corporates,/en/blog/2023/01/virtual-cash-management/,Data / Torill H.  Larsen  / 30.12.2022,"Centralisation and agilityIf the last few years have taught treasurers anything it is that they need to be able to react to world events quickly. The concept of agile treasury management whereby the business of treasury can perform alongside such events has become a necessary means of survival. Virtual Cash Management (VCM) is a powerful tool that allows corporations to adopt an agile treasury management model. Not only does VCM help treasurers react more quickly to events, but it also helps them achieve their strategic goals be they centralisation, cost efficiencies or risk reduction.At its simplest, virtual cash management involves organising and reporting transactional data from a rationalized number of physical bank accounts. Segregation and aggregation of transactions and balances enables a centralised visibility of liquidity using virtual account structures, while providing transactional detail at virtual account level for reporting and audit-trail purposes. Virtual cash management can be self-administrated which means corporates can decide which accounts to open and initiate this themselves. The Tietoevry “Future of corporate cash management” survey in 2022 highlighted that corporates find the process of bank account management to be cumbersome and costly so anything that helps this is welcome.A little-known fact is that virtual accounts corporate customers can create account structures reflecting liquidity held in accounts in other banks, with a multi-bank virtual overlay consolidating liquidity positions. Account information from other banks can be populated through statements or Open Banking APIs (e.g., PSD2). It is also possible to initiate payment requests from the virtual accounts that are linked to the physical accounts held in the other bank. As the corporate trend continues of banking with multiple banks (see survey) then this becomes even more relevant.Additionally, VCM provides a mechanism for administering “on-behalf-of” relationships within entity hierarchies and centralised payables and receivables processing. In such a structure, payments and collections of an entire company can be managed from a small number of dedicated physical bank accounts owned by the parent entity and supported by virtual accounts. Centralisation of this nature brings other benefits including improved liquidity, better FX rates and reduced risk.VCM enables banks to offer their clients more simplified banking structures which support business growth and bring greater control and visibility to treasury processes. Corporates want banks to be their partners and this value-added service helps with that relationship.The latest virtual accounts technology enables a fundamental transformation in the provision of global cash management services. For example, notional pools associated with the same physical account in a domestic structure can be administered virtually, where participating entities are linked virtually to the same physical bank account. Pooling and sweeping enable customers to gain a greater visibility of their cash and thereby better control, something that corporate treasurers are always striving for.Virtual cash management is perfect for corporations that are seekingCentral visibility of multi-bank funds.

Automation of Accounts Receivables – a Step Too Far?,/en/blog/2023/01/accounts-receivables/,Data / Torill H.  Larsen  / 30.12.2022,"Virtual accounts, by their nature already automate the process of categorizing various transactions and cashflows, and by the time transaction data arrives in an ERP or other back-office system, it has already been organized and sifted and can be reconciled automatically. In our recent survey, “The future of corporate cash management”, 57% of respondents cited that improved reconciliation was a driving factor for choosing a virtual account structure.Time savings and error reductionWhile many automated receivables applications deal with automated invoice generation and follow-up, virtual accounts solve reconciliation challenges by allocating “published” (clearing recognizable) identifiers at the virtual account level as part of an on-behalf-of relationship. Thus, while funds are received into a single physical account, incoming funds are also automatically allocated to individual virtual accounts or sub-ledgers.It is also possible to assign multiple published account references to a single virtual account. Together with itemized ERP reporting, these features promote higher rates of straight through ERP reconciliation, reduced levels of ledger inaccuracies, improved visibility of payment data leading to more informed decision making. All the above lead to time savings and reduced errors which result in cost savings, itself a major factor identified in our survey. Corporates are looking to their banks to help reduce costs and by offering such products banks are fulfilling this requirement.Another finding that came from the survey is that corporates expect their banking partners to step up their technology development. Covid-19 and the Ukraine war have highlighted the need for better and quicker information to be available. ""A key challenge for banks is to provide near real-time reporting to VAM from legacy systems. API’s are enablers which provide integration capabilities ensuring timely delivery and visibility of transactional data"", says Alexandra Helen Larsen.Virtual Accounts are an important tool for corporates that are seekingImproved reconciliation rates. Account Receivables reconciliation is still often a manual process. This is both time consuming and error prone and eliminating this has become a key challenge for many corporations.





Trackable and transparent payment data. Incoming receipts can be hard to identify, as they often come from bank accounts that do not clearly identify the company that was invoiced, have missing or incorrect reference to the invoice or combine several invoices into single money transfer. A virtual account number per customer or even per invoice serves as a unique identifier in this case.

How IoT can enable your digital transformation – 3 tips to succeed,/en/blog/2023/01/how-iot-can-enable-your-digital-transformation--3-tips-to-succeed/,Data / Michael Westberg / 28.12.2022,"When you do a search on ""Internet of Things"", you get a number of more or less technical definitions.I think IoT can be seen as the integration of physical objects, sensors and machines (things) with the global telecommunications network, where the things become visible in, and interact with the digital or ""virtual"" environment. It gives us a completely new level of interactivity with our physical environment, as consumers and in industry and society. This can give us better and more efficient healthcare services, a faster and more efficient transformation towards a sustainable society and provide new revenue streams for businesses.The possibilities of IoT are enormousIoT has reached an inflection point where it goes from being used in islands of ""application silos"" and in early niche markets, to becoming an ubiquitous enabler in an exponentially growing wave of new products and services in our private and professional lives. According to Ericsson, connected things will have an average annual growth of 18% in the coming years – i.e. more than a doubling in five years (source: IoT connections forecast – Mobility Report 2022). I strongly suspect this is on the low side, as we will see accelerated technological consolidation and streamlining, new networking effects and lower costs based on higher volumes, in a virtuous cycle.IoT is an important part of a wave of disruptive technologies that are now standard components in a new IT landscape, and where we at Tietoevry are also very involved: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and distributed cloud computing are probably the most relevant in an IoT context . We can already see dramatic changes of entire sectors, such as in the automotive and transport industries, driven by new players such as Tesla (based on a a potent mix of cellular IoT, cloud-native technologies, machine learning and Li-Io batteries). This in turn drives new efficiencies - according to Bloomberg NEF, Li-Io batteries for vehicles cost a fifth today compared to 2013 and despite a rebound in 2021, they expect continued yearly price drops of approx. 10% in the coming years.New ecosystems, business models and application areas are emerging in a ""Schumpeter's Gale"" of creative destruction.So, how do we best work with strategies, introduction and operations etc. around IoT-based services, which are a fundamental part of the digital transformation of companies and the public sector?Here are some thoughts on how to strategize, deploy and operate IoT-based services as part of a digital transformation of enterprises and public sector:Technology-wise, we need to ensure massive scalability in all dimensions, ""end-to-end"" security and privacy management as well as integration and interoperability and not least the reuse of common assets across different applications. Real-time information about the physical environment will become an even more high-value asset. Equally important is management of computing capacity; the algorithmic intelligence and thus decision-making (automated or with a human involved) will be distributed in much more fine-grained and dynamic ways.





Business-wise, strategically, operationally and tactically, we are all navigating a new competitive landscape, with new eco-systems and business models (such as products delivered as subscription services). Creating useful information and new knowledge from the new data streams as well as building the capabilities to rapidly act on this, becomes a critical success factor. Partnerships, co-creation and management of new ecosystems become even more important as strategic tools.





While the underlying drivers of digital transformation are technology-based, we must prioritize the human and societal aspects in order to get the successful results we want and to avoid negative consequences in the short and long term. From a human and organizational perspective, we need to be agile, ensure that the right competencies are available and that applications and their interfaces are truly usable and useful. Meeting legal and ethical requirements for personal integrity and security is of course paramount. If we do not fully incorporate the human dimensions from the start, we will miss new opportunities, fail in our investments and risk backlash in media and society.The pace of IoT and digital transformation is happening at varying speed in different industries and consumer segments, but I am convinced that in a few years’ time we will look back and be amazed of the massive changes we will have experienced in our professional and personal lives.Tietoevry Create are experts in planning, building solutions and implementing digital transformation, with deep expertise in both the latest mobile technology and IoT, and in all IT-related aspects of both private and public business.

Tietoevry Care ecosystem collects enterprises with different competencies together to realize shared goals,/en/blog/2022/12/veturi-ecosystem-digital-healthcare-services/,Digitalization / Petteri Mussalo / 22.12.2022,"The ecosystem members have various kinds of roles, and all members benefit from cooperation when they work for the collective value for a group of service or product consumers. The ecosystem provides the possibility to develop scalable, portable systems for customers and meet their various needs. All the different pieces of an ecosystem product entity have been defined, and they are used and combined in a different manner in each entity. The users play a key role in development, by a customer centric way. In addition to ecosystem partners working for the research or development, the future users attend to decision making. The culture enables the ecosystem to make the best decisions keeping both user and ecosystem in mind.Healthcare information technology is strictly regulated by national and global legislation. The closer we get to the processing of patient data, the more important it is to comply with the regulation from the start. Hence, in all cases the ecosystem has an orchestrator who carries the responsibility of the ecosystem operations – the service or product delivery, utilization, use and maintenance. Tietoevry acts in Veturi as the orchestrator.Software utilizes more and more new technology, like advanced analytics and machine learning components. According to the EU medical device directive, the software is interpreted as medical device, and this sets limits for software development, testing and delivery. Tietoevry’s answer to this challenge is to follow the regulation guidelines from the early development stages and be prepared for the accreditation. The existing quality manual and processes support to notify the regulation through the development life cycle.Work in the Care ecosystem is advancing well, with several research collaboration initiatives ongoing. The voice of all the stakeholders will be heard in the development of an integrated platform for digital health and care services, making a shortcut to the new Health 4.0 era.", Petteri Mussalo ,Digitalization , 22.12.2022
Data lakes and warehouses part 5: Hands on solutions,/en/blog/2022/12/data-lakes-and-warehouses-part-5-hands-on-solutions/,Data / Timo Aho / 20.12.2022,"In parts 1-4 of this blog, I discussed the paradigms of data lakes and data warehouses and compared the characteristics of key technologies such as Databricks, Snowflake and Azure Synapse Analytics.Previous posts are:Data lakes and warehouses part 1: Intro to paradigmsData lakes and warehouses part 2: Databricks and SnowflakeData lakes and warehouses part 3: Azure Synapse point of viewData lakes and warehouses part 4: ChallengesIntroductionThis post digs deeper into technology than the previous ones and might need a bit more technical understanding. Moreover, technologies evolve fast and, thus, the information deprecates significantly faster. I base the learnings on my own and colleagues’ experience which also increases over time.I have recently worked in Microsoft Azure cloud environment and concentrate mostly on that area. In addition to that, I have a few years of experience of Amazon Web Services.Development principlesLet’s start with some background discussion because my suggestions are based on them.One of my personal principles is to take the minimal version of the ‘bus factor’ into account. We need to prepare for the possibility of a single or many team members getting COVID or winning a jackpot. In practice, it is important to reduce dependency on a single person with a bit of cross-functionality: at least two people should be able to solve any given project task.This results also in better code quality and technological choices. You will probably get less unpleasant surprises. Moreover, it reduces the stress level by preventing an individual from burning out. It gives you freedom to enjoy vacation without being interrupted.Some methods are technical and straightforward: documentation and storing everything as code in version control, for instance, Infrastructure as Code – IaC, and having multiple identical environments with continuous deployment DevOps pipelines. However, the more painful ones are nontechnical: code reviewing and pair programming, especially the notorious novice-expert pair programming. In the latter one, an expert monitors and mentors a novice working on code created by the expert.It is obvious that this way of working is not plausible in all projects such as MVPs or pilots. However, the aim is good to keep in mind.Third-party cloud application – Infrastructure managementInfrastructure as Code (IaC) tools enable many things: reviewing, automatic deployment, and copying existing good practices including network, permissions, and security. They also often notify you about risky manual changes that bypass the process.Nevertheless, IaC might not offer enough benefits in all cases as they are not compatible with all technological components. Moreover, duplicating environments might not be possible in all projects.There are a few alternatives for IaC and cloud infrastructure management tools. Cloud providers typically offer ways to describe the infrastructure in semi-structured configuration files or even full IaC tools such as Azure Bicep. The tools are still limited to cloud native resources and do not fluently support many third-party solutions, Databricks, Snowflake, and others.Nowadays, the most used third party IaC tool for cloud infrastructure is Terraform. It uses its own configuration language and is available for a variety of resources. Pulumi is a more recent alternative. It is a programming language-based tool supporting Python, Typescript and Java. If most of the team is comfortable with programming, you should give it a try.Third-party cloud application - Network and authorizationSome non-native tool problems raised in the previous blog post were network configuration, authentication, and authorization.A major networking problem with both Databricks and Snowflake is the multitude of different layers to handle. These could include the actual data storage, compute environment, API layer, and front-end environment for user access. However, in Azure cloud, there has recently been significant progress. Both Snowflake and Databricks offer Azure Private link service which should allow secure access in most scenarios.In an Azure environment, we have at least three categories of authentication and authorization management:How Databricks and Snowflake handle the user permissions internally?
How Azure native resources access Databricks/Snowflake resources?
How third-party tools access native Azure resources?In the Azure environment, the first two cases are straightforward: Both Databricks and Snowflake support Active Directory syncing. Thus, you can get Azure native users to the third-party tool and manage the permissions within.The third question is tricky. The best option would be to use Azure native authentication and authorization for Databricks or Snowflake users. For Azure storage, Databricks offers multiple ways for access, but all of them have either usability or authorization issues. Personally, I prefer the deprecated AD passthrough for data storage or the creation of a separate workspace for each permission group.In addition, you hopefully store the sensitive information in Azure Key vault. With Databricks you need to trust its internal security model and give it full data access with a common service principal.With Snowflake you have less options, whether you like it or not. Access to Azure storage is possible only with a common service principal. Moreover, there is no direct Azure Key Vault Integration.Common cloud data questionsThere are some general questions that need to be answered in a cloud data environment.The obvious one is how to manage tools that are difficult to take into the version control, review, and pipeline deployment. This includes analytics tools such as Power BI or Tableau, and some ETL tools including Azure Data Factory. My suggestion is to use these tools in the most trivial way without adding too much business logic to them. For example, Azure Data Factory can be used to trigger Databricks notebooks or Snowflake SQL procedures.Another question is how to make sure codebase and IaC configurations are up-to-date, and no manual changes are made. The answer is a standard software engineering solution - a full redeployment of all resources from scratch. This can be done either in a development environment or by creating a separate smoke test sandbox environment. The use of smoke environment also helps with another typical problem, testing. End-to-end data pipeline testing is a lot easier.Paradigm – Apache SparkIn the case of Databricks and Apache Spark, usage of DevOps practices is moderately easy. Git integration and code reviewing are straightforward with the new Repos functionality.As mentioned in the previous post, a typical problem with Spark is the management of data lake files. Many small Parquet files are very ineffective for Spark processing. As a rule of thumb, try to keep the file size around 100 MB to 1 GB.Parallel processing with Parquet or ORC files is also problematic. Fortunately, the current improvements to data lake file formats help you. There are a few alternatives, but for Databricks the open Delta file format is a natural choice. Delta offers ACID transactions for parallel processing and handles file size optimization neatly.Paradigm – SQLAs mentioned in the previous blog post, SQL does not fit into DevOps mindset very well. SQL handles both infrastructure, code, and data state in parallel making version control and code reviewing exceptionally important in a multi-developer environment.Fortunately, there are a few tools enabling this. Let us take a brief look at Flyway, dbt and Liquibase, which all have open-source versions to help you out.Flyway can be described as a simple versioning tool for SQL files. It takes care of SQL not being executed multiple times and allows simple review before migration.On the other hand, dbt is more versatile. It is based on SQL but includes a macro language which reduces code redundancy and enables minimal testing. From DevOps perspective, it unfortunately misses a critical feature, dry run.The third alternative, Liquibase, uses its own semi-structured configuration to generate SQL. It is specifically meant for DevOps type development cycle but lacks SQL readability.Snowflake has some other practical questions to deal with. Accessing Azure storage is a multiple phase process with permissions and service principals. Moreover, it is easy to get lost in granular SQL permission control. Due to these, Snowflake is prone to manual changes. In both cases, one should carefully document these in IaC configuration or SQL. You should also consider redeploying the environment now and again.Snowflake has some great features for, for instance, data ingestion. However, centralized Azure monitoring might cause problems. The errors might only be stored in a database table.Other toolsI have concentrated on Databricks, Snowflake and partially Synapse technologies in my blogs.However, it is worth noting that the field between data warehouses and data lakes is bubbling. We get more and more hybrid solutions that have both data warehouse and data lake features meaning it is good to keep eyes open.Here are some examples:Firebolt, a direct competitor for Snowflake, is a data warehouse paradigm solution allegedly optimizing query performance. Apache Iceberg is a SQL query tool for data lake. Moreover, Apache Hudi and Apache Iceberg are alternatives to Databricks Delta file format. They all allow ACID transactions and incremental update for data lake files.ConclusionsI have dug deeper into technical questions related to cloud data projects, especially Snowflake and Databricks in Azure cloud. To conclude, DevOps kind of development process with cross-functional teams, code version control, reviewing and continuous deployment are beneficial.I have also discussed how to put these into use on technical level. This includes Infrastructure-as-Code tools, ways to review Spark or SQL code and so forth.We live interesting times in cloud data environment. The sea of technology is windy, and waves are high.

Sometimes foggy and rainy, so you really need to concentrate on driving. Sometimes you get a company in the car for a while, and then they get out again and you continue your road alone. But sometimes you get extra passengers whom you will have with you in your car hopefully for the rest of your life. Tiny little humans who are miniature versions of yourself. Who will accompany you on your trip and experience it with you. And what do you do when you have little ones in the back of your car? You drive a lot more carefully. You lower your speed, you do the turns more attentively, you must stop more often for breaks, and you do your utmost to make the trip as comfortable as possible. But the road hasn’t changed. The road can be still difficult, challenging, and at times downright dangerous. And by adding the responsibility sitting in the backseat, it will get hard. Because let’s face it, becoming a parent is a life-turning event, and is not to be taken lightly on.

That is, at the same time, a very scary and the best feeling in the world.Parenthood doesn’t end when the parental leave is overI am the father of three girls and a little dude, and I love it. It is in fact impossible to explain the feeling to someone who doesn’t have children, but the amount of unconditional love you get for these little versions of yourself is extremely intense. All parents know what I talk about. Now, in Norway, parental leave is something you are entitled to by law which every employer must adhere to. You get time completely off from your work, bonding with the child, and can then completely focus on the passengers in your life car.But in my experience, the critical period is the years after parental leave, when the kids are aged 2-7. The life road gets filled with bumps: day-care logistics, kids getting sick (seriously, they are sick A LOT the first years), and the everyday grind of having kids, and trying to keep the car on the life road all while trying to provide the best care you can for your younglings. In this phase of life, it is vital to have an employer who has the flexibility, and compassion in understanding that you might not be at the top of your game at your job after 3,5 hours of interrupted sleep, diaper changes, carrying, comforting, sitting at the bedside at 3:30 in the morning looking at a sick child with the stomach flu all while the washing machine is working overtime.Which comes first life or work?I mean one thing is little sleep when being young and ambitious of your own choice going on either three days party-stupor or working all night because you feel like it. It is something completely different when you get denied a full night of continuous sleep for literally years. There is a reason sleep deprivation is used as a torture method. I want to take this opportunity to thank Tietoevry for being an enabler and accommodator for me being a good parent as possible for the four little diamonds in my life. Being the age of 37, and after 16 years in the company, after spending close to half my life here this is where I grew up. And in all that time Tietoevry has been supporting me in all the twists, turns, bumps, and roundabouts in my life road. Both for the positive ones, and even the occasional motor breakdown and sliding off the road, my employer has always been there offering all the support they can. For that, I will be eternally grateful and will stay on board for at least 16 more years. And I send some thoughts to the 25-year-old me thinking: “sheesh, how hard could it be having small children?!” Well, young me, it’s REALLY hard. But thanks to an employer, who truly understands that the concept of life-work-balance is not only from a day-to-day basis but actually spans over years. It is hard in all the right ways.Would you like to join us? Check out our open positions!", Henning Starholm Steen ,Meet our people , 12.12.2022
"Flexible, sustainable, secure: why virtual cards make sense for all",/en/blog/2022/12/virtual-cards-flexible-sustainable-secure-for-all/,Sustainability / Henrik Brun / 12.12.2022,"Meanwhile, traditional bricks-and-mortar banks face a struggle to transform their banks for the digital era, moving from branch-based banking to full digital solutions.In a new white paper, Tietoevry explain why virtual cards are the perfect solution for this context. At present, e-commerce is growing many times faster than overall economic activity – around 17 percent per year globally, versus a world GDP growth estimate of 3.2% in 2022[1]. Within this, mobile devices are used most, with more than half of all e-commerce transactions in 2021 happening over cell phones, tablets and other devices[2].Virtual cards are low-cost, high-impact products that are more secure than plastic cards, improve the user experience and enhance a bank’s record on sustainability – all while offering the potential for greater flexibility in a digital future.The right choice for the digital eraDesigned to meet the needs of consumers in the digital world, virtual cards work exactly like physical cards, but exist in a digital wallet on the user’s phone. Virtual cards are distinct from digital cards, which copy a user’s physical bank card and store it on their mobile device, and “disposable cards” which are stored-value virtual cards designed for a single use.Virtual cards have their own unique card numbers secured by encryption, expiry dates, and cardholder verification code, or CVC. These CVC codes are extra-secure as they are dynamic, meaning they have a limited lifespan in terms of the length of time and number of transactions for which they can be used. Typically, dynamic CVC codes are single-use, meaning a fresh code is generated for each transaction to help security.Flexible and sustainableSecurity aside, virtual cards are also more flexible than their physical counterpart. They can be paired with other products inside a digital wallet, such as a loyalty scheme, a Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) option or a savings product. Issuing banks can invite clients to switch between virtual and physical versions of their cards according to need, for instance while waiting for a new physical card to arrive. Virtual cards also allow issuers to change their pricing strategies as required, for instance to promote sales or enter new markets. These features represent a step-change in terms of flexibility and convenience.Using no physical materials, virtual cards are environmentally-friendly, eliminating the use of plastics and rare earth metals in card production. What’s more, virtual cards use zero paper and packaging and have a much lower carbon footprint, since they are issued instantaneously over the air with no need for printing, paper and posting.As demand for sustainable banking solutions grows, virtual cards make sense – not just for the planet, but from a business perspective. With virtual cards, banks are offering their customers flexible, digital-first payments that can be adapted to meet the rapidly-developing requirements of the digital world.Download a free copy of Moving past plastic: why virtual cards make sense for everyone, the new white paper from Tietoevry, now.[1] See the International Monetary Fund, July 2022: “Global economic update”: https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2022/07/26/world-economic-outlook-update-july-2022[2] See Cell Phone Deal, “20 mind-blowing e-commerce statistics”: https://www.cellphonedeal.com/blog/20-mind-blowing-mobile-ecommerce-statistics", Henrik Brun ,Sustainability , 12.12.2022

Don’t rip and replace or how a SaaS solution allows flexibility when outsourcing,/en/blog/2021/11/3-dont-rip-and-replace-or-how-a-saas-solution-allows-flexibility-when-outsourcing/,Cloud / Toms  Jansons / 7.12.2022,"With the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce exploded in virtually all European markets in the peak of the first wave. The trend is predicted to continue as we are becoming an increasingly remote society.The phenomenon has its downsides, but at the same time these societal changes considerably boost payment processing and card transaction volumes, even in the otherwise slowed-down economy.Large number of brick-and-mortar stores are being forced out of business, with e-commerce and remote delivery being the only option moving forward. We can conclude that e-commerce is becoming more important than ever before; remote commerce is fast becoming a key revenue driver for many retail enterprises.Banks need new solutions to get into the acquiring business againDespite these recent tendencies, many EU banks have struggled to keep healthy margins and have outsourced or given away altogether their acquiring business. However, with the growth of e-commerce transaction volumes during the pandemic and new emerging payment methods, banks may find the e-commerce business lucrative again.We understand that any bank wishes to maintain relationships with clients. New payment methods deliver opportunities to re-capture customer data especially via e-commerce outlets.While this is an opportunity for banks to gain back their presence in the acquiring market, the initial investments, time, and effort required to implement an on-prem solution are a major limiting factor. While handing over your customer network to a processing centre is not the same as running your own solution.SaaS is a win-win for banks struggling with margins in the acquiring businessIn this situation, SaaS is uniquely positioned as you gain control over the solution – just as if it was your own. Yet you are relieved from the need to build hosting infrastructure, software deployment, servicing teams, and compliancy certification.The abovementioned also applies to card issuing. The market indicates that cards are here to stay and the tendencies show that issuers are now looking for market segments to drive revenue and profitability.To support new payment methods and follow market demand, there is no need to rip and replace the on-prem, in-house payment systems. You can add the benefits of SaaS and Cloud to your existing system as feasible modular replacement on a SaaS platform.Read more about Card and financial product solutions here.For more on public cloud vs private cloud solutions, please read blog series on Public cloud.", Toms  Jansons ,Cloud , 7.12.2022
Cloud services – a threat or opportunity?,/en/blog/2022/12/cloud-services--a-threat-or-opportunity/,Cloud / Maria Nordgren / 1.12.2022,"The geopolitical situation in our society, which is undergoing changes related to digitisation, has made cybersecurity questions critical across every organisation. Russia’s attack on Ukraine and Finland’s NATO membership discussions have raised the threat level for cyber attacks, but the threats materialise into business risks only if they are not prepared for accordingly.An unpredictable environment can be made safe if the risks and vulnerabilities are identified. In addition to safe technology, information security awareness, risk assessments and monitoring are needed in order to prevent business risks related to vulnerabilities in our systems.At the same time, the rapidly changing world places challenges on anticipation, as DoS attacks and ransomware, for example, are developing at the same rate as the technology and continuously changing regulation. We live in a situation where the new normal is that there is no normal. All of this makes the data service providers’ expertise and understanding of the global information security all the more significant.Constant change demands a new level of vigilance from organisations and people alike. We need to be able to anticipate and react quickly in order to secure the continuity of business even during potential crises.Who has access to the critical data? A carefully implemented risk assessment helps to safeguard the continuity of business during a crisis.Crisis-free cyber attackA cyber attack does not automatically constitute a crisis, but in the worst-case scenario, it can threaten the very existence of an entire organisation. Protecting the critical data and ensuring the continuity of essential business operations in an exceptional situation helps to minimise the potential damage.Computer programs are always susceptible to attacks, and the core functions of an organisation should never rely solely on them. An example of this is Denmark, where railway traffic had to be completely halted for several hours recently as a result of cyber attack, as there was no longer a manual option for overseeing the railway environment. When we take the necessary precautions and practise preparation, we can avoid panic even in dire circumstances.Cyber attacks should be seen as a flipside to the business opportunities arising from digitalisation and as part of an organisation’s normal everyday operations and risk management.In the wild modern landscape of cyber attacks, we should try to remember that not nearly all situations constitute a crisis. For DoS attacks, which hinder business operations, and ransomware with potential for major disasters, there are good ways of safeguarding the company from being completely devastated.When potential attacks have been prepared for in advance and the warning signs have been detected in time, operational reliability can be ensured even during a crisis.Simply focusing on the prevention of attacks is no longer sufficient due to the fact that the attacks are constantly becoming more and more advanced. It is extremely important that the system is monitored effectively in order to detect operations that deviate from the normal and that the necessary actions are taken on its basis in a timely manner.The balancing act of effective and safe developmentThe rapid rate of technological development and the continuously updated regulatory measures alongside it make preparing for information security issues very challenging. The pressure to adopt modern technologies that promote efficiency and to launch new business software may tempt organisations to take shortcuts with regard to security questions.Information security is created in the product development phase, and it cannot be added as an additional layer after the fact. In the future, the rush to develop applications may yet become a serious threat to business. Efficiency requirements and the actions of individual people are a much greater information security threat than the technology itself, although cybersecurity discussions are often focused on the technological aspect. We need a common mindset in securing development in accordance with the values of the European data economy.The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is aimed at securing citizens’ self-determination in the data market, but in the operational field dominated by the giants of the digital field from outside Europe, the regulation has proven to be insufficient. New ways of protecting critical data from ending up in the hands of outsiders are constantly being sought, but the solutions are not so simple.The safest choice may not necessarily be practical or even possible. Alongside the regulation, it would be crucial to have data management that is based on risk analysis, where the essential thing is to separate the critical data and place it in the optimal place from the perspective of both costs and security.According to Tietoevry’s Head of Cyber Security Maria Nordgren and Communications Coordinator Liisi Hatinen, improving information security in a company is a team effort.Public, private or sovereign cloud?Separating the critical data requires careful mapping of the risks as well as an understanding of the multidimensional nature of the constantly changing regulation and of the topical information security and cybersecurity issues.The starting point for risk analysis is to identify the most essential things from a business perspective and the threats that may expose the business to bankruptcy and to protect these by using robust defences. For instance, if ransomware prevents the shop’s cash register from being used and shuts the establishment down for multiple weeks during peak season, the business ends up in a state of crisis. The crisis must be prepared for in a preventive manner by making sure that cash payments can be received during potential attack situations, which will allow the establishment to keep its doors open, at least in some capacity.Tietoevry tailors cloud services to its customers based on risk assessments, so that the confidential data of Finnish organisations is managed and processed in a sovereign cloud within the Finnish borders, leaving outsiders no possibility to access it. Data is often placed in the public cloud due to functional reasons, and the confidentiality of the data and the results of the risk assessment are considered with regard to the relocated data. It should be clear that data should be protected appropriately, even if it is in the public cloud.In the sovereign cloud, information protection is centred around malware and access management. In the public cloud, the focus is on the analysis of users and activities that deviate from the normal. With our multi-cloud solutions, we make the choice easy for our customers – the data is protected according to its specific needs, regardless of what type of cloud solution is used.Knowledge leads to good resultsThe realisation of information security risks is typically tied to the individual’s lack of awareness and consideration. In the new global situation, the consequences of carelessness can be severe.Negligence due to laziness is a common occurrence in setting passwords and user IDs, locking of computers, handling of e-mail links and tending of business-related matters in public spaces. People need to be constantly reminded of the importance of vigilance. In addition to training, this could take the form of small security pointers when the screensaver is active.Information security risks often stem from the actions of individual people.In a world of cyber threats, knowledge improves security, and unconscious action is prevented through expertise. The responsibility for the risks always lies with the company itself, but the help of an experienced and certified professional is the surest way to avoid disaster.We help organisations find the balance between the level of information security, costs and the usability of services.Author, Mari Korhonen", Maria Nordgren ,Cloud , 1.12.2022
On data value with SAP data,/en/blog/2022/11/on-data-value-with-sap-data/,Data / Antti  Lyytikäinen / 30.11.2022,"S/4HANA changes this, and not only through tech. In this blog, we focus on how to increase the value of SAP data. If you wish to increase SAP data value, you need to first determine how to measure the value of data. We believe that the value of data can easily be calculated with the following formula:Data Value = Data Quality x (Data Utilization + Data Impact)What is our thinking behind this formula? Let’s first focus on the components in the formula: data quality, data utilization and data impact.Data QualityThis component consists of sub-components such as:Data consistency: Are your people, processes and source systems producing data with the defined content (dimensions & attributes)? If the answer is no, this is a core area that you should focus on in your S/4HANA business transformation.
Data reliability: Can you trust and understand the data, does it match with the source systems? Are the business rules and calculations correct and up to date?
Data reconciliation: Do you understand how the figures have been calculated, and do you understand what the values mean? Are the necessary data users capable of validating it?
Data traceability: Are you able to backtrack to all necessary source data through the end-to-end data value chain (e.g., ESG-policy requirements)?Data UtilizationThis component consists of sub-components such as:Data accessibility: Do you know where your data is? Is it possible to access it feasibly?
Data security: Do the defined access control and security policies cover data throughout all data pipelines? Do they match e.g., the same authorizations as in the ERP, so that there are no unintended audit breaches when ERP data is taken outside and under different authorization concepts?
Data culture: Is utilizing data part of your corporate culture? What is your business utilizing data for, what are the spearheads, what are all the different kinds of requirements that are far beyond just analytics as it’s all about the data pipelines in the enterprise architecture?
Data saturation: Have you been promoting and marketing your data solutions in your organization? Are people aware of your data solutions?Data ImpactThis component consists of sub-components such as:Decision making: Do you base your decision-making on data, or is it based more on instinct and gut feeling (business wisdom/experience)?
Vision and strategy: Do you take any actions based on the data? Is the data helping you to improve your processes and create concrete business benefits?
Measuring: Are you able to measure the impact that data has in your business? Do you have a process for this?
People: Are people happy to use data and do they trust the data? Does it make their workday easier?How to determine and increase Data ValueAs we all remember from our math lessons, something multiplied with zero is equal to zero. Thus, if any of the components in the formula is zero, is the value of your data zero?The answer is not that simple… In general, if data quality is causing headaches, it also means that there will be a lack of trust in data. If you improve your data quality, you will make it more valuable, and data usage will also increase. Then again, if you have world-class data, but nobody is using it, how valuable is it? Or if you have world-class data and it is utilized actively, but it has no proven impact on decision-making? Does this mean that your data is just fancy-looking eye candy?Even if you somehow end up in a situation where the formula gives you a zero result, there is still reason to believe that actually, your data is an asset that will give the expected value in the future.Maybe you just need to mould it into something informative and valuable with priorities and a roadmap built for data along with your S/4HANA journey, APIs, integrations, data lakes and wherever you need to take your SAP data to. Just remember to have a data architect role incorporated in your S/4HANA programs, so your architect can assist in planning this S/4HANA database and outward structure. And remember to put a lot of thought into how you can make the life of employees easier with real-time embedded analytics tied to user-designed workbenches and not just Fiori as the new GUI.The way to really improve the result of this formula is not tech, and most definitely not data lakes or DWs or dashboards. The key is taking the data requirements from a business perspective as a holistic topic within each process area of the S/4HANA design along with all of the non-functional areas that cover the whole architecture. Make sure you have a data architect to coordinate the work and link these efforts to the data management processes you may already have or are building.In essence, you need to ensure much closer cooperation between the data experts and SAP experts. You need to shift responsibilities and blow up any siloed thinking or pro-tech thinking. Your primary focus should be on making sense and benefiting the users. Rest assured, this can certainly be achieved when investing in S/4HANA for SAP data. If you follow the line of thinking that we presented above, you can improve your master data and data quality and implement data management processes at the same time as you build S/4HANA. It is the best time to do it - it gets harder if it’s an afterthought.", Antti  Lyytikäinen ,Data , 30.11.2022
Data as an Enabler part 2: Are you ignoring 80% of your data assets?,/en/blog/2022/11/are-you-ignoring-80-of-your-data-assets/,Data / Reija Nurmeksela / 30.11.2022,"However, according to IDC (source 1) only 20% of global data is predicted to live in databases as structured data in 2025. The rest, 80% of the data, resides outside of databases as semi-structured such as messages and unstructured such as documents.In all parts of organizations people send emails, use business applications, create contracts and tons of other documents, order goods and services, pay invoices. They browse websites and use mobile apps and machines that are connected to Internet for sending data to the service providers and manufacturers. And as a result, we create structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. It forms a complex data network, a business data web.Recognize and automateUnlocking the value of unstructured and semi-structured data would give you a holistic insight of your business environment, most importantly about customers and their needs. In addition, recognizing this data would give a great steppingstone to automate your business activities.Automating the handling of unstructured data and converting parts of it into structured data would reduce routine tasks and at the same time, increase efficiency in business activities making the everyday work life of people even smoother.Let’s take an example. Interactions with customers and stakeholders are often in unstructured or semi-structured forms. For example, your customer or business partner contacts you with an email or sends you a document. It is common that customer name, document type and other data about the business transaction are copied manually from emails and documents and pasted into business systems.We can improve digital information supply chains, like above, with a variety of solutions that help us to utilize all forms of data in various business and data domains. Modern automation and content service solutions, data platforms, and recent development in computational linguistics, machine learning and AI provide better technology base to utilize all forms of data in large scale. As a result, traditionally separated categories of structured and unstructured data – latter known better as “content” – are gradually colliding and uniting.And when data moves, there is also semi-structured data that creates a transfer framework for the data. Thus, there is a need to build organizational competencies that understand the intersection of various forms of data.At the end of year 2021, there were close to five billion global internet users (source 2) connected to the web of data. The volume of data produced in the world is practically doubling every 18 months. It is estimated that there will be 180 zettabytes of data in 2025 (source 3). In addition, the variety of data is expanding: the sources and users of data are heterogeneous and calling out to focus increasingly on all forms of data.Find your own path to data-driven businessSo, how can your organization become data-driven – an organization where decision-making is based on structured, semi-structured and unstructured data and where the automatic flow between structured, semi-structured and unstructured data is a natural part of everyday work of people and systems?Here are my three tips:1 Secure your structured dataIt is said that data is the world’s most valuable and the same time most vulnerable resource. Structured databases are large collections of your critical data enabling your business. Interests to harm and monetize your data makes them so vulnerable.Identify the most critical and purposeful data for your business, and how the data is inserted and used in your business activities. These are the most critical data activities in your business.
 Focus on your critical data items that overlap between, not only numerous databases of business systems, but also unstructured documents and semi-structured messages. These should be in focus when thinking about automating your data flows in digital information supply chains.
 Assess your data storages and processing environment from privacy and cybersecurity point of views, particularly to guarantee that only authorized persons and systems can add, modify and delete the data.2 Give up of the A4 tradition of documents and automate content creationOrganizations are digitalizing and transforming their document-centric processes and workflows towards AI-supported orchestration and decisioning. IDC predicts that by 2026, 75% of the largest enterprises in the world have completely digitalized their unstructured data processes (source 4).Identify work processes that rely heavily on unstructured documents and integrate document ingestion solutions with business systems. These are the unstructured data activities where you should reduce paper-based work and reliance on manual efforts.
 Rethink whether the form of digital business information for human use could be something more dynamic than unstructured PDF document in A4 format. Could it be visualized as dashboards or visually flexible combinations of text and images on modern websites and mobile apps? Turning your unstructured data to semi-structured gives better user experiences on devices such as smart phones.
 Content of business documents consists of structured data from databases, reused content and new content. Gartner has predicted that by 2024, 80% of new documents and correspondence will contain recycled content and content added via auto-completion (source 5). Connecting structured and unstructured data and automated document creation reduce routine tasks and decreases errors caused by manual data copying.3 Move your semi-structured data fast and securelyThe emergence of websites, mobile applications and IoT has multiplied the amount of semi-structured data. Nowadays, vast amount of data pipelines extract, transfer, and load data for reporting and real-time data stream.Identify the data streams that are critical to building responsive business processes and rich customer experiences in real-time. Is the data moving fast enough? What if the data would be available for data analysis and other needs with less motion as it is in the modern cloud data platforms? The more you move your data from one location to another, the harder it becomes to secure, protect and guarantee the integrity of your data.
 Identify business transactions where the same data is duplicated or multiplied for several flows. For example, as long as digital or even paper documents are used in business transactions, same data flows between business applications and systems in more than one form and format, such as semi-structured JSON parallel to unstructured PDF or image. Useless data transfer is not only a security issue but affects negatively to energy consumption.How about cooperation between business and IT people?All data forms have their own special characteristics, which require specific expertise of business and use context as well as technical means and tools. Knowing these characteristics is important also for businesspeople because business not only owns the data, but also the flow of data between different data forms in business activities.So, the connection between structured, semi-structured and unstructured data always requires cooperation between data, IT and business. It is great to see that many businesspeople are busy building their data literacy skills and better ability to “think data”.Diving deep into your unique business data journey might still be difficult, particularly as it requires tight cooperation between technology and business-oriented people and a common language over business and data that everybody understands.If you need advice, business and data consultants can guide you and your organization to become data-driven. In my work, I help customers to identify connections, critical data items and flows between different data forms and various business systems when modernizing data handling in business processes.If you like to remember one key takeaway about building cohesive base for decision-making from all forms of data, it is this:“Don’t try to separate data and information and content. They are becoming so integrated and so ingrained in one another. There’s really a lot of overlap, so don’t try too hard to separate out structured and unstructured information because really, it’s all just data.”- Expert Panel PerspectivesAIIM - The Association for Intelligent Information Management (source 6)The ABC of structured, semi-structured and unstructured dataIn the following, I will highlight some of the most common business applications and go through key features of various data forms.Your business is based on technological systems supporting your and your customers´ business activities, such as:CRM for your customer relationship management,
 PIM for managing your products,
 ERP for planning your enterprise resources wisely,
 SCM for supporting delivery chain to your customers,
 CM for managing cases and documents in content intensive businesses,
 CMS for managing content on web sites and content marketing,
 DM and RM for supporting life cycle of your documents and business records,
 Accounting systems for tracking income and expenses,
 HRM for supporting human resource activities, as well as many more advanced systems to support various business needsLet´s dive a bit deeper to the data forms that are living inside and between these various data domains, systems, and applications.Structured data: This is data for business transactions thatlocates in relational databases of operative business applications, such as CRM, PIM, ERP, SCM, or CM, in on-premises or cloud environments,
 follows predefined data models and schemas, and thus are quite straightforward to create, utilize and analyse. However, in my experience data level variations in data definitions and values between different business applications must be considered seriously in practical data projects,
 consists of clearly defined data types with patterns that should make them easily searchable with various tools and technologies,
 is typically machine (software application) generated data,
 has in many cases long life cycle but the life cycle varies a lot from temporary to permanent.Unstructured data: This means documents and content created as business records or for other human interaction. The datamay locate in file folders, non-relational databases, as blob entities (Binary Large Object) in relational and other databases, web sites, social media platforms,
 is technically defined as data in absolute raw form e. binary data,
 is not structured via predefined data models or schema, but has an internal structure that requires cognitive capabilities (human or AI) for understanding of that structure,
 is mainly human generated data, but generation by software and artificial intelligence applications is increasing,
 requires advanced search capabilities and proper software application for visual or auditory presentation of the data,
 varies a lot according to its life cycle, from temporary to permanent.
 in many cases is redundant, for instance, consists of many versions, presentation formats, copies, and variants.Semi-structured data: This is sensor data, application logs, messages, excel sheets and structured content for data interchange such as Json and xml files thatmay locate in IoT streams, file folders, non-relational databases, as blob entities (Binary Large Object) in relational databases,
 is structured via predefined syntax but in many cases may lack predefined schema,
 is mainly machine generated data, but also humans may generate structured content for example when content authoring is based on structured (xml) documents
 typically requires proper software application for data creation and processing
 has typically short and temporary life cycle except in case of structured (xml) documents.Data as an enabler blog seriesIn this blog series, me and my colleagues provide perspectives to understand data as an enabler for digital business.

3 facts to consider when evaluating SaaS model for payments processing,/en/blog/2021/11/3-facts-to-consider-when-evaluating-saas-model-for-payments-processing/,Cloud / Vjaceslavs Sorokins / 30.11.2022,"We listed some of the limitations that businesses should take into account when choosing between SaaS model and own IT systems.1. Availability of IT professionalsIt has been an increasing struggle within the IT industry to attract and source expert talent and to maintain employee retention. Availability does vary depending on geographical region, but overall, it is safe to state that globally, the demand for IT workforce will only increase.As a result of shortage of IT professionals, companies find themselves building two business plans: one for their primary product and another for themselves, promoting their employer reputation and creating strategies to cope with the constant need for new IT employees.2. Stringent requirements towards system availabilitySoftware systems face ever-increasing availability requirements, as instant payment processing becomes a commodity. The demand for increasingly high uptime brings a new level of complexity into entire software solution stack.Every single component of the system (both software and infrastructure) must be redundant, hot-swappable, and multi-node. This puts extra pressure on IT department during design, implementation, and operational/maintenance phases, and does require higher qualification of IT employees.3. Visibility into and control over IT costsBusiness owners often find themselves struggling to control the exponentially growing IT costs. This is a direct result from lack of transparency that is caused by the ever-increasing complexity of IT systems. It is impossible to predict the size of upcoming investments, as the IT industry brings new and increasingly expensive solutions into the market daily.One might think that SaaS brings a much higher cost compared to on-prem solution. But that is not true when taking into account hardware, software, labour, administrative, and utility costs, combined with procedural and compliancy requirements. This is especially so when software deployment, processed data volumes, and teams maintaining, operating, and developing the IT solution begins to grow. One cannot expect to be as cost-competitive as companies that specialize in SaaS service provision.The aim of a business owner is to focus on its product, rather than spending time on back-end IT systems. This is reflected by preferred format of cost reporting that is intended to show overall cost per business metric (e.g. cost per card, authorization, payment), rather than diving into individual cost items on a technical level. But that is not feasible from the moment one starts to look for cost optimization, even though it would be way more convenient to isolate oneself from the technical complexity and operate exclusively within business realm.Assuming that SaaS model would solve the abovementioned issues, requirement to have control over the solution is still actual – even if hosting, operations, and maintenance of the solution are outsourced. However, when chosen based on evaluation of customer-orientation, solid growth, and strategy, the SaaS provider can become a long-term partner, walking the business growth path together with you.Benefits of SaaS in a nutshell:SaaS removes all the technical complexity
Costs are transparent and typically measured using metrics directly linked with the company’s primary business
The company can concentrate on building their core business and focus on the product without the complex details of the technical solution
SaaS relieves the impact of IT workforce sourcing ability as one of the product success factors.For further benefits of moving payments processing to SaaS model, see our next blog post: “What sets SaaS apart from on-prem and processing centre solutions in the payments space?”", Vjaceslavs Sorokins ,Cloud , 30.11.2022
Acquire customers in cost-efficient way with Top Up Recommender,/en/blog/2022/11/acquire-customers-in-cost-efficient-way-with-top-up-recommender/,Data / Anton  Sobolev / 29.11.2022,"Over the past decade, the recognition of what AI can bring to a business has risen dramatically across all industries, and banking is no exception. Consequently, we have seen a greater degree of awareness interest in this field, from banks as they work proactively to get an AI advantage from our solutions, in addition to the ideas and services we provide.LENDING LIFECYCLETypically, in a banks’ loan process a large percentage of resources and expenditure towards acquiring customers and defining suitable loan conditions for each potential client to step in (take a loan) and deliver sufficient profit. (You can see our other posts to get an idea about such products). Ideally, however, to optimize the customer experience and profitability, this process should continue throughout the whole customer loan lifecycle. Analyzing data on customers’ payment habits and how they evolve over time, serves to indicate certain changes in a customer’s needs. With a Top-up Recommender in place, we predict a customer’s need to apply for a larger loan and thereby proactively make a suitable offer.TOP-UP OR NOT?A top-up loan is implemented into the current loan, so that the loan amount is raised and maturity time extended. This approach is usually preferable over taking a separate loan, due to lower maintenance costs for one loan as opposed to multiple loans. Despite its name, our Top-up Recommender works in both cases, i.e., for offering additional loans to suitable customers, either as a top-up or a second loan.ADDRESSING YOUR OBJECTIVESIn addition to being easily implementable, the Top-up Recommender brings the following quantitative benefits:1. When a customer decides they need another loan, they may make simultaneous applications at various banks to find the most competitive offer. There is a risk they may even decide to transfer their current loan to another bank. switching to competitors.2. In addition to avoiding unnecessary costs and losses, a favorable top-up loan will enhance the revenues from the customer, increasing their individual ROI.WORKFLOWAs soon as a new customer is acquired, their payment behavior and other available information on the customer is regularly processed (e. g. monthly), to forecast their need for a top-up loan (also referred to as “credit hungriness”). Once a customer is recognized as someone who has a high likelihood of applying for a top-up loan, a multidimensional optimization problem is run with the aim of maximizing the potential extra profits available. The outcomes are:Optimal top-up loan amount  
Optimal interest rate  
Optimal maturity timeGETTING STARTEDBased on our experience of deploying AI powered services, we’ve put emphasis on scalability. This eases the onboarding process, so that no matter which internal systems and technologies you utilize, Top-up Recommender can be easily implemented without costly investments.It’s time to start using data to its full potential and thereby save costs, improve the customer experience and achieve your targets.

Making an impactful change with DEI,/en/blog/2022/11/making-an-impactful-change-with-dei/,Sustainability / Hanna Vuorikoski / 28.11.2022,"I believe that diversity and inclusion are crucial in creating an inspirational workplace and enabling innovation for years to come. And we do not see equality as something that can be achieved once, only to be forgotten later on. Tietoevry actively works internally, with partners and wider communities to foster equality in both the workplace and society at large.Last spring, we carried out a study with alarming results – only 15 percent of female students from the age of 15 to 25 in Norway and Finland consider education or a career in tech. Half of the girls replying in the survey consider a career in tech to be boring or complicated.We want to clear up misconceptions regarding the technology industry and to portray the diverse and fascinating career opportunities it offers. There are unique opportunities far from boring: solving climate change, building health tech, or launching the next TikTok –, you name it. They all need more women and girls to get involved.Inklusiiv founder Katja Toropainen presenting survey results (photo: Inklusiiv)Read the full report: DEI in the Nordic VC Industry – perceptions, realities and the way forwardThe race for top talentIn the Nordics, we already have a shortage of tech experts, and the demand will only grow in the coming years. And it is not only about programming and developer roles. We also need people in non-technical positions: user experience and interface designers, recruiters, sales and marketing professionals, and project and product managers.Another issue to solve is the state of diversity among people who create digital services, tools, and applications for wide audiences. Understanding the needs of different users and use cases equals better products and design, but a team of like-minded people is more prone to overlook viewpoints outside of their own. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure different people from a multitude of backgrounds are working in technology.The skills shortage threatens economic growth and green transitionWhen you observe the world around you, it’s easy to see how technology is becoming more and more intertwined with all aspects of our lives. Therefore, understanding technology allows you to have an impact on the things that you truly care about.People that work in technology often have diverse backgrounds and skills. Having a diverse team is a great asset, as the best ideas are often created when great minds that don’t think alike work together.At Tietoevry, we see the diversity of people, beyond sex, gender identification, ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, sexual orientation, or age equally valuable and create a good and inspirational workplace. Embracing every individual creates a culture, where everyone can flourish and reach their full potential.I got an opportunity to join a panel discussion on driving DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion – in tech at Slush side event by Inklusiiv. We were challenged to bring some new concrete ideas to the table but sometimes a handful of old tricks are better than a sackful of new ones. Ambitious and courageous targets, systematic actions and focus on communication will drive a more diverse and inclusive workplace for us all – (slowly but surely.)Making an impactful change with DEI panel discussion at Inklusiiv side event at Slush (photo: Inklusiiv)What could we do to speed up the change?Target setting. As a concrete target to advance equality – we have set an ambition to reach 40% share of female professionals globally by 2026 – and 50% by 2030 – corresponding to 29% today.
Recruitment. Expand female recruitment, build on graduate recruitment, and ensure final candidates of both genders when recruiting internally and externally.
Job ads. Words stand in the way of women in tech: A simple change in recruitment ads significantly increased women applicants.
Successor planning. Ensure that there is a successor from both genders for all positions in all manager-level succession plans.
Unconscious bias. We all have unconscious biases that we can learn to recognize and then actively work to tackle them.
Role models. Our survey showed that parents, friends, and media have an essential role when young women and girls are choosing careers and education.", Hanna Vuorikoski ,Sustainability , 28.11.2022

Previously, he spent 12 years with Nokia Siemens Networks honing his managerial skills in different IT positions, as well as working for both Valuemotive and Tietoteekki.His current role in software engineering delivery management sees him allocated to customer programs in both the private and public sectors, such as leading the development of a lifesaving, mission-critical system for a security authority.“My days are full of servant leadership where the main goal is to ensure that all customer program members have the means to do their job successfully. I measure the progress of the program, analyse risks and ensure that the job matches with the customer’s needs.”Planting a seed for successTeppo admits that his career path has almost happened by accident, propelled by a desire to accept new professional challenges.“When an opportunity appears, you must make the decision quickly. If you overthink, you will lose it.”His passion for self-improvement and a dogged determination to satisfy his curiosity has led him to organize several project management and leadership training days around Helsinki as a hobby, sharing his positive thoughts and encouraging approach to being a leader with others.“My approach is not to give answers but to plant a seed that will lead to people starting to think for themselves. In project management and life, there is no black and white, right or wrong. There are many ways to achieve a good result.

A new project means familiarizing myself with a customer’s strategy, portfolio and values, as well as becoming acquainted with many new people and learning how to best manage them.”Building a supportive cultureA popular management theory for leadership success is good cooperation among professionals and it has inspired Teppo to launch the Delivery Community initiative at Tietoevry Create.“If we want to succeed, we should have an environment in which we can share, acknowledge and practice the skills needed in our profession. Success is about breaking down silos.”One of the first developmental steps has been the creation of a safe environment for project managers, service managers and salespeople to test ideas internally, gaining feedback and confidence before presenting them to a customer.“We have wonderful and talented people here at Tietoevry Create, so we should enable a supportive, coaching and information-sharing culture.

SAP Cloud from the ground up,/en/blog/2022/11/sap-cloud-from-the-ground-up/,Cloud / Antti  Heinonen / 24.11.2022,"With SAP pushing the “RISE with SAP S/4HANA” message so forcefully, it could easily be interpreted as a clear EITHER/OR situation. Either you get on board with the RISE program or you stick to the way you have traditionally been running SAP for as long as it is technically possible. The divider is very much how you approach the foundation of your build.“SAP RISE with SAP S/4HANA” is the transformation as a service package that helps modernize your platform infrastructure by embracing Cloud as the vehicle for your next-generation ERP applications. At face value, it entails handing over the responsibility for managing operations to SAP, but as an alternative, you can choose to remain in control, while still operating on a cloud model.What can be confusing is the terminology, as Public Cloud comes with different connotations depending on who is delivering the message. In the SAP RISE world, you can choose between Public Cloud and Private Cloud as “flavours” of SAP S/4HANA Cloud. The latter technically branches out from the On-Premise application stem, but if we focus on the trail down to the foundation, we find that both solutions rest on hyperscaler infrastructure.In the world outside SAP RISE, this is known as the Public Cloud. The Private Cloud on the other hand is the kind of infrastructure service provided by someone like Tietoevry to run your SAP environments in one of our data centres. Clearly, we have a situation where there is bound to be confusion when discussing this topic unless you are crystal clear on what “Cloud” you are referring to. Going forward in this piece “Public Cloud” is synonymous with the hyperscaler offering a-k-a Public Cloud Infrastructure.Not depicted in the drawing is the RISE with SAP S/4HANA Private Edition – Customer Datacenter Option (or PE-CDC) where “cloud” is used loosely to include what is essentially an Any Prem-deployment.Judging by market trends it is clear the future is in the public cloud for the majority of companies, and we would argue that the number will grow as the public cloud providers expand their sovereign cloud offerings to meet specific demands for managing data within specific borders. But as we are not there yet, there is clearly a demand for options when it comes to hosting SAP solutions.A recent survey among 434 companies in the German-speaking SAP User Group (DSAG) concludes:“As before, on-premise systems remain extremely important, even if cloud solutions are gaining on them. This confirms a trend that has been apparent for several years now: the future of IT is hybrid!”Whether you can extrapolate this statement to other markets might be up for debate, but regardless, the transition to the cloud for core business applications might take a while, and there is a need for options in the meanwhile.At Tietoevry we have engineered several foundations to be able to cater to different customer needs. At one end of the spectrum, we have our Tietoevry Dynamic Landscape (TDL) offering for running your SAP solutions in our own state-of-the-art datacenters and at the other end, we offer the SAP on Public Cloud solution where we manage your Azure or AWS environment for SAP. In addition, we also offer services in an “SAP RISE Private Cloud Edition”-context for those functions that can be managed by customers and partners. Collectively we refer to these different foundations simply as SAP Platforms.Follow the link for more detailed descriptions of our offerings.A common denominator for these services is the fundamental skillset in SAP Basis with the addition of Cloud Architecture. At Tietoevry these skills are often combined with individual advisors which benefit our customers when moving from the Private Cloud to the Public Cloud. In total, we have around 1200 global SAP specialists bringing the full package of consulting and application management services on top of these technology-related offerings.Regardless of whether you prefer the Private Cloud or the Public Cloud as the foundation for your build, we at Tietoevry have you covered. And if you are unsure what is the best fit for your SAP building, feel free to reach out and let us explore the options together.", Antti  Heinonen ,Cloud , 24.11.2022
A Business approach in Project Management,/en/blog/2022/11/best-practice-to-succeed-with-project-management/,Digitalization / Håkan Johnsson / 24.11.2022,"We have been trained for this and have both the processes, methodology and experience in our toolbox to use in our assignments. But there is also another important aspect and success factor that I want to highlight - to have a business approach in project management, regardless of type of project.In project manager assignments and in pre-studies, it is an advantage to have a business approach, as the changes you are leading and implementing almost always have improvement and efficiency as the goal.A company's goal is, in principle, always growth and increased profitability. Good IT and operational support are prerequisites and means to achieve this. Keeping this in mind will help you understand the customer's priorities.As a project manager, it is usually a must to familiarize yourself with the customer's business, both to understand how the assignment or project you are assigned to implement contributes to the company's goals, and to enter the customer's world and gain an understanding of the management's and employees' goals and aspirations.In this article I will go through different parts of the project manager assignment and share my personal best practicesCustomer's business
The assignment
Implementation
Way of Working
Leadership and Communication
My personal experiencesCustomer’s businessIn my experience, the best way to familiarize yourself with a company's operations is to read about, ask about and have explained how the customer's business works, what operational and strategic goals the company has, what is produced, how it is marketed and sold, etc. With that knowledge, you can better keep up in discussions and understand what is happening within the company and in the market in which the customer operates.You will also get an insight into how the results to be produced in the assignment will contribute to the company's goals, and can thereby make sure to deliver the right ""product"" and ensure the solutions proposed are in line with the company’s goals. During presentations and in dialogues, you can then show your knowledge, show that you have gained insight and want to contribute to improvements, and that is popular.So, familiarize yourself with the customer's processes, how the business works, how information flows, how budget and follow-up, sales, marketing, production, delivery and support work. This is important information about the company that you will benefit from in your assignment, and that will help you understand the company’s needs.Most companies have a documented ""customer journey"" which is good to familiarize yourself with. That knowledge is important to use in dialogues in the assignment, it creates trust and shows that you are interested and familiar with the business.It is also important to understand what the company offers its end customers or dealers, and how the customer meeting works. Familiarizing yourself with the customer's market is just as important. What are the trends in the market, what challenges exist, who are the competitors and how does the customer compare.Make sure you understand the company's operations, market and customers, and the mechanisms that affect profitability, performance and well-being. By communicating the ""right way"" and with the ""right language"", you can translate your knowledge into benefit and value for the customer.The AssignmentFeel free to do a little extra in your delivery, but not too much. The customer should get what they pay for, but it’s a good idea to show that you have more to offer. This can hopefully lead to an expansion or extension of the assignment, or that colleagues can enter assignments with the customer.Try to find key values that can be followed up and can point to successful achievements in your assignment. It’s important to highlight the value-creating activities and initiatives that support the company's goals and vision.Don’t go bragging about other assignments that you had, be humble and formulate your experiences as having ""worked with similar issues in previous assignments"". Even if you have encountered exactly the same problem before, the solution may not be the same, as the circumstances, the company and the people are different and may have different goals and priorities.In general, it is important to adapt the customer’s routines to the assignment and project making life easier for the customer, this is appreciated. But don’t hesitate to suggest improvements to routines if they can be easily implemented, this might be a good merit for you.Make sure you manage follow-up, planning and budgeting for your project or assignment yourself. This makes it easier for the customer and you get control over your area of responsibility. After all, you are the one with the best information and knowledge in your assignment or project.Understanding the customer's financial processes is also important, and ensuring that the project's routines for follow-up, budgeting and outcome follow the processes.Sometimes it may be appropriate to take care of a business area or activities and lead them on behalf of the client, it can be a good way to show off your skills and to build trust.ImplementationPreferably ask open questions when interviewing the customer's employees and other persons. You will surely get the important answers you need when you are new and in need of information. Most people like to talk, to teach and to show their knowledge. Ask for details towards the end and summarize to check you understood correctly. Be an active listener, give thanks for the information and make sure to have the opportunity to come back with more questions if needed.Make sure to use the good thoughts, ideas and suggestions that come from the customer's employees. Those who work operationally in the business often have good ideas and suggestions for improvement, but their ideas don't always reach management, so you can support here.Utilize the employee’s improvement suggestions and present them to the management at the right time. Don’t make the suggestions out to be your own, instead be open with who came up with the suggestions, so the customer understands they have good knowledge and abilities internally to care for. Always leave feedback on the suggestions to those who made them, it is appreciated and builds trust.Be open and take the time to talk to everyone at the customers company, employees, managers, and company management. Make sure you stay informed about what's going on, how the company is doing, what's happening, staff changes, etc. By showing interest, you build trust, gain knowledge about the business and the staff, get to know moods and other important insights for your assignment.Way of WorkingHave a risk-based mindset in the dialogue with customers and clients. It’s good to point out opportunities, but also remember to mention the risks associated with them. Make the customer aware of the risks, but don’t exaggerate them, and remember to emphasize the potential for improvement.Make sure always to create fact based decision documents for decisions to be made. Documents should include proposal, alternatives, impact of implementation, consequences of referring and a financial calculation.Perform regular follow-ups, retros, of what has been carried out in the project to evaluate the benefit. Involve customer's staff and decision-makers in evaluations and report the outcome in the steering group.Show your experience and your methods knowledge, but beware of coming across as a “know-it-all”. Having managed a similar project or assignment for another customer does not mean you are an expert. Conditions, personnel, management, and company's priorities are always unique with each new assignment.Be sure to join in and embrace the culture of the customer. Attend meetings, lunches, coffee, etc. and talk to the staff, it means a lot. Think about clothing, style, working hours and how you want to be perceived by the customer.Be sure to familiarize yourself with the project methodology and working methods used. For customers who do not have a specific methodology, you need to figure out which methodology would work best and suggest it, or some alternative way of working. It is your task to contribute to good order.Leadership and CommunicationIn my experience, a situational leadership is what works best when you come to a new customer and have to lead people you don't know. You must first ""get to know"" the people and the company before choosing how the activities should be managed so you don't end up in a clinch or is perceived as doing noting.Thanks to good communication skills and collaborative way of working, you build trust with others. This, in combination with a prestige-free and pragmatic approach, provide the keys to succeed as a project manager.Communicating a lot is important, as is providing the right information to the various stakeholders at the customers company and to external stakeholders. It’s very important to spend time on communication, internally and externally to demonstrate the benefits that will be achieved by your work.My personal experiencesThe approach and way of working described has been working well for me and, most of it will most likely work well for you too. It has contributed to succeeding in my assignments and projects, and my efforts as a project manager being appreciated by customers and project members during the years.Håkan is an IPMA C-certified Project Manager, a Certified Scrum Master and a Certified Leading SAFe Agilist.Do you want to know more about project management?

Reflections on Slush 2022,/en/blog/2022/11/tietoevry-veturi-slush-2022-experience/,Digitalization / Ksenia Avetisova / 24.11.2022,"Having experienced Slush more than 10 times over the years, in different capacities – as a student, as a service designer, as a demo owner, an investor seeker and as representative of the large company - I feel like I have uncovered quite many layers of opportunities that this platform brings.Together with colleagues from Tietoevry, this year we raised the topics of ecosystem building and fortification. As one of the Locomotive Companies, Tietoevry has an important role in the Nordic market to facilitate the creation and growth of strong long-lasting collaborative business models. The mission of the Tietoevry locomotive initiative titled Trusted Digital Societies is to develop affordable, accessible and trusted digital services for citizens.By the end of the Slush 2022 experience a few things became very clear:Despite the geo-political environment affecting Europe and global markets, the amount of funding and willingness to invest in early-stage ideas has been growing. The access to capital and support that comes with it from experienced teams is available for entrepreneurs who set out to change the world. This has been evident also on the local Finnish level via the amount of co-innovation applications submitted to Business Finland by our ecosystem partners.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion as well as specifically gender balance are very important topics for organizations of all sizes and backgrounds. We searched for a working model in terms of attracting more diverse team members to the ecosystem in order to create truly futureproof and inclusive digital solutions for the citizens. However, yet until this day, there are no silver bullets. It is the responsibility of every single actor to make things happen and spark change. A beautiful example originates from Tietoevry, an IT girl campaign that encourages young girls to raise their confidence level and take on roles in the IT sector.
Focusing on sustainability and changing the world for good are among the top drivers in investors’ decisions. This year more than ever, conversations with start-up founders and investors alike raised the importance of considering how solutions impact overall positive developments in the world, starting from the local community. We met a lot of brilliant entrepreneurs driving change in the areas of finance, healthcare and energy and skilfully using disruptive technology to achieve their ambitious goals. And that’s exactly where the power of ecosystem and co-creation comes to play an important role – together we can accelerate the best innovation becoming available to larger audiences.Trusted Digital Societies ProgrammeHaving launched the program only at the beginning of the year we have been eagerly looking forward to Slush sharing the opportunities we identified with the younger companies and startup teams. Together with our existing and new ecosystem partners, we aim to accelerate the development of trusted technologies and technological know-how. As a multinational company, our strength is the ability to help Finnish IT companies to build globally scalable business value from responsible data-enabled platforms.This programme is part of a Business Finland funded initiative to solve some of society’s most pressing challenges through increased research, development, and innovation investments in Finland. Tietoevry is inviting partners to join the ecosystem for research collaboration.Fill out the short form and our team will be in touch.Images: People listening to the Trusted Digital Societies presentation at the Tietoevry booth, Iftikhar Ahmad meeting startuppers, and Ksenia Avetisova enjoying the Slush atmosphere.", Ksenia Avetisova ,Digitalization , 24.11.2022
Sovereign cloud stands out as a major trend at VMware Explore Europe 2022,/en/blog/2022/11/sovereign-cloud-stands-out-as-a-major-trend-at-vmware-explore-europe2022/,Data / Alberto Valero / 23.11.2022,"Tietoevry was present in two panel discussions on How Sovereign Cloud partners are Addressing Market and Customer Needs & Data Sovereignty in the Cloud Provider landscape, highlighting the various challenges of data sovereignty and how they are overcome.Yours truly and Francisco Romero, Head of Sovereign Cloud Service offering were present in these discussions where we covered the maturity of Sovereign Cloud, including customer perspectives and competence, as well as portfolio expansion with Sovereign Solutions, and each partner including Tietoevry gave their perspective on Sovereign Cloud in their region and how they are leading the industry in their respective regions.Tietoevry also contributed with a breakout session presenting a concrete customer case; Norrbotten county municipalities have been able to start their journey by putting the right data in the right cloud with the right level of sovereignty. The full attendance in them was fully engaged throughout the session, and there was no doubt that a need for this kind of solution resonates in the market.This customer case was also presented at Radar Summit 2022 in Stockholm, the Nordic’s most important meeting place for Tech and IT latest trends, during the same week with good engagement from the audience.Here are my key takeaways from Sovereign Cloud-related topics generally from the conference in Barcelona:According to what the CEO of VMware, Raghu Raghuram, stated in his keynote: As organisations notice multi-cloud environment provides them a choice of clouds—sovereign and global—in which to run their apps, they’ve encountered a big spike in complexity, security challenges, and a skills shortage. Despite the challenges, organizations have accelerated multi-cloud use, adopting a “Cloud Smart” approach, with flexibility and choice across multiple clouds would be a natural next step. Cloud-smart organisations have benefitted from their multi-cloud operations noting their enhanced competitiveness and top-line results.There is no data sovereignty without cloud sovereignty. And sovereignty does not have to come at the expense of cloud innovation,” said Rajeev Bhardwaj, vice president, cloud provider platform solutions, VMware. “With our new sovereign cloud innovations, we’re again setting the agenda by bringing SaaS services into sovereign environments. This will enable customers innovate and drive digital transformation while reducing the risk of unlocking the value of data.
VMware promises that sovereign cloud services will continue to see expansion through its cloud partners, to ease the process of maintaining data compliance and data protection across cloud servicesHarnessing all the power of the cloud. In a Nordic way, the sovereign wayWe have now established foundational sovereign cloud capabilities in our Nordic data center network for our customers and are actively taking existing and new customers to this new modern solution.According to a new research conducted by VMware reveals that during the next two years, 96% of all companies surveyed expect data will be a source of income, with 50% believing it would be a substantial revenue source. As economic uncertainty grows, it's no surprise that more corporate executives are focusing on data as an untapped revenue stream. However, the disadvantage is equally significant: respondents ranked data sovereignty as one of the key challenges facing organizations with 95% admitting it is a concern. Organisations that fail to comply with data-sovereignty requirements sometimes face fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars, as well as brand reputation harm as a result of data breach. Today, over 100 countries have their own rules defining how data should be maintained and retained within their borders, and the majority of these policies are continually changing.

Sustainable incremental steps(actions) planningWhen your As-Is and To-Be state images are drawn, another essential factor that needs to be associated with these images is the underline implicit expectation of sustainable incremental steps(actions), which is needed to achieve the To-Be state, just like any puzzle-solving game.Basically, what are the needed steps for setting governance, methodology, guidelines, templates, migrations, deployments assessments, and best practices to minimize disruption to the current delivery.The essence of this frame is to identify what is good in your existing business, to realize what needs to innovate on top of existing assets, how to run your business and IT in co-existence mode and create the bridge to keep on running existing applications while setting up the new ones.This means the enhancement of the To-Be state image and your sustainable incremental transformation of the As-Is application landscape will be parallel, i.e., changes to the image and incremental journey milestones suitable to your priorities and existing IT landscape will be synchronized.To conclude - In this frame, you document and track the sustainable incremental steps(actions) that needs to be taken to achieve the To-Be state.6. High-level roadmapBased on all the work done until now, we are ready to draw a high-level roadmap.It is vital to draw a high-level roadmap simple enough to understand at a high level and then add complexity to the roadmap based on organizational needs.Many organizations try to add elements like the below examples in the roadmap frameworkSynchronize forms of technology and business roadmaps
Alignment matrix applications to current and target business capabilities
Mapping of current services and products with current and target application portfolios
Plotting of cost benefit analysis & ROI projection with roadmap milestonesIn this blog, we will avoid the complex form of a roadmap, and instead discuss a simplified but practical roadmap based on the work we have already done here.The picture shown here is a form of the roadmap which will help you achieve the To-Be state from the As-Is State based on the actions identified during the sustainable incremental steps planning.The milestones need to be set up according to the priorities of action. Elimination of applications will be taken with the highest priority to ensure high business value earliest.The investment in applications will be the last activity considering more knowledge will be gained during the initial milestone that will be leveraged to ensure minimum investment and maximum value.Another critical factor is that you need to keep the roadmap live and kicking, i.e., very much up to date with progressive changes reflected in milestone scope and dates, etc.To conclude - In this frame, you can draw a roadmap, from simple to complex as per your needs.7. Transformation challenges and workarounds (challenges of foundational setup/scaling investment vs. ROI etc., incremental approach)Let us talk about practical challenges (Cn) and workarounds (Wn) related to the transformation journey.C1 - Prioritization for the various factors, business needs, critical resource schedule, short-term and long-terms benefits
W1 – The transformation team needs to create a prioritization matrix with clear prioritization criteria leading to unbiased and data-based prioritization





C2 - Scale and scope of transformation, if you fix something which is not broken, that can lead to transformation fatigue. Sometimes, not everything needs to be changed; there need only be minor tweaks and incremental improvements
W2 – The transformation team needs to consult all stakeholders, including the customer-facing team, before defining the scope and scale. It extremely essential to implement with an incremental approach, which allows organizational changes in scale and scope after a significant milestone





C3 - Lack of sense of urgency may lead to delayed transformation resulting in costing the organization great opportunity cost
W3 – It is vital to develop an environment with a healthy level of urgency, meaning team members will be more likely to anticipate and find issues in the earliest stages of transformation. In addition, organizational leaders can make it more personal for employees by sharing about the vision, and benefits of progressing forward.





C4 – High cost of transformation; while running the regular business, more investment is needed to complete activities related to transformation to avoid employee burnout.
W4 – Disrupt existing cost base by 20~40% by tapping into easy automation of means without harming current operations. We essentially say transformation should be paid by savings generated from transformed activities.





C5 – Lack of consensus for the transformation; lacking the alignment and awareness necessary to become a genuinely adaptive organization to embrace the transformation challenges
W5 – Build a coalition of transformation agents who represents a loyal, digitally competent employee and management representative without needing to train or recruit expensively. The benefit of the alliance will be individuals you are personally committed to understanding and embodying the ethos of transformation.





C6 – Technical debt associated with large tech stack; leading to dependencies on third-party suppliers resulting in a negative impact on the transformation journey
W6 – Rationalization of the IT architecture will avoid the trap of technical debt on larger suppliers that may have severe implications for competitive advantage.





C7 – Lack of leadership by key stakeholders; resulting in powerful natural resistance to transformation and multiple other roadblocks for leaders leading to a failed transformation journey
W7 – Leadership with a strong sense of purpose and a powerful vision are essential ingredients of transformation. The positive leadership by stakeholders here is managing change and leading it first and foremost by encouraging middle managers to execute the change consistently.In conclusion, will you be able to succeed in your transformation journey by drawing an aspirational 7-frame big picture with Integration, RPA, Intelligent Automation and other technology groups?The answer is yes. We can see that the 7-frame big picture can be used to plan and execute an extraordinary transformation for your business. At Tietoevry, we have a solid capability to advise in the digital transformation journey.

The importance of seeing the big picture in the data-driven digital transformation journey: Part 1,/en/blog/2022/11/the-importance-of-having-a-big-picture-in-the-data-driven-digital-transformation-journey/,Data / Abhijit Joshi / 22.11.2022,"In my last blog I discussed the reusable decision matrix for technology and tool choices. Now, let us explore what the big picture could be if you complete the first few transformation projects. In this blog, we will not restrict ourselves to solely IRIA-based solutions; the 7-frame big picture can be used to consider all data-driven solutions built in a broader group of technologies.Let us first understand why we need to have a big picture with a real-life example. Imagine you were a taxi driver in late 2004 (well before Google maps) in one of the big cities. You have been called by a passenger who does not speak your language but knows the road toward the destination based on previous visits.This means that the passenger keeps giving you instructions on when to take a right or left turn. As you can imagine, it is quite challenging for you as a driver receiving many and frequent instructions without having a clear destination. We value having destination pictures with milestone instructions.To put the example in a digital transformation context; we can easily say that the big picture is essential with a transformation project or program, providing a comprehensive plan to your destination, and acting as inspiration to realize business value.The big picture of digital transformation has 7 different frames:Market trends and peer journeys
End-customer and organization stakeholders’ expectations
As-Is state - application landscape assessment
To-Be state - visualization
Sustainable incremental steps planning
High-level transformational roadmap
Transformation challenges and workaroundsIn this first part, I will go through frames 1-4, and in my next blog, I will cover frames 5-7. All of which are needed to build a great big picture to succeed in your transformation journey.1. Market trends and peer journeysWe at Tietoevry see that many customers are realizing that if they use existing data and information effectively, they can cut operating costs. Once that thought settled in, they started exploring what could be done to achieve good results as quickly as possible. Every curious professional is eager to understand what our organizational peers, competitors, and market leaders are doing to gain competitive advantages.Here I am going to refrain from talking about market trend assessment frameworks considering that they can be overkill if you are in close contact with your customers.To get a view of market trends and peer journeys, you can use commonly available content and, if needed, invest in more special/custom content. The commonly available content I am referring to can be content like:Tech trend surveys from research firms like Zinnov, Everest, HFS Research, etc.
Market Guide from research firms like Gartner, IDC, Radar, etc.
Specialized industry reports from industry research firms like SSON, etc.In addition, the below-given sources add tremendous value to your understanding of peer journeys:Event sessions of special groups of professionals like Procurement and Operations, etc.
White papers or blogs published by your tech product partners like Microsoft, Oracle, etc.
Articles or blogs published by your SaaS partners like Tietoevry.
Tech blogs on professional network sites like LinkedIn and KDnuggets, etc.In addition to the above, if needed, you can invest in a special market research project driven by research firms focused on your industry, peers and competitors. Giving you an excellent picture of what is happening with your market peers.To conclude - In this frame, you document and track where the market is moving and the direction of your competitors2. End-customer and organizational stakeholders’ expectationsLet us move from the market to the customers and internal/external stakeholders. Let us divide this section into customer and internal/external stakeholder expectation management.Starting with the customers; it is imperative to understand what the customer is saying explicitly and implicitly. You may ask how to identify customer needs. There are many ways to figure out what is on the customer’s mind.Some of the common ways are:Existing customer data and information
Customer's customer product & services approach
Customer feedback and survey reports
Customer communication about future planning
Customers procurement and partner approach
Means-End analysis (Attributes, Benefits & Value)Typically, we have seen customers look for simple offerings of services, personalized attention, suppliers, focused on value delivery, transparent communication, and accessible, excellent talent from suppliers.In simple, practical terms, we can say that customers look for:suppliers who listen to the customer
suppliers who catch on to information and needs quickly without efforts on the customer side
suppliers who are pleasant and responsive to work withYou must document customer expectations and track them as a part of your steering group activities.In the second part of this section, let us focus on internal and external stakeholders, who are essential value-adding elements in any project. To clarify, internal stakeholders mean your sponsor and support teams (legal, HR, IT Ops, etc.), and external stakeholders can be suppliers and subcontractors, etc.In the large basket of internal/external stakeholder management activities, stakeholder mapping is an essential first step that can provide the insight your projects require to reach completion smoothly.Let us discuss key pointers for stakeholder management:1. Identify the key players at a glance, meaning knowing whom to engage, collaborate or inform at each stage of the project.2. Assess power, and understand the interests of each stakeholder to define strategies and communication plans accordingly.3. Making sure that all critical decisions are taken effectively and timely by holding consultations with relevant stakeholdersThe picture above shows a sample stakeholder categorization, leading to detailed stakeholder mapping and expectation assessments.After the assessment, it is vital to synchronize internal/external stakeholders’ expectations and project milestones. At every milestone, it is essential to validate the stakeholders’ thoughts.You need to list both the customers’ and stakeholders’ expectations and coordinate the project activities to ensure customers and stakeholders are committed (soft or hard) to the project’s success.To conclude - In this frame, you document and track the expectations of your customer as well as internal/external stakeholders.3. As-Is state – Application landscape assessmentThe As-Is state landscape describes an organization’s IT assets in the form of IT applications. As there are different types of assets, showing them in one structure is an important but complex activity.To get a clear picture, it is essential to complete an inventory of IT assets and characteristics. Various inventory forms can represent the As-Is application state like matrix, layer structure, etc. The above-shown picture represents one listing form of all the applications with crucial attributes.The IT business’ hard reality is that the application landscape needs to be progressively refined to enable consistent benefits. In addition to inventory, it’s important to implement processes and tools to ensure the inventory can be maintained effectively and efficiently.Here you can see a sample application portfolio assessment report. The picture show categorization of all the applications with size and business outlook (Invest, Migrate, Eliminate or Tolerate)Typically, you have to analyse, assess and rationalize the technology portfolio, then recommend existing applications to re-host, re-platform, rewrite/replace, consolidate, and decommission.To conclude - In this frame, you document and track the As-Is State of your application eco-system4. To-Be state – VisualizationAs any traveller on any journey, you and I always need the target we want to reach – in transformation terms, it is essential that you draw a ‘To-Be State” visualization.A “To-Be State” visualization can help you prioritize effectively, set better goals, and improve scope, time, and quality. You can make decisions that drive long-term results by developing a complete perspective of a situation.The critical and consistent factors of the To-Be state visualization is:A relevant starting point representing all essential elements of your eco-system
A pragmatic mindset is key, as visualization will be continuously evolving with every passing dayBelow is a sample “To-Be state” visualization drawn by the core transformation team of a customer. Each moving piece in the picture below tells us a vital activity group that plays a crucial role in the transformation journey.You can use this or any other To-Be state image as a starting point for drawing your transformation To-Be state vision image. Please reuse the excellent work your peers and market leaders have created as a starting point for your journey. Avoid reinventing the wheel!Once you have an excellent starting point, you must regularly establish a standard practice to review, customize and enhance the To-Be State Image.As time progress, your understanding of your business needs increases, resulting in the refinement of the To-Be state picture. The vital factor to consider here is that all enhancements must be made regularly with clear criteria and reasoning.To conclude - In this frame, you document and track the To-Be state visualization of your application eco-systemWe are well on our way to visualizing the big picture of digital transformationI have now presented the first 4 frames needed to visualize the big picture. These 4 steps and suggested methods will help you to achieve a more clear direction for your transformation journey. In my next blog I will go through the last 3 frames, (5) Sustainable incremental steps planning, (6) High-level transformational roadmap, and (7) Transformation challenges and workarounds. All of which are needed to complete the big picture.If you want to discuss how we can support your business, me and my colleagues would be happy to help.

What sets SaaS apart from on-prem and processing centre solutions in the payments space?,/en/blog/2021/11/2-what-sets-saas-apart-from-on-prem-and-processing-centre-solutions-in-the-payments-space/,Cloud / Igors  Iljaseko / 16.11.2022,"SaaS customer receives a turn-key solution with all the services and software components included in the delivery package. Scope varies depending on customer requirements and SaaS provider flexibility.SaaS brings added controlGiven sufficient resources and flexibility, a SaaS provider can create an offering that provides significant control over the following components:Software deployment – SaaS provider must possess proficiency required to design and implement a high availability solution, but it is possible to adjust to accommodate customer IT policies. At minimum, customer must be able to validate and approve the deployment from both technical and compliancy perspective.
Custom functionality – this is the very reason a bank might not be able to accept a standardized processing centre proposal. It is possible to adjust SaaS solution functionality according to customer needs.
Development process – if SaaS delivery is served by the same company that develops the software, customer is in a better position compared to both on-prem and processing centre arrangements in terms of service flexibility. In a custom-tailored SaaS setup, the customer is assigned a designated technical team with direct access to the development division. This results in faster change request delivery time and organic solution changes without investing time in learning technical details of the software.
Maintenance and delivery process – every change in the SaaS solution is coordinated with customer. Every incident is reported to customer in detail alongside with a plan to improve the solution and to avoid any future service disruptions.Such an approach is critical for larger banks that cannot accept a cost reduction focused, multitenant processing centre setup, but still want to outsource a part of its solution.Custom tailored SaaS setup mimics own IT department from the business owner point of view.Single tenant vs. multitenancy setupTraditionally, processing centres run 3rd party software that creates significant cost base for the processor. Constant push for cost optimization forces the processor to use multitenancy setup as part of standardized product offering that often is not best suited for larger banks.Up until now, there were limited options for financial institutions willing to outsource their solutions. This is where a SaaS model can provide a solution, if it is served by the same company that develops the software product. Such arrangement decreases SaaS provider costs, allowing it to serve single tenant setup, adjusted to customer needs.Single tenancy is about control over the entire solution, data residency, dedicated teams, and processes. It guarantees zero impact from other customers that would be served by the same software solution in multi-tenant setup. Noisy neighbours can impact not only solution performance but also potential functional issues and limitations.Key aspects to consider when choosing a SaaS provider:1. Ensure the provider prioritizes their employeesStrong and cohesive teams with years of accumulated knowledge and experience are critical for high quality of service and business continuity. Therefore, SaaS provider must be acutely aware of their employees as TOP priority.At TietoEVRY, our biggest strength and value are our employees. TietoEVRY puts in every effort to maintain a thriving work environment with emphasis on transparency, employee training, individual development plans, evaluation, feedback system, and clear career growth path. We have talented and skilled employees that are passionate about their job – and we strongly believe this is key to a long-term service quality.2. Specialization in software development and hostingAlongside a software development profile, seek for a partner that is highly experienced in hosting and maintaining complex multi-cloud IT solutions with long-term experience in payments and cards business. This does indeed set TietoEVRY apart from companies that primarily have a payments software development profile and who are trying to grow their hosting abilities as a side business.3. Multi-discipline teams provide extensive expertiseA strong partner should have the capabilities to utilize large teams of competence outside of the stand-alone solution. For example, a breadth of business analysts, DevOps, Public Cloud and classic infrastructure technicians, compliancy specialists, maintenance and support employees, and dedicated SaaS teams should be able to provide a reliable, stable, and flexible SaaS service that is deployed in any cloud environment. Only a large company with long-term specialization both in software development and in service provision can provide such level of expertise.Focus on system availabilityTotal system availability is a result of individual component combination. Every single component of Card Suite SaaS deployment is built with a high availability and redundancy incorporated. The SaaS solution can be deployed both within our Private Cloud or in Public Cloud for quick deployment time, automation, and global reach. Or both the Private and Public Cloud can be combined for improved flexibility.Competitive and transparent pricing modelCombining many years of experience and economy of scale should enable your partner to be able to provide transparent pricing for its SaaS services. The pricing model should be adjusted to key card business metrics. Such an approach allows our customers to isolate themselves from the technology whilst keeping the focus on business and new revenue stream development. There is no need to spend time on investigating hardware and software license pricing. Our customers have a clear fee model based on card business metrics under strict SLA. Unless specifically required by customer, technical details are taken care of by TietoEVRY.Having reviewed the key factors in choosing a SaaS over other business models and revising what are the key contributing factors to a strong SaaS partner, read the next blog that explores the flexibility SaaS solutions may offer, specifically in card issuing and e-commerce areas.

Maximize your cloud investments by improving your developer's experience,/en/blog/2022/11/blog-developer-experience-leeds-to-productivity/,Cloud / Andreas Blomberg / 15.11.2022,"The topics on every CIO´s agenda are efficiency, cutting costs and reducing environmental impact. But also, which is just as important, to keep up with the demands of all consumers of digital services. This increases the need for continuous innovation to stay competitive and relevant in the market, in all sectors.DevOps 2.0Digitization is progressing faster than ever and there are several reasons for that; streamline processes, enable data driven decision making, enhance customer experience and, of course, make use of new technologies in general to drive business.The impact this has on traditional IT is substantial. The pursuit of reduced lead times and faster time-to-value through agile methodologies and ways of working, sets higher demands on efficient and highly automatable platforms. This also affects and challenges traditional operational processes e.g., ITIL.A pain point for many executives is to find enough resources with the right technical skillset residing in the borderland between development and IT Ops, especially when adding the complexity of cloud and security in hybrid IT environments.There's a lot of trees here, but where's the forest?Although the cloud enables efficiency and automation in many ways, organizations swiftly discover that lots of different capabilities are required to get full value out of cloud investments. To name a few such capabilities; architecture, automation development, monitoring, governance, networking, identity and access management, security, test automation, integrations, deployment and configuration as code. And in a hybrid scenario this is valid for both traditional infrastructure as well as for Cloud.Where to start?So, how do we improve developer experience? Many of our customers provide critical services to society and serve national interests in the Nordics. Successful organizations are far along in the process of executing a cloud transformation journey, to become more agile and efficient but also more resilient. The common denominator, based on our experience, is that companies that are successful in reaching a high degree of developer productivity also are at a higher maturity level when it comes to utilizing continuous development through autonomous teams, automated platforms and truly embracing a culture of DevOps.Björn Svensson, Cloud Advisor, Tietoevry ConnectAndreas Blomberg, Cloud Advisor, Tietoevry Connect", Andreas Blomberg ,Cloud , 15.11.2022
"Even in energy management, little streams make big rivers",/en/blog/2022/11/even-in-energy-management-little-streams-make-big-rivers/,Digitalization / Sirpa  Repo  / 14.11.2022,"With skyrocketing energy prices daily in the news, people and businesses are understandably worried about coping this winter, the more so the further north they are. The situation is not made any better by the gloomy predictions of energy shortages, or that in some countries, plans are being made for rolling blackouts.We can’t go on using energy like nothing happened, because it doesn’t make economic sense. We can’t stop using energy altogether to save, because that will shut down vital functions both at home and in industry.What is needed in-between is an intelligent energy management solution. Ideally, it pinches a little from here and there when possible, and intelligently makes energy available where it is needed at any given time.Large-scale management benefits everyoneSome coinciding trends point to the sensibility of implementing such a distributed setup. First, the need to manage energy cost. Second, the “green shift”, the increasing proportion of energy being generated by weather-dependent means. Third, the growing electrification of societies that requires a reliable supply of energy to work as intended.One important aspect of distributed energy management is that prosumers, power consumers who also operate their own power generation, can actively participate in the electricity market. Because of the two-way connection to the grid, micro-producers can sell any surplus energy they generate to the retailer. Again, everyone wins.A solution for any organization with many connected assetsDistributed energy management is an ideal solution not only for energy companies, but also for building owners, automation or heating system providers, electric vehicle charging providers, teleoperators, and public bodies like city or district administrations.Bringing together up to hundreds of thousands of devices under one management allows demand response at scale. For example, the batteries of hundreds of electric vehicles connected to their charging stations could be used as a virtual power plant by depleting each of their batteries hardly noticeably if at the same time electricity is needed elsewhere. Similarly, charging can be timed to hours when electricity is at its cheapest. Everyone wins.Consumers connected to any of these networks benefit from being able to monitor their own consumption, selling their surplus power, and being reimbursed for their participation in a virtual power plant setup.A peek under the bonnetEnergy transition and the increasing use of renewable energy sources – wind being the most important as of now – changes the energy industry from centralized to distributed. This means that volatile power generation requires distributed energy management.The entire energy system requires more flexibility. In practical terms, the increasingly weather-dependent and decentralized energy system needs to be digitally managed from production to consumption. Digitalization enables both system stability and new connected services.In a wider picture, the energy system benefits from flexible balancing and load shifting, thereby avoiding peak power supply through fossil-fired power plants and distributing energy resources for maximum usability.Peace of mindTietoevry’s Distributed Energy Solution (DES) provides a platform to manage, control and aggregate energy assets regardless of manufacturer. DES is a cloud-native, modular solution for automated digital management of the whole value chain from energy generation to consumption.Because DES is a disparate system that sits atop all the other underlying systems, it avoids the dreaded vendor lock-in. It works together with just about anything.For an individual customer, being able to manage their personal carbon footprint, savings in energy cost and revenue for energy market participation are the most important takeaways.To hear more about the Distributed Energy Solution, you’re most welcome to visit Tietoevry’s stand at Slush 2022 in Helsinki on 17–18 November.

Towards a cleaner and more intelligent energy system,/en/blog/2022/11/veturi-towards-a-cleaner-and-more-intelligent-energy-system/,Digitalization /  Fredrik  Jansson / 7.11.2022,"In the energy transition, we are moving towards renewable production on a large scale, and as a result, an even more decentralized production infrastructure is being formed. At the same time, the number of assets using energy increases and they become smarter. A more weather dependent production needs to be balanced not only with energy storage but also with flexible energy use. All this requires integration and data-driven control.Tietoevry has an extensive know-how as well as a product and service range in the application and solution development of the energy industry. Our products are used in network planning and maintenance, in the installation and maintenance work related to the meter infrastructure and the collection of metering data, balance management, customer information and billing. Our latest service is a cloud-native platform for managing distributed energy resources, creating virtual power plants to participate in flexibility markets, peak-shaving or other use cases. We are in a strong position to start developing a more data-driven service offering for the energy sector together with research and business partners.Cooperating in new solutions to support the green transitionIn order to achieve decarbonization and better predictability and control for the needs of both electricity distribution, energy system stability and trading, even more extensive data collection and cooperation around data is needed. These are the areas we will concentrate on in the energy research projects of the Veturi programme.Our partner network currently comprises energy and network companies, companies managing large energy-intensive processes and smaller specialized companies, as well as research institutes conducting new research.Tietoevry’s role in the Veturi programme is to be an integrator which brings the partners together to build new solutions on top of data.Our ecosystem projects are focusing on e.g. the following research topics, the combined effect of which will support decarbonization:New digital service entities for wind power operators’ needs
Better network management and data-driven planning of the power grid for distribution system operators
Solutions with which energy companies can react to the market changes as well as increased small-scale production and distributed intelligent energy resources
Better regional management of energy data, helping local companies in green transition
E-mobility, better energy management of facilities, more real-time data collection and analysis
Utilizing artificial intelligence and cloud-based data platformsThe next deadline for ecosystem projects in Business Finland’s schedule is in January and March.

Workday Peakon Employee Voice: Why businesses thrive when employees are heard,/en/blog/2022/11/Workday-Peakon-Employee-Voice-Why-Businesses-Thrive-When-Employees-Are-Heard/,Digitalization / David Somers / 2.11.2022,"It's no secret that employees are the organisation's most valuable asset. So it follows that during a period when change truly has been the only constant, providing employees with a positive employee experience—and being able to flex to support shifting needs—has been critical. Technology plays an important role in supporting this, helping organisations understand their employees' concerns and feedback, more deeply analyse their sentiment, and take meaningful action in response.Workday Peakon Employee Voice is an intelligent listening platform that converts feedback into actionable insights. In this blog post, David Somers, Workday’s group general manager of product for the office of the CHRO, and Phil Chambers, Peakon co-founder and now Workday’s general manager for Peakon, tell us all about Workday Peakon Employee Voice and why employee listening is so critical for organisations.""Put simply, it lets organisations continuously collect employee feedback and provides a way to turn that feedback into dialogue and action.""To set the scene for our readers, let’s start with an overview of the product.Chambers: Workday Peakon Employee Voice is a platform that enables intelligent listening at scale by using machine learning to collect and analyse confidential feedback from employees in real time. Put simply, it lets organisations continuously collect employee feedback and provides a way to turn that feedback into dialogue and action.The employee voice was always important, and it’s well known that engaged employees are not only happier but also more productive. The societal changes we’ve seen over the last few years accelerated the need to make employees a first-class stakeholder in their own engagement, which is exactly what Workday Peakon Employee Voice does. It turns insights about topics such as engagement, diversity and inclusion, and health and wellness into action through conversations, personal dashboards, team collaboration, and contextual learning resources.Somers: In this time of massive digital transformation, intelligent listening enables you to get a continuous view of what's going on with your employees, and that's a superpower for an organisation. It helps you get ahead of challenges by identifying them early so you can reduce the risk they may create. It can also help you reduce attrition risks and attract new talent. You can truly listen to your employees, hear what they're saying, benchmark that information, and respond in real time. It's more important than ever.Why is adding the ability to listen to employees a benefit to our customers?Somers: According to survey analysis, ""Organisations that invest in employee experience outperform peers by 147% in earnings per share.""If you’re the CEO of any company right now, your biggest opportunity to execute on your strategy is people: retaining and training the people you have, helping them understand where your organisation is going, recruiting new people to your company, and also encouraging and promoting belonging and diversity.Companies build many applications that allow you to push things down, but very few allow you to get information flowing back, providing a real-time feedback loop. I don't know how you run an organisation without having a product like this today—without this constant feedback.And if you’re a manager, your team executes based on what you’re doing and your guidance. Now we can give managers a toolset that allows them to listen to their team, take that feedback, and get better at their job. Who wouldn’t want to put something like that in place? Who wouldn’t want that capability?Chambers: Our platform allows customers to accurately and contextually merge both demographic information and what we call “perceptual data,” such as the level of employee engagement, sentiment, and productivity. It provides a complete picture of your employees that nothing else can.We provide a seamless experience for users and admins, alongside the rest of Workday Human Capital Management (HCM), with single sign-on, one security model, and one place to manage employees. Customers can also drive action in Workday based on these employee voice insights and then measure the impact of those actions. It’s a more powerful analysis this way.Any final thoughts?Chambers: Workday Peakon Employee Voice helps create a dialogue between employees and people leaders that’s dramatically different from what’s come before, and it’s really powerful in terms of surfacing what’s on people’s minds and turning that into actions. Ultimately this is a continuous feedback loop that can help your company as a whole become much more agile.Somers: Workday Peakon Employee Voice allows you to have that context around comments and ratings, and I think the context is critical. And then you use technology like natural language processing, which allows you to take thousands of employee comments, roll them up, and slice and dice them quickly, so you can look at things you should be looking at. It becomes scalable.Change has become the norm, and with that organisations must build resilience and adapt to constantly changing needs, especially as we think about future work models that work for everyone. To be and stay successful, organisations must be able to shift without friction. This is enabled by a workforce that feels engaged, safe, empowered—and heard.", David Somers ,Digitalization , 2.11.2022
The ’new normal’ in cybersecurity – or is there one yet?,/en/blog/2022/10/the-new-normal-in-cybersecurity--or-is-there-one-yet/,Cybersecurity insights / Maria Nordgren / 31.10.2022,"Indeed, I would claim it is too early to begin talking about a ‘new normal’ in cybersecurity. The cybersecurity 'new normal' is a fluid concept requiring a new approach.The society utilizes and is increasingly dependent on digitalization when developing critical services. Digitalization requires that security is built into these services, it cannot be sprinkled on top once they are ready. What is also required is security awareness – and knowhow - from companies, citizens and the public sector.Digitalization provides enormous opportunities and also benefits. Cybersecurity provides a foundation for reaping the rewards. But cyberattacks will occur, so monitoring of anomalies becomes a must.

Unprecedented speed of infrastructure creation and updatesOn-prem hardware purchase, shipping, and setting up a single server can take a month or more. For smooth project execution, one may need to invest in careful planning of future software and hardware needs. An alternative is to be reactive and order on-the-go, which results in delayed project implementation time, especially in the situation of unpredictable shipping and chip availability time.Hardware delivery lead time is a considerable factor that is nullified by Public Cloud, where server instantiation and setup only takes minutes. One can truly incorporate a “deploy-as-you-go” approach, relieving application management team from the burden of IT sourcing process.2. Automation to minimize repetitive tasks and human errorThe entire hardware stack within Public Cloud is configurable via software, due to provision in the form of virtualized objects. Such level of virtualization is practically unattainable by standard on-prem hosting techniques. Public Cloud allows a new “replace-not-repair” approach within the infrastructure and middleware layers. As a result, system administrators can spend their time creating and finetuning etalon objects for individual deployment components replacement, avoiding repetitive tasks that can be prone to errors.3. Single infrastructure provider for effortless procurementIf you have experienced first-hand the IT sourcing process required to build your own data centre, you can certainly appreciate the time and effort it takes to manage software licenses and hardware procurement. These tasks are considerably reduced in Public Cloud. This frees up valuable time for designing your solution rather than negotiating with individual vendors.Many have spoken in depth about the benefits of public cloud, but in our experience in Payments, there are specifics regarding both hosting and back-end software capabilities that should be key considered when endeavouring this route. To learn what challenges Public Cloud poses when moving your payment software solutions, please read in a blog “Power through the challenges of moving your payments to cloud’’ .Related blogs

City’s smartness is measured in inhabitant satisfaction,/en/blog/2022/10/plenty-of-data-is-available-but-do-we-know-how-to-harness-it-to-promote-wellbeing/,Cloud / Mikko Pulkkinen / 31.10.2022,"In urban development, technology is a good servant but a bad master. It offers endless opportunities to build smart services but, in the end, solutions are smart only if they improve people’s wellbeing and enhance the quality of life.The question is how well are inhabitants heard in urban development and how much do they use the smart solutions offered. Technology offers tools for this, too, but the use of existing data needs to be developed. Even now, roughly 80 per cent of the industrial data in the EU’s economic area is left completely unused and, at the same time, the exponential growth of data doubles the amount of available data every two years.Public discussion is saturated with talk about the potential offered by digitalization, artificial intelligence and cloud services, but less attention is paid to how the opportunities offered by the constantly increasing amount of data can be optimally harnessed to promote people’s physical, mental, economic and social wellbeing. Without this common goal, there is a risk that data will remain scattered and fragmented into pieces that benefit no one. People’s phones are already full of applications, the features of which are not fully recognised or used. With this discussion opener, I'm shifting the focus from data orientation to inhabitant-centric urban development.In search of a good lifeSmart technologies enable cities to improve the quality of people’s lives by, for instance, streamlining mobility, facilitating work, reducing energy consumption and costs as well as increasing the freedom of choice, the availability of services and the safety of the living environment. To achieve this, however, service developers must be able to use the data produced by cities appropriately.The freer the flow of data, the better different parties can make use of it in their decision-making and thus have an active influence on the creation of a smart urban environment. When both the public sector and companies can make decisions more broadly based on existing data, there will be more relevant insights, resource-smart implementations and high-quality urban solutions that benefit people’s lives.The COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated the development of applications that make people’s everyday lives easier, and permanent changes in work culture have ensured an established market position for many services also under normal circumstances.Under the exceptional circumstances, actions taken by companies included adopting a more active role in using the vacant capacity of their premises in more diverse ways and opening their premises also to their partners, for instance, thus providing people with opportunities to work in multiple locations. A happy urban life is built in a well-functioning ecosystem, not solely by the city administration. With this in mind, favourable conditions should be created for using data.Easy mobility is an integral part of urban lifeSmart cities are not a vision far off in the future but are strongly present already today, although there is still a lot of work to do. Good examples of tapping into the potential of data to make urban life easier are numerous, both near and far. Rated as one of the world’s smartest cities in international comparisons, Helsinki has attracted global attention with its extensive service digitalization and smart traffic solutions. In Barcelona, urban traffic development has been taken even further.The Mobility as a Service (MaaS) application adopted by the City of Helsinki makes it possible to purchase seamless travel chains from your home to your destination, which reduces the need for private car use. Life becomes easier and commuting even in the busy traffic of the city centre is smooth when you can take an e-scooter from your home to the metro and then from the metro directly to the door of your workplace.In Barcelona, available data was used for analysing people’s mobility behaviour and routes. As a result, the routes of the solar-powered hybrid buses could be optimised so that up to 95 per cent of city traffic trips now involve a maximum of one change of vehicle.The potential of smart technologies to improve urban mobility and energy efficiency also expands far beyond the development of public transport.There are endless opportunities to make urban life easier. For instance, the efficiency of city maintenance could be improved by using machine vision in public transport. Sensors installed on buses would automatically observe and report maintenance needs, such as poor road surfaces or unclear traffic signs.As an example of the diverse opportunities offered by solutions that enhance the comfort of the living environment, in Barcelona smart sensors are used in the street lighting system, which constantly measures air humidity, air pollution, temperature, the number of people and noise level and adjusts lighting accordingly to make it as people-friendly and energy-efficient as possible.The transformation towards a smart city is built in a culture of experimentation, which encourages co-operation and bold innovation. Even actions that seem small on a broader scale may eventually lead to decisive insights and significant savings.Image: Mikko Pulkkinen - We innovate smart technologies in Keilaniemi, Espoo cherishing human values.Independent decision-making is everyone’s rightFrom the perspective of the entire society, smart solutions may lead the way towards a higher degree of self-sufficiency, which is, as a consequence of the geopolitical situation and the energy crisis, a factor influencing safety, economy and quality of life.Alongside sustainable development, the question of self-sufficiency with regard to natural resources has become increasingly important. Indeed, on a global scale, there are examples of buildings that adjust the indoor temperature automatically and of electricity networks that are entirely powered by solar panels.On the other hand, the discussion about self-sufficiency and the right of self-determination is also linked with the processing of data. Data is power and power entails responsibility. In addition to innovating new smart technologies, it must be possible to ensure inhabitants’ privacy protection and ITC connections also under exceptional circumstances.When it comes to data, Helsinki, for instance, adheres to the MyData principle, according to which inhabitants own their data. This is also the European principle. A data economy that adheres to European values respects people’s privacy and right of self-determination, but the EU’s regulation does not extend beyond its borders, where most data is nowadays processed. With server farms located on sovereign territory, it can be ensured that no outsiders can access sensitive data.Safe and secure smartnessAs a leading European IT company, Tietoevry is taking cities towards the adoption of smart technologies that enhance the quality of life while fostering people-oriented values. The experience of the leading Nordic company in its field and its advanced strategies for the inhabitant-centric development of smart cities have also been praised in an international industry evaluation.IDC European MarketScape’s Smart Cities 2020 report highlighted Tietoevry as one of the most significant operators in the industry in innovating digital platforms and developing sustainable infrastructure, traffic and general safety and security. The purpose of the report is to provide cities and companies with objective information about industry expert services to support the technological transition.Cloud services are a solution for tapping into the potential offered by data and a sovereign cloud is the answer to security-related questions. The multicloud makes it possible to process data flexibly depending on its nature. Security is ensured by processing sensitive data carefully within Finnish borders.Author, Mari Korhonen", Mikko Pulkkinen ,Cloud , 31.10.2022
Digital resiliency,/en/blog/2022/10/digital-resiliency/,Cloud / Björn  Svensson / 28.10.2022,"ChallengeIn our part of the world, we are facing a security situation and instability that is worse now than in over 40 years. Ongoing war, attacks on critical infrastructure, electricity shortage and high inflation, to name a few. Events that weren’t on anybody’s radar just a year ago, and the future implications of these events are hard to predict.On top of these risks and threats, organizations are increasingly facing cyber-attacks, as the rapid speed of digitalisation has made us totally dependent on IT and criminals exploit that fact to the fullest. Threats have become so common that many organizations are now shifting focus from preparing for a single event to always ensuring business continuity, through quick recovery from almost any event – both from known risks, but also unknown threats waiting around the corner.ImplicationIf there is one thing keeping executives up at night, it’s the question of; what’s the implication to our business if the worst thing happens, and how quickly can we recover from that event.A digitised business with ever-growing data volumes, with multi-cloud environment where business-critical systems span across platforms, it’s not hard to imagine the increasing complexity of always knowing where the data resides and keeping it safe.If, or when your organisation is subject to a cyberattack, knowing in advance which systems, processes and what data are considered critical to the business, and what is the acceptable limits of consequences for these is crucial to understand. That way, you can prioritise your efforts and investments to modernise the security postures around those systems and processes.It all comes down to two things; having data to recover from and being able to recover quickly.ResolutionMany of our customers provide critical services to society and serve national interests in the Nordics. Successful organizations are typically well on their way executing a cloud transformation journey to become more agile and efficient but also, more resilient.The common denominator, based on our experience, is that these companies have both ensured they always have data that they can recover from, but also that they have significantly reduced the recovery time from days (if not weeks) to minutes and hours. This is made possible through early detection and fully automated recovery, even to different regions of the world if needed.Björn Svensson, Cloud Advisor, Tietoevry Tech ServicesAndreas Blomberg, Cloud Advisor, Tietoevry Tech Services", Björn  Svensson ,Cloud , 28.10.2022
Brownfield approach – Your quick and cost-efficient conversion to SAP S/4HANA,/en/blog/2022/09/brownfield-approach-your-quick-and-cost-efficient-conversion-to-sap-s4hana/,NextGen Enterprise / Mikko Vepsäläinen / 27.10.2022,"Why the Brownfield conversion?As a procedure, this conversion is the cheapest way to migrate to the SAP S/4HANA software version. In the conversion, all existing functionalities migrate to the new version without the need to involve your business in anything except the end user testing phase. The conversion, therefore, allows more time to implement the new SAP S/4HANA functionalities later on. Some reasons why Brownfield is a conversion procedure:Crucial software components you have already invested in will become some of the new S/4 functionalities.
The new features can be implemented little by little late on, in a controlled way.
The HANA database brings significant performance improvements, which the end user can see at once: for example, faster report loading.
In terms of SAP life cycle costs (that is, version upgrades and maintenance support), you can upgrade to new features several times a year or at least once every two years, depending on your licensing model.
The S/4HANA versioning cycle enables out-of-the-box features, which are crucial to new businesses, as well as new company-specific coding.

Instead of ABAP coding, S/4HANA offers the possibility of integrated customisations outside the core ERP: for example, on the SAP TBP coding platform or the Azure, AWS or Google platforms. As a result, we can retain the compatibility of your S/4HANA versions and provide easier upgradability in the future.Who is the procedure suitable for?The conversion option is especially suitable for organisations that have up-to-date SAP versions with low client-specific ABAB coding. Typically, the conversion procedure is recommended for small organisations whose systems have low amounts of data to migrate in the conversion.Who is this conversion not recommended for?The conversion procedure is not suitable for SAP user organisations that genuinely want to modernise their business processes, user interfaces or the transparency of their SAP systems to customer or supplier interfaces. This conversion is not the recommended procedure fororganisations with many customised, ABAB-coded features in existing SAP applications. The conversion procedure involves having to check all the functionality against S/4HANA functionality.
Organisations with multiple SAP instances because of corporate acquisitions, not because of mutual business needs or other reasons.
for large organisations with short downtimes (for example, from Saturday to Sunday) providing the only opportunities to upgrade SAP to a fresh version.What will change with the conversion?As the outcome of the conversion procedure, the organisation will have access to the same functionalities together with the same operations manuals and user interfaces as before, taking into account the following constraints:The HTML5 functionalities of the SAP FIORI user interface must be checked and possibly recoded.
The SAP BW data pool interfaces must be checked so that the data is passed on for reporting.
The ABAP-coded features must be checked against the new simplified table structure and code, using the Simplification Item list as the procedure.
In terms of licensing, some of the functionalities will no longer be authorised under the previous licences. For example, some of the SAP WM-Warehouse Management functions are no longer available in the S/4HANA standard version without the customer having to purchase a new version of Extended Warehouse Management (EWM).How is the Brownfield conversion implemented?The Brownfield conversion procedure is suitable for SAP On-Premise or Private Cloud licensing models. Conversions are not possible when migrating to Public Cloud licensing. The conversion enables migration to a RISE with SAP contract. We have built our own packaged conversion procedure with SAP (SAP Certified Package) to support your S/4HANA conversion journey.Figure: The Tietoevry packaged conversion procedureThe Tietoevry packaged procedure and tools first identify the baseline and readiness for conversion as follows:The objective of the ‘Prepare’ step is to identify what is going to be done in the project and make the terms, tools and working methods familiar.The key tools and steps used in ‘Prepare’ consist of the following:SAP Readiness Check: this produces a report that shows sizing data relating to the configuration as well as the changes required by the applications.
SCMON/SUSG: custom code scoping can be started at this stage; the purpose of this is to:

find the custom codes used by the system. The compatibility of these needs to be checked.
Reveal any unused custom codes. The unused custom codes need to be removed from the system before conversion to avoid unnecessary work.


ATC Check tool: A custom code check is performed as well. This tool performs a code comparison to reveal what to do with the code. What other things can be done with this depends on the selected tool.
Simplification Item Checks are performed based on the SAP Readiness Check report.Figure: SAP Readiness Check reportFor example, S/4HANA 2020 has about 650 simplified code/information board items. Simplification has brought the new version and user interface speed, maintainability and new features.Other things covered by the SAP Readiness Check report:Software mostly used by end users
FIORI interface readiness for PC and mobile use
Business process improvement potential
S/4HANA compatibility with installed add-ons and how to handle them during the conversion
An estimate of the memory and disk capacity required by the HANA database,
IDOC and data storage migration functionality in S/4HANAThe purpose of the ‘Explore’ phase is to prepare the various things to be done in the system for the upcoming conversion.The key tools and steps of ‘Prepare’ consist of the following:Maintenance Planner: this tool provides a view of the maintenance baselines and selects the coming S/4HANA level for the various components.
Simplification Item Checks: running a check creates a list of things that must be changed/corrected before running the actual conversion.
Custom Code Preparation: this runs one more check to see if any changes to the custom code have occurred after the ‘Prepare’ phase. It also performs any final corrections to the code.Figure: An example of a software compatibility check against S/4HANAThe step ‘Realize’ covers the system conversion in a technical sense and the terms of application logic.This is an iterative process. At best, a fresh, non-customised SAP EHP6.0 Unicode with platform requirements (such as OS levels) at the necessary level will proceed in one run. In our experience, four to five conversions are needed depending on the SAP landscape.The conversion run consists of the following:Database migration to the SAP HANA database (if the source is not already in the HANA database)
Technical conversion to the S4/HANA program
Data conversion to the new S/4HANA data model during downtimeAfter this, the system performs the application conversion runs necessary for each application and makes the necessary functional adaptations, ABAP changes, database search optimisations and Fiori activations.The purpose of the ‘Deploy’ phase is to perform the learnt conversion package on the production system and ensure successful implementation. The steps taken in the production system are precisely the same as those learnt in the ‘Explore’ phase during the practice cycles. After ‘Go Live’, only the ‘Hypercare’ part is left.The key tasks in the ‘Deploy’ phase consist of the following:Cutover plan check
Production conversion
Business testing and approvals
Go/No-go decision-making
New system implementation
HypercareWith whom?The conversion method should be performed together with a certified partner. Tietoevry has an SAP-certified, packaged procedure for performing Brownfield conversions.How much work does the conversion require?Based on its experience, Tietoevry has created a T-shirt model showing the estimated conversion method workload for small, medium and large workload estimates as follows:When is the best time?Brownfield initiations are limited by the following constraints:If you want to continue in a server room or server maintained by either you or the supplier

Data as an Enabler part 1: Finding the purpose for data,/en/blog/2022/10/finding-the-purpose-for-data/,Data / Kirsi Linke / 27.10.2022,"To make change, data, IT, and businesspeople need to cooperate, define a purpose, and decide on tools and processes. This blog series guides you to do it.'It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.'- Sherlock Holmes in A Scandal in BohemiaLucky us, contrary to Sherlock, we do have data! Statista Research Department recently stated in a study that the total amount of data created, captured, copied, and consumed globally is forecast to increase rapidly, from 64.2 zettabytes in 2020 to more than 180 zettabytes in 2025 (source 1). That is 180 x 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 [1021] bytes of data at our disposal.This means that we live and operate in a complex ecosystem, where interconnected internal and external systems, operators, and operations create networks, in which the number of data sources is rapidly increasing. To navigate one’s way to the correct data source is challenging. Evaluating the accuracy of data might well be a mission impossible for an individual user.On many occasions we are still using our time hunting for information, finding and correcting errors, and looking for corroborating sources of information to replace those they do not trust. Forrester (source 2) reports that nearly one-third of analysts spend more than 40 percent of their time vetting and validating their analytics data before it can be used for strategic decision-making. It's unbearable in the long term if the search for data continues to be a time-consuming, laborious treasure hunt requiring specialized skills.Have you ever counted how many data sources you use daily in your work to make decisions?According to Matillion and IDG (source 3), the mean number of data sources per organization is 400. More than 20 percent of companies surveyed were drawing from 1,000 or more data sources.Also, the data itself is changing along with locations where data is stored. We do not store and consume only structured data in SQL databases and have point-to-point integrations between them, but we do it in almost 15 billion mobile devices (source 4), estimated 14.4 billion connected IoT devices (source 5), and on websites, social media, and other platforms.And we are rapidly moving from structured data to unstructured such as MS Office, pdf and other documents, emails, text and instant messages, images, videos, technical log, xml, and Json files and so on. IDC predicts that 80% of global data will be unstructured by 2025.Figure 1: An organization and individuals navigate in a complex data ecosystem. Sometimes, people are not aware of the data they have and how to use it in everyday decision-making. In some cases, data is even seen as a necessary evil, just needed for mandatory, regulatory reporting instead of an enabler for anything productive or new.No purpose, no benefitsAfter describing the situation with data, it is reasonable to ask what one’s organization has achieved with data.When we look at figures, we see that we underscore in Finland. The projected value growth of the data market is modest in relation to our digital capabilities, the business conditions based on digital technologies and key reference countries. Sweden and the Netherlands are expected to double the value of their data markets to EUR 7–8 billion by 2025, while our forecast as nation remains below EUR 1.5 billion (source 6).Why do we really lack behind? I see two reasons.Data investments are isolated one-off initiatives, not triggered by the business per se, and therefore fail to create tangible long-term benefit to the business.
The meaning of data – its purpose in the business context – is unclear, and organizations struggle to justify the investment. No investment, no return.I have seen that organizations often fail in communication, as finding the common vocabulary over data is not easy. People approaching data from technology point of view fail to sell the benefits in the language that the business stakeholders can relate to. Also, it’s fairly common that the organization has a business problem that could be solved with data, but they lack the required data expertise, or an interpreter who is able to build a bridge between business context, data content, technologies, and the people involved.Data should be treated as an asset like anything that has economic value to a business. It must have an understandable purpose for its existence, and in order for it to be productive it needs to be targeted with investment, maintenance, and development.Organizations believe poor data quality to be responsible for an average of $15 million per year in losses (source 5). Possible reasons for this vary; data is not managed like other assets in an organization, it does not have a dedicated owner, no one is responsible for its accuracy, availability, and maintenance. Even simple poor data entry practices, for example allowing duplicates to be created, cause poor data.Still, I have high hopes as many of our customers and other actors in our society are actively taking part in discussions around data, engaging themselves with data development initiatives. They are taking concrete steps to improve data literacy in their organization, enabling data to move closer to the end user. Businesses are taking more responsibility for ownership of data and data development.We made a finding in our Data x Business report (source 8) that one of the significant recent developments is that data is no longer seen as a pure technological initiative, but as an integral part of a business strategy. However, change cannot occur if the business value of the data is not understood in the organization.How is the current state in your organization?Figure 2: Data strategy is derived from the business strategy.Value from data - the whole is greater than the sum of its partsA big question is left; how do we ensure that we get value from data? We need to change the way we work with data. It means different things to different organizations.According to my experience, one of the most important things delves down to tight cooperation between data, IT, and businesspeople. We need to find a common understanding that data is an essential part of business, not a separate initiative.Imagine that all stakeholders sit in the same table and understand each other.To continue, the separation of the useful information from the vast amounts of data, verification of its accuracy, and its timely correct transfer in a secure way, is only possible if we know the people, cross-functional processes, and systems that produce the data in the first place and can also prevent it from flowing. We also need to understand how the systems are used and what are the interdependencies between the systems.We need data literate people with data expertise at various levels of the organization. We need a data management model and decision-making structures established along with the right tools. In addition, we need experts for the advanced technologies that enable data usage. We need to raise data awareness.And most importantly we need a purpose for the data, and the data itself needs to fit for the purpose!Figure 3: Creating value from data requires teamwork, where the players are humans and machines. Data needs doers and they need tools to refine data into useful information. Value creation requires cooperation between and across different business functions. To achieve purposeful data and to have the data as a real enabler for our businesses, we need solutions, ways of working, and guidelines for all elements shown in the figure.Data as an Enabler blog seriesIn this blog series, me and my colleagues will provide perspectives to understand data as an enabler for digital business. We hope to give something interesting to ponder, helping you to conquer challenges and find new opportunities in data. How to identify what purposeful data for your business is?

Hybrid work and the way forward,/en/blog/2022/10/hybrid-work-and-the-way-forward/,Digitalization / Thomas Rasch Brastad / 26.10.2022,"Something amazing has happed to the workplace during the last three turbulent years. I’ve seen low value work reduced to a minimum, and people coming together to work across silos and hierarchies. All just focusing on getting things done. Leaders had to simply trust their employees without top down management. People experienced unprecedented control, flexibility, trust, accountability, autonomy. And they don’t want to go back to the “old ways” of rigid work models.Companies in the Nordics have well adopted the hybrid work model, embracing the reality that their employees both enjoy and expect the flexibility to work remotely. It’s an important factor in closing the gap of talent shortage. And many unbiased surveys show that employee satisfaction increases with hybrid work. Still, both leaders and employees struggle to find a balance between individual self-productivity, and the need for social interaction at the office.The hybrid future of work, as defined by ISG, is characterized by three kinds of workplaces: (i) The digital workplace that includes the underlying technology; (ii) the physical workplace that defines the location or place of work as both in-office premises and remote; and (iii) the human workplace that describes the methods, processes, and cultural aspects.So how can we find the right mix between the digital, physical and human workplace? How can we tell if people are productive when working from home? And how can we support them in the future digital transformation?Well, first we need to trust our people! Don’t make rigid office policies for those few abusers. By now it is well proven that knowledge workers are in fact more productive and engaged given the flexibility of where and when to work.To quote Satya Nadella: “People come (to the office) for other people, people don’t come (because of a) policy. They come for the connection they want to have.”We can use technology to support these connections, and help foster a trust culture by empowering employees with the right toolset for effective digital collaboration. That way we enable our teams to independently find the right balance of hybrid work.Secondly, we need to support the individual needs. Some employees need user adoption training and coaching in the digital transformation. Others are “digital natives” and expect cutting edge tools and technology. (It’s worth noting that the Z-generation – born in the late 90s and early 2000s – is entering the workforce and will constitute ca 25% of the resources within two years.) And we’re all different in how and where we prefer to work. Which means we need to provide our people with the appropriate choice of devices, tools and applications.And finally, we need to be data-driven! Digital workplace services have moved from focusing on technology and simply end-user computing, to being a central part of the company’s digital transformation.The tech services are now integrated with transformation initiatives, with stronger emphasis on outcomes and value. That means we need to measure and analyze facts on the employee experience, needs, productivity, and retention. Combine this data with sentiment surveys, and you’ll have powerful tools to drive improvements and decisions in the digital transformation.According to ISG, Nordic enterprises need to establish clarity for hybrid requirements by evaluating the different employee demands, expectations, team needs and organizational needs. Corporate IT is expected to meet these requirements, and to play a central role in redefining the business and operating models for hybrid work. Many of the needs can be resolved by modern technology, and IT leaders are strategically investing in solutions that can improve the employee experience, no matter their work location.Just keep in mind, the future of hybrid work is not just about enabling our people to work from home. It’s about continuously shaping the company culture, digital solutions, and ways of working, in order to support the employee’s needs and secure their engagement and productivity.", Thomas Rasch Brastad ,Digitalization , 26.10.2022
How Artificial Intelligence can improve cybersecurity in industrial Machine Learning and IoT applications,/en/blog/2022/10/how-artificial-intelligence-can-improve-cybersecurity-in-industrial-machine-learning-and-iot-applications/,Data / Dr. David  Buffoni / 25.10.2022,"In this blog post, I elaborate on the findings we made as part of the InSecTT consortium* project.Cybersecurity challenges related to Machine Learning and IoTCyber-attacks are wasting companies’ time and money. 72% of industrial sector organizations have experienced cyber disruption to their IT environment at least six times during the past 12 months, with average financial damage estimated at $2.8 million [source1]. Another study suggests that data breaches caused by cloud security vulnerabilities cost companies an average of $4.8 million USD to recover [source2].Machine Learning based solutions that are currently integrated into cybersecurity solutions rely heavily on data. A new challenge appears when we store the Machine Learning algorithms’ training data on a centralized server, which can increase the vulnerability of the whole system.Joint effort to improve AioT cybersecurity with a unique automatic intrusion detection system approachTietoevry addressed these challenges in partnership with Mälardalen University by developing an automatic network intrusions detection solution that makes industrial systems less vulnerable to cyber threats.Network Intrusions detection is an old challenge in the Cybersecurity domain. Solutions are usually integrated into an industrial digital twin, which can detect and classify the type of cyber-attacks. Nowadays Machine Learning based solutions are the standard approach. They are constantly improved to monitor and detect potential threats more accurately.However, most solutions rely on a centralized Machine Learning setting, where all the network traffic is collected and uploaded to one server. The main drawbacks of the centralized approach are:Time criticality: By the time the centralized solution alerts about the attack, the attacker has already taken control of other machines.Data breach: An intruder can steal or copy all data if sniffing the network used for data send-outs.To tackle these challenges, we proposed a decentralized Machine Learning solution where the network intrusion system is deployed on each device. Consequently, this approach improves monitoring reactivity and removes data breaches by design.In the decentralized setup, an intruder is stopped when trying to connect to a new machine. And all data is kept locally in devices, not sending it over the network. This makes it more difficult for an intruder proceed with speed and gather all the data.Our solution is based on the Federated Learning paradigm where the intrusion detection algorithm is trained across multiple devices holding local network traffic data. Network traffic data remain on each device and are never exchanged with others.In the next chapters, I explain in more detail our Federated Learning solution for tackling network intrusions.The Federated learning approach helps to minimize potential data breachesAs the Machine Learning algorithms require a lot of data for training purposes, one of the main obstacles is the security of the provided data. Storing data and performing predictions on the centralized server can raise various security issues. These obstacles can be solved by the implementation of a federated learning approach.A federated learning approach is a decentralized learning technique that trains models locally and only transfers the parameters to the centralized server, which appropriately addresses the needs of removing potential data breaches in Intrusion Detection Systems.Our approach was to develop an anomaly-based intrusion detection system with a network-based data source (NIDS). We determined that the classification algorithm called Random Forest* had the best performances for both intrusion detection and attack classification, hence we proposed a federated learning approach of Random Forest. The Random Forest models were trained on each device with local data and transferred to the centralized servers where they were aggregated. We investigated different merging methods for aggregating local Random Forests that we evaluated only for intrusion detection, on well-known public datasets (KDD99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS-2017). The best performance was achieved with the model aggregating only the best Decision Trees from each Random Forest* (see Figure 1).Figure 1: Our approach utilized only the best Decision Trees from each Random Forest*The research proposes an automatic Intrusion Detection approach by limiting data breaches on centralized servers. The aim is to build a shared global learning model via decentralized learning using data generated from local devices or processes.Tietoevry and Mälardalen University published a scientific article on distributed machine learning: Random Forest Based on Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection [source3]Data reconstruction attacks as a future challengeAs a part of future work, we are investigating approaches to make our solution robust to potential data reconstruction attacks.Even if the Federated Learning setting makes it harder for attackers to cause data breaches, it may be possible for them to reconstruct the data based on the local models transferred to the centralized server. To avoid such scenario, it is possible to ensure data privacy constraint during the local training. Tietoevry carries out this kind of experiment to guarantee that the data are not compromised globally and locally.*Want to know more about InSecTT consortium?Tietoevry is a member of the Intelligent Secure Trustable Things (InSecTT) consortium, Europe’s largest joint effort on Artificial Intelligence of Things with a budget of over 40 million Euro distributed over 3 years.The project aims at creating trust in AI-based intelligent systems and solutions as a major part of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AioT) within applications in a variety of industries such as manufacturing, transport, logistics, and healthcare.In this project, Tietoevry is involved in the Secure Industrial Communications System use case where the aim is to elaborate a secure strategy for network systems that are more and more present in factories and the industrial sector.*What is Random Forest?Random Forest (RF) is usually composed of a set of Decision Trees.

Customer communications do not belong in ERP,/en/blog/2022/10/customer-communications-do-not-belong-in-erp/,NextGen Enterprise / Mika Laurell  / 19.10.2022,"It is quite common for organizations to send their customers a mishmash of communication via ERP, several back-end solutions such as CRM, and multiple other custom applications.In this article you'll learn:Challenges related to customer communicationsERP is not designed for customer communicationsHow to improve customer communicationsExperiences from SAP S/4HANA transformationThe challenge of keeping customer communications up to dateThe documentation that we send is integral to the customers’ service experience. We all know it is a struggle to keep all documents up to date regarding branding – and even more importantly, keeping them legal and accessible. Any changes need to be replicated to all involved systems. Even recognizing the different document processes is challenging. The same applies to integrations. Handling multiple endpoints and custom integrations will surely keep your IT busy and increases the risks of broken integrations.An automated customer notification from ERP contains the actual message correctly but it’s not up to date when it comes to readability, branding, legal issues, or accessibility.ERP is not designed for customer communicationsEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are in general meant for internal processes. An ERP is a perfect tool for what it is meant: accounting, procurement, supply chain operations, project and risk management. But it is not designed for managing external customer communication.Multiple back-end solutions are in direct contact with your customers, making it almost impossible to keep track of all communicationsIf you use back-end systems directly in your customer communications, this is why you need to reconsider:Quality and consistency of customer communications
It is impossible to control the consistency of communications throughout accumulated technology stacks that are channel-specific, business-specific, and department specific.
It is very difficult for business users to create and personalize customer communications with back-end solutions.





Reputation and security
There is an increased risk of colliding with legal or accessibility regulations.





Operational efficiencyScattered customer communication is expensive and difficult to maintain.How can customer communication be improved?Customers are getting increasingly demanding about content and channels. In today’s daily data bombardment, it is crucial that all company documents they receive from you are perfectly aligned with your company brand, and are compliant, accessible, and accurate.The modern way to handle customer communications happens at the front end of your systems. Customer Communications Management (CCM) solutions like Quadient’s Inspire give you full control and visibility of all communication deliveries. It enables the easy creation and maintenance of templates and constant screening of compliance and accessibility.The platform is easy to use for business users, which frees time for IT to concentrate on their core services.Ideally customer-facing communications are centralized to Customer Communication Management (CCM). All back-end solutions are integrated to CCM, and it will centrally manage the creation, delivery and archiving of the messages.With user centric UI (User Interface), content is easy to create, and it is also easy to gather data from multiple solutions into your documents. For example, you can add images from your DAM (Digital Asset Management), product specs and drawings from PIM (Product Information Management), and customer insights from CRM (Customer Relations Management) and fine-tune them to fit with CCM’s built-in AI (Artificial Intelligence).In today’s world, simple documents like Sales Orders can include personalized images of custom products, distinctive product specifications, and special instructions to deliver the order via multichannel sends. All this happens easily when using a modern CCM.Even this simple customer notification document from the previous example can use several data sources such as ERP, CRM, PIM, DAM and be aligned with the company brand. This is easily generated in the CCM solution, contributing to much better customer satisfaction and upsell/cross-sell opportunities.Modern communication tools, such as Quadient’s Inspire, can empower business users to manage customer communication with an easy-to-use user interface and template structure. This reduces IT’s workload, which is especially important when going through an ERP update that puts high demands on IT.Experiences from SAP S/4HANA transformationWe have seen first-hand just how much Quadient can help companies in SAP S/4HANA integrations. The Quadient Inspire CCM especially has great compatibility with SAP S/4HANA architecture. To ensure a frictionless process in all cases, we are also working on packaging the integration tools for SAP S/4HANA.Organizations starting their SAP update, or already using S/4 without the support of modern CCM, typically encounter these following challenges in their SAP-based customer communications:It is hard to create an automated document in SAP with more content than page length. Classic tools have severe difficulties in overflowing text reliably and formally to the next pages.
It is hard to add, for example, graphic content from external services like DAM. Describing complex products in documents like Sales Orders would require additional images, graphs, and drawings in the document, but with classic tools, it is a struggle to get them there.
It is hard to personalize documents with data from multiple sources such as CRM, ERP, and PIM with the support of built-in AI. Customers expect to receive meaningful information that is personalized for them – but you cannot achieve this with classic tools without extensive coding in the background.
It is hard to use non-western languages. Most classic tools have no support for typography such as Japanese, Arabic or Chinese. There could be limited support, or it does not exist at all – which can easily lead to poor customer experience and misunderstandings.These challenges may sound detailed and specific – but just think about the inefficiency and frustration that they cause in everyday communications. All these pain points are tackled in Quadient’s modern CCM tool.On top of this, it is good to know that when updating from SAP ECC6.0 to S/4HANA, all document templates will need manual rewriting in every case. There is no automation to make them accessible in an updated environment.This means that there is no difference in workload whether you re-build your templates for S/4HANA native tools or with Quadient CCM. The latter option just gives you so much more in the future.Your reflections?We are eager to hear your thoughts.

Starting a large-scale IT project with DevOps? Read this first.,/en/blog/2022/10/starting-a-large-scale-it-project-with-devops/,NextGen Enterprise / Tapani Tirkkonen / 18.10.2022,"But, as you probably well know, many have failed in implementing DevOps and backed off from it. Based on our experience with over a hundred successful large-scale IT projects, dozens of which ran with DevOps, we dare to say that many expensive DevOps failures can be prevented just by taking care of some issues right from the start.Before even considering implementing DevOps into large-scale IT projects, you need to understand what DevOps requires and what it can give at its best. Our recent blog post explains this in more detail. Shortly put: DevOps is neither a silver bullet for fixing traditional ways of working, nor a simple renaming of work titles or processes. It requires fundamental changes in how tens or hundreds of independent and autonomous teams work together towards the same goals.Four issues you cannot bypassRunning a large-scale project is complex, no matter what framework you choose. To figure out if DevOps would be the appropriate way for you, take at least the following cornerstones into account.Are you ready for DevOps?Typically, DevOps provides the most impressive results in the long term. Therefore, you need a shared understanding of goals, timeframe, level of ambition, and how much you are ready to invest before starting. You also should not forget your current competencies: to run DevOps full steam, cross-functional teams and automated platforms are required.Do you have the competencies to implement DevOps?After the decision to implement DevOps, you need cross-functional teams with enough DevOps competence. Analyse your resources and the resources of your vendors. Evaluate and compare existing competencies to those desired. You may need to assign several team members to sufficiently cover such competence needs where experts are scarce. And at the end of the day, it is likely that you won’t find enough needed competency. But this does not mean you can’t proceed – read on to see why.Does your management model drive continuous competence development?Instead of continuing to desperately seek people to fill your competency gaps, find people who can train and support others to fill the gaps. No matter how great a team you have, people will often need support in adopting the DevOps way of working in their daily work. In large-scale IT projects, the most efficient way to improve DevOps maturity has proven to be continuous competence development. Your management model needs to support this actively.Are you progressing towards a true partnership?DevOps requires common goals, which all the parties involved are committed to. A culture of trust and collaboration is a must. Contracts should enhance partnership over confrontation. As we see, partnership-based, multi-vendor ecosystems will become more and more popular in the future. A new way to manage this kind of cooperation gently, yet firmly enough, is through collaborative governance.DevOps is a model that requires us to renew in many ways.

Invisible cash: Can virtual cash management fully solve the corporate cash visibility question?,/en/blog/2022/10/invisible-cash/,Data / Torill H.  Larsen  / 17.10.2022,"If the past few years have taught treasurers one thing, it is that cash visibility is crucial to making informed treasury decisions. The ability to have account information at your fingertips whenever you want it was until recently a dream for many companies.Traditionally treasuries have found efficiencies of managing and controlling their bank accounts in conjunction with their existing banks by reducing bank accounts and possibly bank relationships too. Often this involves considerable time and expense. A Virtual Account Management (VAM) structure is a much simpler alternative. Virtual accounts are self-servicing which means that treasury departments can open, close, amend, create hierarchical structures to suit their needs with minimal effort and requirements to consult their bank. This has advantages for the corporate of course but also for banks because they don’t have to devote as much effort to corporate back-office administration and have in effect outsourced this process to their customer. Control is handed to the corporate and with that, account visibility.Visibility of course means different things to different people. Corporates are used to and have built their treasuries around visibility of their bank information which is at least a day old. The world is changing and as payments become real time in nature so too must visibility of bank balances and transaction data. Virtual account management not only supports real-time reporting but also real-time reconciliation.The ability to view up to the minute bank balances means that treasurers can react to events when they happen rather than sometime later. Real-time Ddecisions based on up the minute data are now possible and this is especially important during turbulent times such as those we are currently living through.Being able to create virtual accounts on-line and without involving the bank means that corporates can create account structures that mirror their organisation and the way they run their business. In addition, the data can be sliced and diced in any way providing central treasuries with a means of sharing real-time account information with selected entities or groups in their organisation. Those entities can see information which is relevant only to them.Real-time visibility of a treasury account structure using virtual accounts is good, but it brings additional benefits:Improved account reconciliation


Automated and real-time cash positioning


Improved ability for cash forecasting


Less reliance on manual processes and therefore reduced error rates


Reduction in the number of “real” bank accounts but still achieving accurate overviews of cash liquidity, FX currency exposures etc


Supports the concept of becoming bank agnosticReal time cash visibility, which was once a dream is now a reality thanks to virtual cash management. So, to answer question raised at the start – Yes, we do believe that virtual account cash management is a solution to the problem of cash visibility. For more on the topic, please see here", Torill H.

Transatlantic dataflow in a safe & secure manner between EU and US is now becoming a reality?,/en/blog/2022/10/transatlantic-dataflow-in-a-safe--secure-manner-between-eu-and-us-is-now-becoming-a-reality/,Cloud / Wenche Karlstad / 17.10.2022,"The announcement between the Presidents of the US and the EU Commission from March this year (2022) regarding an updated Privacy Shield, intended to make transatlantic dataflow safe and secured between the EU and the US, is now a step closer to becoming reality.The US President Biden released the Executive Order on Friday, 7 October, which was the first formal step towards an update of Privacy Shield Framework 2.0. Next, the EU Commission will need to assess the level of data protection offered by the new US framework and propose an adequacy decision in relation to the US.The EU Commission has not committed to specific timelines or deadlines for the completion of the arrangement publicly, but some journalistic sources estimate the process to take close to six months, if everything goes smoothly. The process of adopting an adequacy decision will include obtaining an opinion from the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) and a green light from a committee consisting of EU Member States representatives. Finally, the European Parliament will have the right of scrutiny over the draft adequacy decision.After the finalization of the arrangement, data will be able to flow safely between the EU and US companies certified by Department of Commerce under the new framework.Nevertheless, whether the new agreement will satisfy the European privacy requirements remains a critical question, which could be brought to and tested at the EU courts.Increasing amount of data creates growth in the data economyDue to the increasing amounts of global data, the transatlantic data flows are critical to enabling 7.1 trillion dollars in the EU-U.S. economic relationship according to the announcement from US, and global data flows now contribute more to global growth than global trade in goods.The EU Commission estimates that the volume of data produced in the world is growing rapidly, from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to an expected 175 zettabytes in 2025. Every 18 months, the amount of data is doubling.According to the EU's estimates, the value of the data economy will increase to over €550 billion by 2025, representing 4 % of the overall EU GDP.Regulations to secure our data and initiatives in Europe to boost digital sovereigntyWe must be able to trust that regulations are so good that sensitive and critical data is protected for any misuse. They should bring legal certainty to data transfer and being secured in a trusted environment to enhance digital sovereignty for businesses and countries in Europe and globally.How the EU will adopt and implement the agreement will be of high interests for the European citizens, society and businesses.Many stakeholders, including the US tech giants, are highlighting the positive aspects of the Executive Order, such as increased data privacy for European citizens and legal certainty for businesses. Some other stakeholders, including European consumer organisations, are still sceptical about whether the new agreement is sufficient to protect Europeans’ privacy and personal data.We commend the EU Commission for multiple recent initiatives to boost the European digital sovereignty and competitiveness in the global data economy.We are a member of the GAIA-X, participating in security standardisation working groups for cloud services at the Nordic and European level, and also contributing to the public discussions related to European digital sovereignty going forward.The awareness surrounding the choices of cloud solutions in a multi-cloud landscape is crucial in this respect.

Why every SAP S/4HANA transformation project needs a process mining solution? – SAP S/4HANA Vectorial,/en/blog/2022/10/why-every-sap-s4hana-transformation-project-needs-a-process-mining-solution/,NextGen Enterprise / Antti Ryysy / 14.10.2022,"While SAP S/4HANA offers an extensive list of benefits, including flexibility, lower costs, and faster analytics, many things can go sideways. SAP S/4HANA implementation is not a simple thing. In fact, it is anything but simple.Wide-scale ERP implementation is a rigorous and complex project. On the other hand, it provides an opportunity to reduce the complexity of IT systems. And as the project will cause changes to your organization, your way of working, and your systems, why not consider business efficiency improvements at the same time?Using process knowledge to deliver more business benefits from IT investmentsLeaders rightly expect that IT projects should result in a return on investment and also as business benefits. Succeeding in S/4HANA transformation requires wide and profound knowledge, understanding, and resource commitment from customers and IT suppliers.Numerous reports confirm the severity of the challenge: IT transformation projects often experience both delays and budget overruns. These setbacks are caused by the large number of changes taking place both in systems and business practices alike.The essential key to success is process knowledge. Getting a clear understanding of what really happens in your processes. Without it, your transformation project is bound to turn into a costly headache as you might end up chasing and changing the way you work based on assumptions or false understanding.Knowing the as-is processes and process variations is crucial in order to be able to transform them, manage the changes, and make sure that everything runs smoothly. The good news is that largely you have this information. Condensing it into a usable form can be difficult. Or it was difficult before SAP S/4HANA Vectorial.Process mining solution for every SAP S/4HANA transformation project – S/4HANA VectorialA lack of process understanding can cause many risks in transformation projects.

Digitalize for future energy industry success,/en/blog/2022/10/digitalize-for-future-energy-industry-success/,Digitalization / Jarmo  Roiha  / 13.10.2022,"Digitalization is the only way towards zero carbonData-driven intelligent management of both the retail and DSO business requires, first of all, a move from systems of record (basically, logging what happened or is happening) to systems of insight (being able to predict what will happen in future). To be truly data-driven, such a setup will need Artificial Intelligence and capable analytics to crunch the data collected and extract patterns from it that form the basis of forecasts.Make the data work with next-generation Customer Information Systems (CIS)Investment in new Information Technology and Operational Technology (IT & OT) is the primary way energy companies are currently adapting to market changes, as the results of Tietoevry’s Nordic Energy Industry Study 2022 highlight.The availability of real-time data is important for both retail and distribution companies. Retailers will benefit from constantly up-to-date customer and consumption data, which also allows creating new products, pricing models, services and thus, revenue streams.Available data will also enhance the customer experience from the consumer point of view, empowering consumers to follow and optimize their consumption. They can participate in the energy market by themselves or as a part of an energy community if they have their own micro-production, such as solar panels, and intelligently manage the operation and maintenance of their equipment. Retailers can of course offer this as a service.Moreover, the development of energy datahubs, currently in operation in Norway, Denmark, and Finland, enables building service and product-related ecosystems around customer and consumption data collected into one centralized place.Next-generation Customer Information Systems (CIS) sit in the middle of this new way of working. They are streamlined, modularized and cloud native capabilities managing the customer journey and, importantly, invoicing, smoothly and in real time. CIS enables customer empowerment, better self-services, improved service desk operations, and thereby an enhanced customer experience.Technology and business capability leap for Energy & UtilitiesIncreasing amounts of real-time data and simultaneously demand to lower TCO require new capabilities from the technology. Old legacy on-premise and private cloud CIS solutions don’t fulfil these new requirements any more. In order to increase scalability and performance while lowering costs, new cloud native and multitenant technologies are needed.Cyber security aspects are of the utmost importance in today’s situation. With new technologies and regular updates in multitenant environments, security in new CIS solutions will be brought to a new level meeting the highest industry standards.Moving away from customer-specific project implementations to products offered from public cloud, the time and cost of the implementation is decreased significantly. Integrations between other cloud native offerings start to be more plug-and-play type of work instead of old error hunting activities that take months.Support and maintenance of multitenant CIS solution in a cloud environment will decrease costs. Version upgrades are more regular and will be available to all customers simultaneously.For further information, please contact me, visit at our website and download your free copy of the Nordic Energy Industry Study 2022.", Jarmo  Roiha  ,Digitalization , 13.10.2022
Documentation - the blind spot of integration and API development,/en/blog/2022/10/documentation-the-blind-spot-of-integration-and-api-development/,Data / Klaus-Peter Plog / 6.10.2022,"The agile manifesto prefers a running system over extensive documentation, but having integrations documented is unavoidable. On the other hand, documentation is part of the definition of done in agile development. And yet documentation is often created on a best effort basis, which translates to minimal effort.Integration development is challenging because of several factors:Dependencies and moving parts
Stakeholders with various levels of technological understanding
Business criticality
Complex testing
Access management and security
Multitude of technologiesThe documentation of integrations comes with similar challenges such as dependencies and complexity thus producing it is not straightforward either.The many benefits of documentationSo, why should we invest time and money in the creation and maintenance of documentation?There are many reasons. Up to date information will decrease the time and also cost needed for knowledge transfer, development, testing and incident resolution. In the long term, it will also help to avoid vendor locks by increasing overall visibility.As highlighted in the Public Administration API Principles, integration and API documentation increases cooperation, reusability, interoperability, information security, data protection and quality. It is useful for both technical roles such as development, testing, support and IT security and business-oriented roles, such as operation, product owner and analyst.How, what and where do we document?The main challenge to do documentation is the nature of integrations – they are the glue in the middle – the part which connects different systems. And ultimately the ""grey area"" where things get unclear.In my experience, the following points need to be considered when planning and implementing integrations and their documentation.How and what do we document?The purpose, service level and use of the integration, plus instructions for testing
Relevant technical details
Relationship between integrations and APIs
The list and format of data transferred between systems
References to source systems / backends
Can we generate the documentation? Can we import it?
How do we keep it up to date?Where do we document?In the technical Integration environment?
In a central system like Confluence?
In a visualization tool?How do we find it?Search capabilities
Keywords
Categories
Links
Indices (can they be generated?)And finally, some suggestions which will help on the way to useful documentation:Have one place for Integration and API documentation
Invest time in the documentation structure
Make use of links and tags/labels/categories, to enable different views on the same documents
Have templates and standardize the use of tags/labels/categories
Create and update the documentation as part of the development and not only when there is time
Review the documentation and check for completeness in regular intervals
Use exports/imports from technical development environments to generate documentation

10 things you need to do to prevent cyber attacks,/en/blog/2021/10/10-things-you-need-to-do-to-prevent-cyber-attacks/,Cybersecurity insights / Aleksander Rasmussen / 3.10.2022,"“Customers are becoming less and less surprised by and more aware of their own security flaws. Customers are also more and more willing to spend money and resources on security. However, we do unfortunately still see customers that do not take security seriously and sweep flaws and risk under the carpet”, explains Aleksander Rasmussen, a security expert at TietoEVRY.Having worked for many years as a security expert and pen-tester, Aleksander knows what he is talking about. He now works at TietoEVRY as a security consultant.Pen testing is the term for the service consisting of an IT security company tasking one its ethical hackers with attempting to find vulnerabilities and flaws in a customer’s infrastructure and services.Watch out for the Netflix trickOne of the biggest cyber threats you may be exposed to either in your capacity as a private individual or an employee of an organisation is what is known as phishing. Alexander uses an example from Netflix to explain how hackers work:“You might receive a message containing a fake Netflix log-in image that asks you for your email and password. Given the busy nature of everyday life, it can be easy to click on such an image. If you look closely at the image, you will see that the web address it points to is not Netflix but a fake site set up by some hackers in Brazil, for example”, he explains.In order to stop people from falling into this trap, he recommends that organisations use a two-factor log-in process. In addition, a good security culture at your organisation and a healthy degree of scepticism are important. It is important to read who is the sender of the information in your browser to ensure you identify phishing”, explains Aleksander Rasmussen. He adds that if you are in doubt, contact someone who has expertise in the area.Hacking is a race against timeAleksander uses a number of methods to get inside customer systems.There are more and more hackers, and they know what the weakest points of businesses are.Many hackers succeed by targeting ‘end-of-life’ services, which is to say services for which security updates are no longer offered by their provider. Another typical point they look for is whether insecure passwords or standard passwords that have never been changed are being used.“Organisations need to pay close attention to obvious vulnerabilities and to close them immediately. The more time goes by, the bigger the risk that attackers will get inside.You must always ensure your house is secured with a proper lock. The longer you leave your house unlocked, the more risk there is of unwanted visitors”, adds Aleksander.The most obvious things an ethical hacker checks are whether the company is using services with known vulnerabilities or insecure configurations such as old crypto-algorithms and certificates.A slightly more advanced method is to look for openings in administrative services that are directly exposed to the internet. Examples of this are SSH, TELNET and RDP.Aleksander Rasmussen says that it is important for him as an ethical hacker to stay ahead of malicious hackers. He knows their methods and ways of thinking.But there are no magic tricks. Security work is not a question of just throwing everything at an issue when something happens, but of hard and targeted work. Organisations need to think holistically about security from a life-cycle perspective and to build security in from the very start. In order to stay one step ahead, Aleksander Rasmussen recommends following basic security hygiene such as patching and testing services. It is also important to monitor the current threat situation by following security blogs, podcasts and other sources of news.People are and will always be the weakest linkIt goes without saying and is something that is imprinted on the mind of the ethical hacker: hackers succeed because people fail to follow procedures and make mistakes. Examples include people failing to install updates or patches and people not complying with security procedures. Ethical hackers also test whether it is possible to physically enter a business and thus gain access to critical equipment and technology.“Create a good security culture internally so that employees never give out their username and password and are careful about downloading software. Awareness-raising activities and knowledge about digital threats and vulnerabilities are important, and managers need to lead by example”, explains Aleksander.The pitfalls of cloud servicesWhile cloud services have helped make many businesses’ day-to-day activities safer, this must not become a reason to relax, warns Aleksander Rasmussen.“One challenge with the cloud is not having control over the infrastructure and surrounding services, and third-party container programs are one such example. It is a known issue among hackers that this type of cloud infrastructure can contain vulnerabilities. The same applies to third-party code templates”.SolarWinds and Kaseya created a lot of concern in 2021, and we should expect more attacks of this type.“It is important to map all the data that is processed in a system or business process and to have control over how this data is stored”, comments Aleksander Rasmussen.Vulnerabilities in softwareEthical hackers look for vulnerabilities in software, and there are a number of loopholes in software that it is important to close.Aleksander Rasmussen is of the view that businesses need to monitor and set requirements for software suppliers.He highlights three challenges:Suppliers that do not take security flaws that are reported to them seriously and do not do anything with such information.
Suppliers that take legal action against security experts who report security flaws.
Suppliers that use software or services for which support or maintenance is no longer offered.A checklist for identifying vulnerabilities that need to be closed in the fight against hackersServices with known vulnerabilities
Services with insecure configurations such as old crypto-algorithms and certificates
Services with insecure or standard passwords that have never been changed
Insecure services such as TELNET or FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Services that are ‘end-of-life’ for which security updates are no longer released.
Administrative services exposed directly to the internetMeasuresCreate a good security culture internally so that employees never give out their username and password, and are cautious about downloading software

Reflections on mobile development with React Native,/en/blog/2022/09/reflections-on-mobile-development-with-react-native/,Digitalization / Konstantinos Pappas / 30.9.2022,"There are two main ways to create a mobile app: cross-platform and native.Generally speaking, with a cross-platform application it’s more difficult to reach the native features of the phone – such as the camera, or Bluetooth capability. Also, the performance of a cross-platform app seldom exceeds the performance of a native app. On the plus side, the codebase for a cross-platform app is usually smaller, as the code is reused across all the platforms the app runs on. This means fewer engineering hours are needed, which helps to keep development costs under control.There are multiple frameworks to choose from for building a cross-platform mobile app, including Flutter, Ionic and the one we will be focusing on here: React Native.Setting up a new project using React NativeYou start by visiting the official webpage (in our case: reactnative.dev) and following the instructions for setting up a development environment. At this point we already face our first dilemma: we see that if we are new to mobile development, we are advised to use the Expo CLI instead of the React Native CLI. Expo is a set of tools and services built for React Native, but as with React Native itself, Expo can be thought of as a framework and thus an abstraction layer.In computer science, abstraction layers are often used to generalize concepts and help us focus on the important details without reinventing the wheel each time we start a new project. But using too many abstraction layers may lead to complex problems. This is because we move further away from the actual implementation of how things work, making it difficult to trace the root of a problem.The next thing we need are emulators to see how our app looks on phones. These are provided by XCode and Android Studio for iPhone and Android respectively. This is where we notice the first characteristic of having an Expo application. When using the Expo Go app, we can scan a QR code that appears in the browser when we start our app on the computer. This QR code allows us to see how the app we are making looks on our phone.If we want a scalable app, the final aspect we should take care of within the setup process is automation. The first steps in automating our development process are common in web or desktop applications (e.g. code in git repos, pipelines with automated testing, etc.). The next two steps are more mobile-specific, including creating an artifact and distributing it through a mobile store. As these two steps are very platform-specific – they differentiate between iOS and Android – people often use mobile CI/CD services that have better integrations for mobile. The cool thing with Expo is that it has its own CI/CD services deeply integrated for Expo apps.(Image: Example of a development process for mobile apps)Is it worth using Expo?By creating two template projects – one with React Native CLI and one with Expo CLI – we can make an initial comparison between the project without Expo and the project with Expo. The directories generated are shown in the figure below.(Image: React Native without Expo (left), React Native with Expo (right))The first thing one notices is that the Expo template project does not contain Android and iOS folders as a bare React Native project does. That immediately means there are fewer configurations to take care of when one adds a package or creates a build. But then how do we reach the native components, such as the camera? For this Expo contains built-in modules that one can use without writing native code. This solution is not complete though, as not all native components are supported. That’s why one can eject from an Expo project to a bare React Native project and regain access to native code.One of the drawbacks of Expo is that the app size of the build is larger, as it includes some SDKs that one might not need. In addition, not all 3rd party libraries are supported and not all native APIs are available.To get a sense of the benefit of Expo, let’s take a look at a bare React Native project. Specifically, we’ll look at adding a package that contains native bridges.For this example, we can use the DateTime picker package, as many applications need it to be able to choose the date or time. It contains native bridges to the iOS spinner or Android clock. There are many different published versions of this package, so we can choose the one that best suits our needs. We follow the instructions to install it with npm or yarn, but then we must ensure that Gradle and CocoaPods are also synchronized or linked.Managing the package managersIn its latest versions, React Native has taken steps to support autolinking and to reduce the manual work one must do. Some manual work is still required though, which can be problematic. More and more packages are added in the project and many developers are working in different branches, thus it’s very likely that the synchronization between the package managers will break. The usual fixes for this are:Deleting npm packages and reinstalling. This is common in npm applications
We have more package managers now, so also deleting CocoaPods and reinstalling
Emptying caches
Erasing data and settings from emulatorsThese steps will often solve the problem and restore the synchronization, but they are time consuming. Mobile development has higher compiling and initialization times for emulators, for builds, and for runtime. Android Studio and XCode are powerful software packages, but they run heavy. If one must configure both on a regular basis in the same project, it could lead to long waiting times and high maintenance costs.The above process seems loosely related to a story from Airbnb a few years ago. The team had native versions of their application – integrated with React Native – which did not go as expected, so they switched back to native applications. Although numerous technical and organizational issues are listed, the dominant issues seem to have been the following: as native components were initially used for their application, they integrated React Native and tried to wrap the native components within it (an option one gets only in a bare React Native project, without Expo). This eventually increased complexity and maintenance time until it was no longer worth it. Having native apps seemed like a better choice. Although it is possible to include native components with a bare React Native project, it may not be optimal in the long run.Flexible planning of the projectIt’s recommended to take the time to plan the project properly and aim to get it right at the first attempt. It helps to list all the native features needed for the app, and see if there are packages that support them in React Native and in Expo. Then the team should be sized. For example, if the team consists of native developers, it could make more sense to go for a native app. If we are willing to go for a cross-platform app, we should investigate if React Native suits the case better than the alternatives.If all of the above check out and we are going for React Native, it’s recommended to use Expo. Although it’s another abstraction layer – and one should be careful with them – it seems to enhance many steps of the development process, so it’s probably safe to make an exception.-Konstantinos held a lightning talk about this topic on JavaZone 2022.

The developer debater's guide to thinking on your feet,/en/blog/2022/09/the-developer-debaters-guide-to-thinking-on-your-feet/,Meet our people / Jørn K. Baltzersen / 28.9.2022,"As a developer, you need many skills and some deep knowledge. You will attend lots of meetings with customers and users where you will often need to think quick in order to come up with the right response. Competitive debating gives you the opportunity to practice this ability to think on your feet. Debating is basically interactive public speaking, so it’s good practice that comes in handy when giving presentations and talking to customers.The debating formatA debating contest consists of two teams: a proposing team (pro) and an opposing team (con). There is also a panel of judges. In a typical debating contest, a random draw at the start assigns the opposing team and the proposing team their roles. You don’t know before the contest whether you will need to argue for or against the motion (i.e. the subject to be debated).Motions, definitions, and the boomerang effectYou may receive a list of possible motions a few days in advance, or you may get no hints at all. Motions are often set as opposites to be debated, e.g. wine is better than beer, Java is better than C#, and so on. When the motion is announced and the teams have been assigned their roles, each team gets 15 minutes to prepare before the debate starts with an opening by the proposing team.The opening includes the definition, or what you might call the requirements of the debate. In the closing, no new arguments are allowed, and the point is to state why the other team is wrong, and why one’s own team is right. As a rule of thumb, you should have three arguments. If you have fewer than three, your case may seem weak. If you have more, your opponents may choose which arguments to pick apart.Developers tend to like logical arguments, but you will rarely win a debate only with pure logic (logos). You also need to appeal to (ethical) character (ethos) – which by extension means appealing to authority – and you should appeal to feelings (pathos) too. There are a lot of ways to handle arguments. An effective method is to help the arguments of the other team become boomerangs; hitting them back in their direction. If that can’t be done, you should aim to make their arguments fall to the ground like a rock.Announcing a winnerThe judging criteria in a competition debate concern how well the motion is defined, the content of the arguments, the teams’ debating skills, their cooperation, and their time keeping. As debating is essentially role play, you are allowed to be creative in your arguments as long as they are credible. It’s important to remember to refer to the arguments of your opponents, and not to just deliver a series of independent speeches. These criteria are all good to use for presentations outside of a debate as well.As a developer, what is in it for me?How can debating help you in quick thinking, presentations, and public speaking?By practicing debating and role play, you also get practice and experience of unexpected changes and short preparation times. For example: “Your colleague Bob is sick, we need you to do a customer presentation in thirty minutes.”With a background in debating, you’re better at thinking on your feet and quickly finding counterarguments. This does not give you immunity against poor preparation or finding the right answer later on, but it does buy you some time and provide you with a set of quick-thinking skills. Debating also helps with public speaking, giving you some tools to handle and manage unexpected situations, and answer live Q&As. When you have experience as a debater can speak with more interactivity, which is better than just delivering monologues.There is the proverb: “A cobbler should stick to his last” – meaning one should do the work one is expert at. In our professional context, this means we should stick to systems development. But as a developer you still may need to present, speak, and argue in support of your work, so your arguments should emphasise your expertise.Diversifying your skills and knowledgeDiversifying your skillset is good for your development, as the mind finds connections in what may seem like irrelevant fields. You may subconsciously find new ways of looking at what you already know. In addition to the specific training, it provides in thinking quickly and public speaking, debating can also help in this expansion of your skills and knowledge.How many people have solved problems by going for a walk, a bike ride, or taking a shower? How many have had an “Eureka!” moment in a bathtub? Sometimes working too hard on a problem just may be the problem.By practicing debating and finding arguments while under pressure, you’ll be trained in thinking on your feet in no time.Jørn hosted a lightning talk on this topic on Javazone 2022, you can see his talk in full here.", Jørn K.

The five most common UX design mistakes and how to avoid making them,/en/blog/2022/09/the-five-most-common-ux-design-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-making-them/,Digitalization / Annika Herrgård / 28.9.2022,"Our advisory and design team works on strategic design with the largest private and public sector companies in Finland, with me and my colleagues working on design challenges that vary from teleoperator business to public healthcare every week.These are the five top UX mistakes we come across repeatedly. I want to share them so that you can avoid these faults and achieve a much better design outcome.1. Forgetting to establish clear goals and KPIs at the beginning of the projectSetting clear goals and KPIs is the most important phase of the project, as it steers all design tasks towards a common goal. Align the design KPI’s with your most important business goals. This will help the entire team to effectively take the service towards the desired outcome.2. Adding too many user actions before the goal you want people to completeThink of the most important goals and actions on the website and emphasize those with CTAs. If you want your user to perform a specific action, do not include too many steps on the path to that goal. The CTAs should also have a strong visual emphasis, and they should be quite high up on the page. If you have a registration or subscription, also include a light version with a quick checkout option.3. Inventing the wheel all over againDo not forget to borrow the best ideas! Benchmarking is a great tool in the ideation process when you come up with potential solutions to your problems. You can also look at leading solutions from completely other fields and apply the best ideas to your business.Another related point is Jakob’s Law: users expect similarity across all digital services. Since they spend time on various sites, they prefer your site to work the same way as all other sites they already know. Benchmarking with the best solutions will also help provide similar user logic as in the industry standard.4. Failing to include real users in the design processSometimes organizations think they know what real users need, and so they decide to design merely on gut feeling. I can assure you that this is not an effective way to craft high-quality design. Real users should be included both in the insight-gathering phase and during prototyping where you test how well the design functions in real life. I have not seen a single project where user feedback would not have brought remarkable insights.My favorite way to include users in the design process is through interviewing, performing user tests and analyzing online behavioral and heuristic data and analytics. Also, user personas are a wonderful way to bring the user to the center of the design process.5. Designing the same components again and againFigma and other modern design programs make it easy to craft a design system that includes re-usable components and other visual elements. This not only makes design faster, but also ensures a coherent layout across the website. Giving your design team the right tools for the job is a prerogative.So, there you have it – the top five mistakes to guard against in UX design. I guarantee that if you watch out for these pitfalls, then you are going to be much more able to provide a future-proof user experience that delights existing and new customers alike.Do you want to hear more?

The importance of making sustainable choices in all aspects of life,/en/blog/2022/09/the-importance-of-making-sustainable-choices-in-all-aspects-of-life/,Sustainability / Magnus Mühlenbock / 27.9.2022,"In our family, we take sustainability seriously and let circular principles guide our daily decisions. Here are a few examples of sustainability from my family and our household. We have been driving an electric car for the past five years. We charge it when the electricity grid is not used – at night, for example. This year we drove from Stockholm to Berlin for the Easter holiday, and earlier we even travelled to London with our electric car. We prefer taking the train for shorter holidays, whenever possible. In our home, we have smart lighting. It’s part of our everyday life to sort the garbage into glass, paper, plastic and metal, and we’ve chosen to buy sustainably made clothes with classic designs that will last longer than fast fashion. When we buy new kitchenware, quality materials such as cast iron will always win over items that would need to be replaced more often. When we’re planning meals that include meat, a nose-to-tail approach is the one we go for. This means choosing less popular cuts of meat. On a community level, I am the chairman of our housing association where we are driving several circularity topics for all forty-nine households. Heating and electricity are our main focus areas. What is then that motivates us as citizens to think and act more sustainably? This is an important question to tackle in the green shift, as all societal transformations require a mindset change and new behaviors from each and every one of us. Nordic citizen survey shows: More knowledge required to make the green shiftWe are committed to recycling 100% of devicesIt’s important to me to make these conscious choices not only personally, but also professionally. This is why our Group CIO department revised and improved our Device Return Process. We started with the device return process in 2008 as part of the former EVRY Sweden. Our processes were improved using agile methods, enabling us to return 99% of all devices and reuse them within their lifecycle. At the end of a device’s life, it’s returned to an external partner to be refurbished and sold on the market. Now we are scaling this device return experience from Sweden to all large geolocations in Tietoevry. To be able to scale this efficiently, we had to change several core processes within both HR and Procurement. Two people in my team have also spent a considerable amount of time solving the logistical challenges. Surprisingly, getting a box from A to B has been the most challenging part of this initiative. Reminding our colleagues what they must do is a big part of making this work, so we have even nicknamed our internal process ‘Nagging as a Service’. On a more serious note, we want to enable the managers and employees to make the right choice, but ultimately the responsibility and accountability lie with each of us as an individual. We are also targeting the new device selection process, where we want to include circularity before selecting a new standard for the company. In 2023, we commit to recycling 100% of Tietoevry hardware – this includes our own devices as well as those provided to customers. We have also factored in the CO2 compensation for all the new devices that we buy. Read more on our circular economy practices in Tietoevry's sustainability report 2021By doing all this, we want to make sure our colleagues make a conscious choice in our work environment to reuse, recycle properly and think about our planet.", Magnus Mühlenbock ,Sustainability , 27.9.2022
Advancing Trust-Based Digital Societies,/en/blog/2022/09/veturi-advancing-trust-based-digital-societies/,Digitalization / Iftikhar Ahmad / 26.9.2022,"With the disruption, also new threats are emerging. The technologies can be misused, the security of the systems and data compromised, creating wide-reaching implications at individual and societal level. To prevent and mitigate the threats new innovations that promote trust are required. There is a real need for trusted digital services in society especially in financial, health & social care and energy sector, along with all critical infrastructure. Through the Tietoevry Veturi program, Trusted Digital Societies, we aim to drive the global transformation and create a benchmark for affordable, accessible, and trusted digital services for citizens globally.Market dominated by big players and regulationThe digital world is being dominated by few global players, who have expanded their reach into different areas of society. This oligopoly is not without problems, especially when few players (companies) originate from Europe, and do not have the same legal or societal base. The EU (European Union)-level regulation – General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), medical device regulation and the new draft Artificial Intelligence Act for example – creates boundaries for businesses on how the technologies should be used, but also create opportunities to those able to offer solutions for addressing existing and future challenges.Secure communication is vital in the age of Industry 4.0 & 5.0Next generation (5G/6G) connectivity is bringing new features such as low latency, location etc. But it is not only social media browsing and faster audiovisual content streaming. It is going beyond that and will transform the society and will impact each corner such as industry, finance, health & wellbeing, entertainment etc. In the new connectivity low latency combined with guaranteed band will have an enormous impact on digital services. In the case of industry 4.0 and beyond, it will not only change the industry equipment size but efficiency significantly.Especially indoor location added with connectivity will have an enormous impact on industry automation and raise many Security and Privacy concerns. Currently industry is using mostly wired connectivity with Internet-Of-Things (IoTs) and enjoying security gap. This gap will be evaporated with 5G/6G connectivity even in private networks. As the 5G/6G connectivity signal will be in the air, it can be detected even outside the industry area. At least the connectivity duration and time of the connection is available to a third-party listener. It will reveal the industry working time and duration up to some extent. Besides security and privacy of factory functioning, privacy of an individual working in the 5G/6G connectivity can also be tracked more precisely as indoor location is embedded in the signal.AI must be human-centric and trustworthy5G/6G connectivity will bring new possibilities for industry automation and safety of the individual working in the area. Automation will have more autonomous components that will heavily depend on Artificial Intelligence (AI). It raises the importance of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in a different context.Human and AI interaction is one of the main aspects. How do we train the AI models for different tasks or retrain (fine-tune) it? What kind of data is used? It is vital to understand the bias in the data along with the bonds and limitations of the data used in either training/re-training/fine-tuning. As most of the models are working in a narrow area (or few tasks), it is important to understand the working of the AI model in the narrow area, but it is vital to comprehend the working of it in the overflow areas or related areas (in the exceptional use-cases). AI models must work well (degrade gracefully) and neither cause any harm to the equipment nor to the environment where they are operating. At depth we are looking for a trustworthy AI that is robust, stable, explainable, unbiased, and generalized.It can be achieved by using trusted reliable digital services with secure communication and trustworthy AI that will be compliant with EU values and regulations. For that we suggest using external third-party audit for the offering (digital services) along with opensource data and AI platform which will build the transparency and trust on the offering.Join the ecosystem!The changing digital world creates new opportunities for those able to offer trusted digital services in society especially in financial, health/social care and energy sector, along with all critical infrastructures.In the Veturi programme, Tietoevry is initiating research collaboration in horizontal technologies – including trustworthy AI and secure communications – to enable long-term business infrastructure, to establish common technology-specific platforms and to ensure compliance to EU-level acts and regulations. We welcome companies, start-ups and research groups to join the ecosystem for building joint technology capabilities around the strategic themes.", Iftikhar Ahmad ,Digitalization , 26.9.2022
Achieve sales target in most profitable way with Sales Optimizer,/en/blog/2022/09/achieve-sales-targets-profitably-with-sales-optimizer/,Data / Aleksandr Peussa  / 22.9.2022,"One such innovative product is Sales Optimizer, which is helping banks overcome the Catch 22 of the lending business, namely, how to meet sales and profit targets while upholding risk appetite. The modularity and scalability of this cloud-native solution makes the onboarding process fast and efficient, allowing banks and their customers to benefit from the solution from day one.Lending business triangleIt is simple economics; the higher the interest rate, the higher the potential profit margins. However, with that comes lower sales volumes as loanees choose competitors. The same applies to credit risk appetite. The stricter the credit policy, the smaller the credit losses but, at the same time, sales suffer due to low credit approval rates. In the language of mathematics, the bank faces a multidimensional optimization problem with several variables affecting each other. Yet another challenge is customer churn driven by the growth of aggressive competitors in ever more crowded market.The foundation of Sales Optimizer lies in the lending business triangleThe AI sweet spotMany banks struggle to find the optimal trade-off between sales volume, profit margin, and credit risk appetite. It is critical for businesses to grow, but not at the expense of squeezed profit margins. For banks, it’s even more acute as, in addition to the “traditional” costs of a normal business ecosystem, banks are tied to credit losses and Basel accords which define capital requirements and impact the profitability of invested capital. This poses a considerable challenge for the human (brain) but presents a vast opportunity for AI.Sales Optimizer combines business domain knowledge, cutting-edge cloud-native technology and the latest academic data science research. Advanced mathematical modelling enables it to overcome the multidimensional optimization issue and deliver smart portfolio optimization. Additionally, modern machine learning appraises the portfolio on a quantitative, customer-by-customer basis, defining price elasticity level, and estimating churn and credit risk probabilities, among other things. These unique capabilities make Sales Optimizer a business critical tool for banks that wish to grow market share while maximizing return on equity.Sales Optimizer for your targetsSales Optimizer analyzes potential profitability levels based on your sales targets and the current market conditions, and suggests the most profitable way for you to reach your sales targets. To do this, it applies an individualized price elasticity principle, in the form of a dynamic pricing model that ensures your target audience receives the best deals, while minimizing the bank’s credit risks.The big pictureIn today’s uncertain times, we need to look to innovative technology to meet the needs of customers, uphold banks’ profitability and help drive the economy forward. Tools such as Sales Optimizer do just that. As more banks onboard the technology, the industry as a whole will be able to offer customers more sustainable bank loans without eating away unnecessarily at profit margins. And lower interest rates for end customers is ultimately beneficial for both household economies and for society as it stimulates economic growth.If you want to hear more about our AI-based solutions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

An industrial IT solution that pays itself back in one shift – fact or fiction?,/en/blog/2022/09/an-industrial-it-solution-that-pays-itself-back-in-one-shift--fact-or-fiction/,Data / Marko  Jämsen  / 21.9.2022,"Efficient Operations Management is one of the key issues that keep the management of industrial companies awake at night. Would it not be a relief to know a solution exists for production monitoring and information-sharing that not only increases your profit, but pays itself back within one shift? Unbelievable? Read on.The pulp, paper and fibre industry is no exception to the trend affecting all manufacturing companies in today’s competitive business environment and under a constant cost squeeze – optimize, optimize, optimize.A Nordic forest industry conglomerate, therefore, started looking for a harmonized IT solution that could replace their disparate production optimization systems nearing their end of life. A market study quickly revealed no software vendor had such a system on offer.To the drawing board, then, with a trusted IT partner.Digitalizing mill workflows was the first objective, using the huge amounts of data the machinery provides, and combining it with information-sharing capabilities between staff members.Collaboration between teams was the natural result of making sense of data. Production and maintenance needed to be on the same page to cooperate and reconcile their respective operations. The solution also needed to be integrated with the SAP PM system handling maintenance notifications through an easy-to-use interface, and SAP Quality module to handle customer claims.The efficiencies sought were harmonization of systems across mills, plus efficient production monitoring with collaboration especially between production and maintenance teams.Whiteboard the gate to all functionsAn intuitive Whiteboard was created for a main view of all the functionalities available. They appear under their respective tabs, with drill-down possibilities.This view gives one-click access to logs, events, the Morning Meeting function, tasks and instructions to operators, maintenance requests and work permits, root cause analyses, and even a short messaging system for all users.Process view – the Money MakerThe process view, an alternative user interface into mill data, is the real money-maker. Thanks to the underlying digitalization, it shows real-time machine production target and actual production as trend, as well as other parameters. It also shows the digitalized events together with their status updates on a dashboard timeline. This creates a connection between the events and production monitoring, as well as between the operators and maintenance as operators can see what is going on and easily create and follow maintenance requests.The process view also collects stats that enable more far-reaching decisions, such as maintenance planning and investment needs calculations.Boatload of benefitsIntuitive and easy to use, the solution – TIPS Operations Management System – OMS for short, provides an interface between mill floor systems and SAP, so personnel do not need to learn how SAP works. This is particularly important with regard to maintenance, as maintenance requests and instructions between operators and maintenance personnel are processed in SAP PM with which OMS integrates natively.OMS also includes a native mobile app for added flexibility.Besides helping optimize production and producing huge savings in maintenance, the OMS solution has a remarkably short payback time. As a Mill Production Manager spontaneously put it:“Return on investment? The first shift after OMS start-up!”The example outlined here is from the pulp, paper, and fibre industry, but OMS lends itself quite as well to any production or process industry.To find out more about OMS, visit our website – or better still, hear what our client has to say by registering for the International Conference for Forest Products, Paper and Packaging, Madrid, Spain, on 27–29 September, or contact us.", Marko  Jämsen  ,Data , 21.9.2022
Why digital sovereignty is increasingly important,/en/blog/2022/09/why-digital-sovereignty-is-increasingly-important/,Cloud / Wenche Karlstad / 20.9.2022,"The right cloud for the right data has, therefore, never been more critical. It is important to protect sensitive data, but at the same time to allow data sharing in a secured network. Digital sovereignty is a key concept in this respect. Digital sovereignty is necessary to secure and protect our digital assets. In practice, it is about access to data, where it is located, where it moves, and who has the jurisdictional control. These are critical questions for a modern data economy. In a debate during Arendalsuka, Knut Karper-Bjørgaas (Department Director of Digital Strategy and Communication, Directorate of Digitalisation), Øyvind Eidissen, (Partner and Lawyer, the law firm Schjødt), and Wenche Karlstad (Head of Strategic Differentiation Programs, Tietoevry Connect) highlighted the issue. The debaters emphasized the importance of guarding the data as individuals, companies, social institutions, and Norway as a nation. Øyvind Eidissen at Schjødt Law firm also believes that the core concept is to have control over storage and access to our own data, whether it concerns personal data or other proprietary data. According to his experience, the most significant challenges related to digital sovereignty result from a complex legal landscape and rapid technological development that constantly complicate current legal guidelines.Increasing awarenessWhat does GDPR, the Cloud Act, the Schrems II judgment and other regulations mean for Norwegian businesses and the public sector's choice of cloud solutions? And how should one deal with the different regulations? These are two of the most central questions. The impression Wenche is left with after the event is that awareness around digital sovereignty is increasing. But it is complicated and time-consuming to keep up to date. It is, therefore, essential that both the industry and the authorities contribute with clear guidelines, and with concrete advice based on the applicable framework. This would be an effort about distinguishing between types of data, for instance critical and open industrial data, and finding concrete solutions for the right purpose and the right cloud storage. Karlstad and Eidissen believe that an action is needed to reduce the competence gap between large and small players. Eidissen believes that demands for specialist expertise, in complex legal and technical issues, require resources that are difficult for smaller businesses to possess themselves. This naturally means that the need for external assistance will increase. In this respect, it is encouraging that several public agencies have recently taken the initiative to establish guides for various user groups on behalf of the government, for example, the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency initiated work with a guide for good practice following the EU Court of Justice's Schrems II decision.New initiativesThe uncertainty surrounding changing rules is entirely natural. Not only are the EU regulations changing, but also the Nordic countries have a different approach. The EU is taking necessary regulatory measures on the other hand, to protect us in Norway as a result of EEA membership. By the end of the year, there will be an updated Privacy Shield from the European Commission. The EU organization ENISA is working on specifying requirements for different degrees of sovereignty for cloud services which can be clarifying for the industry, organizations, and businesses. The principles of sovereignty will affect everyone who stores data in the cloud, which primarily has consequences for those who need to handle data at a high level of security. The major American cloud providers still want to deliver their services in Europe. For example, this summer, Microsoft announced that they will offer solutions in line with stricter European regulations. This means that not only their data centers will be in Europe, but also, they must operate with support functions in Europe to meet new requirements for sovereignty, within their partner programs.Facilitating innovation is a must!So, which steps are most important for Norwegian businesses to take to ensure digital sovereignty develops in the future? Eidissen encourages the acquisition of the necessary expertise to provide the proper framework for the assessments of individual businesses. Don't be too cautious about the opportunities to think innovatively and adopt desired solutions. In most cases, there are promising solutions, and the possibilities are far more than many think. But the right expertise is needed when making solid risk assessments. Wenche supports that in Norway, we generally have a high level of maturity and great innovative force in digitalising services for citizens and society. The competence is also good compared to many other countries. The challenge is that small and medium-sized players must have the same conditions as the large ones. It is mainly about providing incentives to promote innovation and growth as well as facilitating the sharing of protected data in a trust-based infrastructure. If you want to share data, including health data, you must be sure that the technical systems ensure that such data does not go astray. Data is a resource that can and should be shared assuming that you do it right. And we must take advantage of the opportunities it provides, such as adopting new smart technology.Opportunities and pitfallsIn a time where cyber-attacks are increasing, and new opportunities can also create new pitfalls - are Norwegian companies running greater risks than they did before? Or are they, on the contrary, better prepared? Eidissen believes that in some areas there is probably no getting away from the fact that the risk, both in terms of regulations and actions, is greater today than in the past. Big data, increased data traffic across national borders, increased international intelligence activities and the GDPR's sanctioning regime are keywords that most people will be familiar with. In addition to this, there is security policy unrest in the world community now. At the same time, this is not black and white, as many businesses are better equipped than ever to make correct risk assessments and make well-considered choices that can enable continued innovation and development. In a survey by IDC, almost two out of three decision-makers in regulated industries say that it is essential to have cloud solutions that provide full control and authority over data. We must be able to trust that the rules are so good that you must not give other countries' authorities access to sensitive data and that you classify data in a way that ensures the necessary control. The awareness surrounding the choice of cloud solutions in a multi-cloud landscape is crucial in this respect. It is ultimately about taking ownership of the value of data and our businesses, says Karlstad.", Wenche Karlstad ,Cloud , 20.9.2022
"When to apply Integration, RPA, and Intelligent Automation in the transformation journey",/en/blog/2022/09/when-to-apply-integration-rpa-and-intelligent-automation/,Data / Abhijit Joshi / 19.9.2022,"In my last blog, I talked about the need for Integration, RPA, and Intelligent Automation (IRIA) to work together. Now, let us explore the reusable decision matrix tool to make choices among multiple technology groups like Integration, RPA, and Intelligent automation and tools like Azure Integration services, Uipath etc.In this blog you will learn:Why we need a decision matrix
Applying the decision matrix in a business context
Example of a 1st layer decision matrix: Technology group choice
Example of a 2nd layer decision matrix: The feasability check
Example of a 3rd layer decision matrix: Tool choices from the technology group
Conclusion and answering the question; will you be able to build, use and justify a reusable decision matrix to decide when to use IRIA?Let us first understand why we need a decision matrix with an analogyIf you happen to be the parent of a very young child, you will recognize an exciting pattern they depict while creating their own Lego World.Let us assume your child is building a house, car, or castle; let us call it a structure. In the first attempt, the child moves quickly by putting a random and easy combination of pieces together, but in most cases, the child struggles to find the matching pieces to put together after completing about 80% of the structure.As a remedy, the child will try various combinations of the remaining pieces to force-fit into the structure. This is a futile attempt to complete the structure.After taking a small break (crying or not crying) or parental intervention, they will break the 80% built structure and then quickly and successfully rebuild the entire thing by ensuring the proper combination of pieces from the start instead of the random and easy combination of the pieces.You may ask, what has changed in the second attempt? And the answer is, consciously or unconsciously, the child applies their learning from the first attempt by asking themselves the right questions (what is the correct combination of pieces) from the start. What this tells us, is that it is imperative to ask the correct questions in order to find an appropriate answer. Asking the right questions can make you come to better decisions faster.Now you will ask me how this example relates to “when to apply IRIA in the Transformation journey.” We can depict the answer in the following form:Business needs
High level requirements
Correct questions/headers on ""AS IS environment""
Quantifiable answers
List of essential attributes for proposed technology tool based on weightage numbers
Scores based on answers ranges and weightage numbers
Comparison of the resulted list of details vs. features of technology or tool available in the market
Result of choice of technology or toolsApplying the decision matrix in a business contextLet us apply this to our context; we can assume your organization has a diverse set of mix generation applications. Multiple applications participating in the core business processes needs to perform various operations while interacting with each other.In this example, let's say that you have framed a very high-level requirement that the organization wants to improve two business processes to deliver a 35% reduction in efforts and processing time with a nominal investment, i.e., minimal investment and maximum ROI within a couple of quarters.Now, you got a toolset, scope, timeline, KPI, and budget.Let us deep dive, validate the assumptions, and frame the decision matrix for technology choices. If you do some research, you will find plenty of questions to be asked; unfortunately, we cannot look at all questions in this blog but let us look at the themes of questions that need to be answered to form a decision matrix.Application Attributes
Data Attributes
Operations Attributes (Manual/data etc.)
Interface Attributes (touchpoints etc.)
Execution Attributes (Frequency/runtime etc.)
Limitation, Constraints, and Compliances
Human Capital Engagement
Business Process AttributesNow you have a good list of questions. You might notice that all questions are driven by environmental factors of the AS-IS landscape, i.e., current application, business process, and task settings. Based on correct and essential questions, let us visualize how the decision matrix should look like.We can safely imagine the decision matrix in three layers. Following are the three layers of the reusable decision matrix some of the industry players are using:Technology group choice
Feasibility check
Tool choice from the technology groupLet us look at the sample of a 1st layer decision matrix - Technology group choicePlease find one of the sample decision matrices used by an industry player, which should give you enough indicators of a suitable choice of technology group for assigned tasks.Click the image to enlargeIn this layer, you can detect the limitations and strengths of a technology group and its application in business processes and given tasks. You can use an as-is matrix (shown in the picture) with your suitable weightage multipliers, headers, and range label. The weightage multiplier helps you with “the score” calculated with the type of range and header.You may ask how to identify the score of the answer; let us assume we only consider three headers/questions. Please note summation of all weights or Ranges should be 1.0 = (0.5+0.3+0.2/0.12+0.33+0.55). Now you got a list of essential attributes of the proposed technology, i.e., the Header in the above picture. Here we can call Implementation complexity an essential header.Let us calculate for example the Implementation Complexity score with different ranges; like the Low range, the score is 0.5*0.55 = 0.275. The medium range score is 0.181, and the high range score is 0.060. Once we have all scores, you need to list Technology groups and tools with their features, strengths, and weaknesses.When you have the features or attributes of market available technology groups and tools, you can compare the list based on the score from the first layer of the decision matrix. As an example; based on your architectural assessment, if Technology group A has medium implementation complexity and full scalability and stability (score 0.440), then it is chosen over Technology group B with low implementation complexity and partial scalability and low stability (0.398).Let us look at the sample of a 2nd layer decision matrix – The feasibility checkThis layer will check the viability of implementing the determined (in the previous layer) technology-based solution.Click the image to enlargeAny transformation project poses some level of risk. The feasibility check matrix helps us examine potential risks to determine whether they are worth taking. A detailed feasibility check can distinguish real saving or revenue opportunities from transformation projects/investments that could fail.Let us look at the sample of a 3rd layer decision matrix - Tool choices from the technology groupThis layer will help you identify a suitable tool within a specific application group.For example, if we want to choose an integration tool, then the matrix shown in the picture can be used in partial or complete form to make a decision.Click the image to enlargePlease be advised that in the sample matrix, only essential headers are shown, but you may add a few more headers or areas to make the decision.With the three-layered reusable decision matrix, you can institutionalize the decision of when to use Integration, RPA, and Intelligent Automation during digital transformation projects.In practice, it will work like this:In the first layer, you will be able to identify the Integration technology to be used in the project based on headers like implementation complexity, number of steps with manual intervention, type of manual intervention etc.
The second layer will give you a result telling the high feasibility of success while implementing the integration solution based on headers like error tolerance level, parallel activities to be performed, data and info availability etc.
With the third layer, you can conclude that Azure Integration service is the tool to be used in the project based on headers like type of underline framework, data integration type, number of ready-to-use connectors, API design, and lifecycle management etc.In conclusion, will you be able to build, use and justify a reusable decision matrix to decide when to use IRIA?The answer is yes. We can see that the three-layered reusable decision matrix can be used to make appropriate tech and tool choices. Building a reusable decision matrix tool will give you an unbiased and quantitative indication of suitable technology and tool. Not doing that puts your transformation program at a risk of likely failing.Even though the blog’s scope is IRIA, the lessons apply to a broader group of technologies. Based on our experience, the large-scale transformation experience is essential to success. We at Tietoevry have a solid capability to advise in the digital transformation journey.

"Why does synchronized Integration, RPA, and Intelligent Automation (IRIA) need to work together?",/en/blog/2022/09/why-does-synchronized-integration-rpa-and-intelligent-automation-iria-need-to-work-together/,Data / Abhijit Joshi / 2.9.2022,"In our overall experience, we found three primary business needs being expressed across different industries:Reducing cost, operational time, and manual efforts in existing business processes
Improving customer experience and, subsequently, revenue
Improving the quality of business processes and increase employee happinessThese business needs refer to improving business processes on an existing set of applications. There are various types of applications involved in a transformation journey. In this blog, let us focus on three large groups of applications.Integration includes all sorts of integration through API and middleware
RPA includes all sorts of process automation like RPA Low code & No code, Open source etc.
Intelligent automation includes solutions built on a combination of other tools and intelligent algorithms, and frameworks like Machine Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision etc.For simplicity’s sake, let us call them IRIA, i.e., Integration, RPA, and Intelligent Automation.Every organization has invested in some form of integration and automation product(s)Look at your organizational application landscape with a narrow vision on integration and automation products and ask the following critical questions to yourself:Are you able to extract the full value from the investment?
Are the products working tightly together to deliver more value?
Are the existing products individually expensive to operate?If you have tried to answer the above questions, you would conclude there are more potential benefits to be realized by building synergies within these three technology groups; improved efficiency and effectiveness as well as reduced costs. When used in concert, they can help companies transform business by quickly transferring data with task automation, communication, and automation of processes across the business flows.This is the first blog in a series where you will learn more about the synergies and values achieved when IRIA is working together. Starting with the why. Keep reading to learn:Does a Integration, RPA, and Intelligent Automation combination make sense? Potental benefits that can be achieved by using IRIA together
Example of a possible solution with IRIA for your business needs
The challenges of using IRIA together and how to overcome those challengesLet us answer the first question of why a Integration, RPA, and Intelligent Automation combination make sense and what the benefits areEveryone in the industry loves to talk about numbers so let us look at them. The solution consisting of IRIA can result in a significant increase in productivity (+30%-40%), reduce license costs (-20%-40%) as well as a reduction in human error (-65%-80%).Additionally, by automating tasks, businesses can free up employee time to focus on more value-added activities resulting in the growth of employee happiness and customer satisfaction.Please note that all the numbers mentioned in the article are based on our varied types of customer implementation experiences.Let’s now focus on exploring possible solutions with IRIA for your business needsLet us explore the IRIA-based solution with the analogy of the Stockholm transit system, which includes metro, buses, and more.Imagine your Integration application transferring data like the Stockholm metro with characteristics like short, fixed stops and high availability.Your RPA applications are like mid-tier connectivity, such as Stockholm buses and taxies, with attributes like short, flexible routes and high availability.Your Intelligent Automation applications are like last mile connectivity, same as an E-Scooter, E-cycle, walk or having your own car with attributes like a personalized vehicle, fully flexible, and 24x7 availability.With the above analogy, you need all three modes of vehicles working together to complete the travel between your home and your office. i.e., If you want to complete the transformation journey, it is imperative to use a combination of Integration, RPA, and Intelligent Automation IRIA.The solution you need to build should haveAn integration component transferring data between two applications or data sources
An automation component automating manual process around the source and target application or data source
And intelligent automation automating activities like decision making, prediction, and classification etc.Magic happens when Integration does a fantastic job of fast and accurate data transfer. And just before data transfer, RPA performs data operations/processing activities (collect/validate/write/update/reconcile) at the source and target application levels.Suppose you add intelligent automation of complex decision-making activities based on events or predict future events based on historical data. In that case, you have an almost end-to-end automated business process with a lot of savings and happy employees and customers.In addition, the IRIA combination essentially helps streamline data-related activities like operations, quality check, refinement, and transfer, giving the benefits of achieving the objective of a data-driven organization.Now, let's look at the answer to the last question referring the challenges of using IRIA together - and how to overcome those challengesThe biggest challenge in building an IRIA-based solution is the decision of where/when to use Intelligent Automation, RPA, and Integration – considering that all these technologies have considerable overlap in terms of capabilities. I go more into depth, and provide a concrete tool to use to determine when to use IRIA in my second blog.Some architects may feel that there is no requirement for three technologies that can be consolidated into one. But based on our on-ground experience, most companies use all these technologies based on their core strengths. We have seen our customers maintaining a weighted decision matrix to make technology choices.The decision matrix will include critical factors like data volume, process frequency, type of data, Return on Investment, license cost...etc. We will talk about the decision matrix in detail in my next blog. If you are interested in knowing the decision matrix, then please follow the series. Solution designers should choose technologies appropriate to a business solution that needs to be based on that decision matrix.In conclusion, do we feel it is worth it?The answer is yes. We can see that using Integration, RPA, and Intelligent Automation (IRIA) together can help organizations achieve their desired business goals more efficiently and effectively.However, the abovementioned challenges must be overcome while implementing such solutions. But if they are adequately addressed, the benefits of using Integration, RPA, and Intelligent Automation together far outweigh the challenges.Now you will say it is easier to say than successfully execute it.

Servitization in manufacturing demystified: Learnings from growing service business,/en/blog/2022/09/servitization-in-manufacturing-demystified-learnings-from-growing-service-business/,Digitalization / Rory Moore / 1.9.2022,"In this article you will learn:What are typical challenges manufacturing industry companies encounter in their servitization journey
Why roadmap for servitization is so important
Key servitization learnings along with changing the service business model
Towards profitable service business
How do we work around servitizationWhat is Servitization?In my 22-year professional career working with manufacturing companies, I have seen a plethora of different definitions and interpretations of what servitization is. In its most simple base form, servitization is the selling of the outcome of the machine: assets, objects, things etc. The most well-known example, and often over-used, is the ‘Power by the Hour’ or “Pay by Hour” maintenance service agreement used for aircraft engines. Other more industrial examples are:Lifting Capacity – paying for tonnes lifted per hour/shift by a crane
Shaft Rotation – hydraulic power unit and motor turning a shaft for a feeder belt on a mine with a specific payment for Nm of torque and speed
Rock Crushing – Paying for the volume and quality of the aggregate end-productHowever, the ‘fluffiness’ around servitization as a topic in the manufacturing industry stems not from defining the outcome to be sold, but rather ‘how’ to get to the point of changing your service business model so that selling an outcome becomes a reality.Servitization challenges in the manufacturing industryThere are multiple (recurring) challenges in the manufacturing industry that I have seen and experienced that can become showstoppers or threats to a servitization journey:Lack of a defined business model that clearly describes how revenue will be generated
Lack of a defined service portfolio roadmap that matches the ambition of selling outcome and performance
Siloed service customer approaches and service delivery channels
Risk management for both the financial agreement and also the capital asset performance
A lack of structured digital & service data capabilitiesUltimately, it is a non-linear journey, especially so for well-established machinery and equipment manufacturers with a long service and aftermarket legacy. However, if navigated successfully servitization as a business model holds amazing new business opportunities for the manufacturing industry and unlocks new levels of growth, competitiveness, and revenue. Your servitization journey can only be properly navigated with a starting roadmap based on the reality of your service business today.Servitization needs a roadmapIn my work, I’ve been part of advising and developing advanced service portfolios for Nordic manufacturers. I have learned that you can significantly increase the chances of successful service business model change if you create a servitization roadmap. This roadmap can either focus on one area of your service portfolio (and specific customer types), or it can also look at the big-picture view of your service offerings. Either way, the roadmap must be rooted in a realistic starting point of what capabilities and offerings you have today and then committing to the needed capabilities (stepwise) to the point where you can ‘servitize’ an offering. These service delivery capabilities can only be identified when you have a roadmap that you believe is grounded in how you do business today.One aspect of the work we do with our Nordic clients is to help them to define their starting service portfolio and then also create a ‘wish-list’ of future offerings. Then we map these current and new service offerings according to what they feel they can sell; today, tomorrow (+3 years) and in the future (+5 years).Click image to enlargeExample Service Business Model Change Roadmap – Foundational, Advanced, Outcome and Eco-system Driven Maturity.As with any service portfolio, this is not a linear move from left to right (on the graphic), but rather a strategic picking of must-win battles based on what we know will create new revenue for you and also value for your end-customers.Key servitization roadmap learningsThe nuances and intricacies of the servitization roadmap in manufacturing are different for each organization, but some key takeaways and learnings can be derived from our experience thus far:Create a servitization roadmap starting point based on what services you sell and capabilities you have today.
Define the roadmap targets based on ROI and customer/market expectations.
In order to get buy-in from all stakeholders (internal and customers), a servitization roadmap will help to change the mindset.
Don’t boil the ocean but do determine the priority of the must-win battles.
Don’t leave good profitable businesses behind. There will always be a portion of your markets that will only want traditional/foundational services.
Keep on experimenting and developing your advanced digital capabilities such as Industrial IoT, digital customer channels, and data analytics. This is your foundation to innovate and manage your risks before you offer outcome-driven services.Service business digitalization and commercializationIt can often be a challenge to prioritize the need to bring (or pilot) a new advanced digital service offering to the market and find a way to monetize it. Service business model change in the manufacturing industry is hard, and it does not happen overnight. There are different philosophies and ways to think about this, but I subscribe to the servitization approach that you should be patient with the technology, but impatient with revenue.What this means in real terms is that, as with any new digital technologies and capabilities, (e.g., analytics, predictive maintenance, digital service channels, etc), there is a learning curve, and the ROI can at the start be somewhat subjective. Those manufacturing companies that invest with a realistic servitization roadmap in place find themselves moving towards outcome-driven services in a much faster and risk-mitigated manner compared to their peers.How do we work around servitization?Tietoevry is the partner of choice for many Nordic machinery and equipment manufacturers as we understand core service business needs and how digitalization impacts the business.

“I have “a-ha” moments every day”,/en/blog/2022/08/i-have-aha-moments-every-day/,Meet our people / Recruitment  Team / 30.8.2022,"You recently made a career change, from social worker to IT developer. Could you tell us about that?“My mum works in social care and my dad has had a career in IT, so I have heard a lot about both these areas. I’ve basically always had one foot in each world. I came to a career crossroads where I felt I had done what I wanted to do in terms of social work, and it felt like a natural step to shift to programming, as I am basically quite a logical person.”How did you end up at Tietoevry?“When I started studying, one of my goals was to work at Tietoevry in Kalmar. I had read about the company and knew that it had built systems with a focus on societal benefits, in other words the sort of systems I had worked with before, so I was naturally curious. I considered Tietoevry to be a serious company in which there are lots of opportunities to develop in one’s professional role, and this attracted me.”How does the new world at Tietoevry feel?“I started here in October 2021 and have felt very welcome, with good support from colleagues and the organisation. A relatively large part of my initial time here has been spent working with local small businesses and digitalisation projects. This has been a good first step and onboarding process that has suited me very well,” she comments, adding that she has also become involved in a larger project that uses technology to combat bullying in schools – with the help of “digital twins”.Could you tell us a bit about that project?“It is a Vinnova-funded project that we are doing in collaboration with Örebro University and Friends. It aims to investigate and map social behaviour relating to bullying in schools, and to use technology and artificial intelligence to simulate situations using “digital twins” in order to be able to predict and prevent bullying. We currently have four developers from Tietoevry who are working on the project and are part of the project group’s tech team. I mainly work in JavaScript and frameworks like React, as well as with PHP, C# and sometimes in the AWS cloud environment. I am also currently learning about graph databases, which I didn’t have any experience with at all before I came to Tietoevry.”That should suit you perfectly given your previous life?“Definitely, with my background of working with children and young people, as well as mental health, it really appeals to me,” she agrees. “That doesn’t necessarily automatically make me a better developer, but of course, the natural interest is a strength that is hopefully reflected in the result, as a result of having a good understanding of the problem. This is common to everyone working in the project. I previously worked with helping people on an individual level, whereas this is on a national or structural level, which is extremely exciting.”How do you view your future and career development?“I have “a-ha” moments every day. If there is something I’ve learned in this short time, it’s that, in overall terms, I still know and can do relatively little. Learning something every day feels like a good goal for both my career and my future. I appreciate the daily conversations with colleagues and managers about small and big things. These are meaningful exchanges that no doubt motivate many people to go to work, combined with the desire to influence and to be part of the change.”Want to know more about the digital twin case?

That happened before he joined Tietoevry, and was a natural consequence of his interest in technology.“Programming can be about so many things, from basic control mechanisms to web development, design and modelling. Digitalisation is everywhere and programming is involved in most of the things around us today. I came to Tietoevry via an acquaintance, who was a manager at the former Tieto and thought my background and personality would suit Tietoevry’s mission, which was not easy to specifically define.”David enjoys the consulting profession, which is based very much on teamwork, coordination and communication.“I saw consultants as lone experts,” he explains, noting that there is a constant exchange of knowledge between interesting projects and fascinating access to extremely skilled people.You are leading a project called “The Digital Twin of Bullying”, can you tell us more about it please?“Yes, it’s a really interesting initiative. The aim is to reduce bullying and mental health problems among children in schools by using modern digital solutions, research and safety work. It is a Vinnova-financed project in which Tietoevry and Örebro University, in collaboration with Friends, will create a data-driven and automated way of combating bullying by using modern data collection, artificial intelligence and modelling technologies to generate a digital twin. Tietoevry’s role is to design, develop and test the digital tool. Örebro University is a world leader in research on bullying and harassment, and Friends does an incredible job with surveys and visits to schools. The term “twin” in this context comes from the medical world, where different models and behaviours are tested through simulation. This requires large amounts of data and knowledge about behaviours, patterns and social health in classrooms and schools. The end users of the “twin” are researchers, as well as headmasters and teachers. The idea is that everyone who works at and with schools should be able to use it. But that is still somewhat in the future. The timetable for the pilot is set for 2023.How will that be achieved?“As a first step, digital collection of data relating to children’s health data will be carried out, together with various evaluations. Visualisation of reality, i.e. the digital twin then acts as a copy of a situation, place or person, which is updated in real time. The aim is to make predictive analyses to create safe school environments, and that the project can contribute to defining a national standard for this type of measurement,” says David.What does Tietoevry have to offer as an employer?“I enjoy the area of overlap between technology and humanity, and think there are lots of reasons to work at Tietoevry – it provides a varied professional environment that allows for a large range of specialisations. Many of the employees have a technical background, others have a programming background and some come from a management background, and it certainly helps if you have a bit of an engineering mind as well,” David concludes.Want to know more about the digital twin case?

This could involve customer service telling us what customers say each day, or that we shadow a person to gain insight into how the service works in real life. This allows us to define a solution that fulfils a need.”Could you tell us about your current project?“I am working in a collaborative project, HSB Living Lab, which conducts research about the future of housing. The building, located in Gothenburg, has 16 occupants. It is good to work with research sometimes, because it entails completely different kinds of questions.

The project, which I run together with the Örebro County Administrative Board, is funded by PTS. We are doing it in collaboration with Fellingsbro Folk High School and people with intellectual disabilities. But we don’t do it just for them; 70,000 people a year suffer from an acquired brain injury that leads to impaired ability to understand numbers. We want to help them. It doesn’t actually require much stress for our ability to understand to be reduced, so comprehensible digital money benefits everyone.” What is the next step?“We have just completed the project report for PTS and are working on a minimum version of the service that we can launch. First as a beta version, so that we can gain further user insights, then with the goal of a wider launch during the year. Our original idea was to work with partners, preferably one or more banks, but this has been difficult to achieve. So, we had a rethink and are testing other approaches and solutions.”What do you get from it personally?“I think we all need to take responsibility. We have an ambition in Sweden to be really good at digitalisation, so we need to help each other with this. The opportunity to get deeply involved in projects that are beneficial to society is the reason why I still really enjoy working at Tietoevry after ten years here.”", Recruitment  Team ,Meet our people , 30.8.2022
The number of the risk: CEO – have you calibrated your security investments with your business risks?,/en/blog/2022/08/the-number-of-the-risk-ceo--have-you-calibrated-your-security-investments-with-your-business-risks/,Digitalization / Maria Nordgren / 24.8.2022,"The request may be driven by a need to gain peer respect with the latest gizmos. Or it may be driven by the need to upgrade an important piece in the overall security puzzle.Do you know which it is? Moreover, do you need to know how this request aligns with your business risks and the security needs they present?
Organizations, their operations, IT systems and ecosystems are increasing in complexity. And the pace of the changes driving this is accelerating. The end result is, cybersecurity today is so complex an entity that a multi-dimensional and holistic approach is required.
What you really need is to understand how you can best calibrate your security investments with your business, or operations, risks. In cybersecurity, as all other areas of investment, you get what you pay for. If you overestimate your risk levels, you will be investing in security until the cows come home. If you underestimate your security risks, your protection will be too light.
Think of you home; do you live in a hermetically sealed vault underground and drink only filtered water? Or do you leave for work with your windows open and your door held shut by a broom instead of a lock?
On the surface, the process is perhaps obvious. Map the security related organizational and business risks that you are facing. Evaluate those risks; how likely are they to materialize, and how big an impact do they have on your operations, short and long term.
Security investments need to have solid grounds and be optimized. No point or product based isolated solution over solution approaches, but right sized investments based on business risks.
Many smaller companies have very likely decided to postpone the regulatory upgrading of their systems. The reason is, if I am a small barber shop, what are the odds of me being raided by the privacy police?
“Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast” – the beast, in this case, being security investments. You, as the finance decision maker of your organization, need to have an understanding of these risk numbers. Have a full view, demand to have a full view, into your security risks. Understand them, balance them against your operations, and invest accordingly and wisely. Not too little, not too much.
As a first step, reach out to your CISO or CIO for a chat on this topic. As a second step, if you need further assistance from a trusted third party, reach out to me or anyone of my colleagues at Tietoevry.", Maria Nordgren ,Digitalization , 24.8.2022
How micromerchants are adapting to the cashless world,/en/blog/2022/08/how-micromerchants-are-adapting-to-the-cashless-world/,Digitalization / Anders Wahlbom / 12.8.2022,"Two years after the start of the pandemic, around seven in ten transactions across the continent are now executed without cash, according to the BIS[1]. Meanwhile, Europe has seen a corresponding and persistent drop in ATM usage, suggesting the switch to digital payments is here to stay. The UK’s Financial Times reports[2] ATM usage went down more than 40% during COVID – and has remained depressed since.The switch to a cashless society means whole new merchant categories want to accept electronic payments, including street vendors, charities and micro-businesses. In the past, such vendors resisted electronic payment because of perceived costs and complexity: however, they’re now going cashless to halt declining revenues. Recent research from PCM estimates[3] the number of merchants accepting electronic payments will rise by 30% between now and 2028. Examples include the Tiptap app launched in North America that targets charities looking to accept low-value donations via contactless cards, and the development of cashless acceptance networks for street food vendors in Asia, India and elsewhere.What it means for acquiring and acceptanceAs we explain in our new white paper, these new merchant categories will be looking for low-cost, easy-to-use payment systems that are flexible and offer best-in-class security. They want solutions that avoid the cost and complexity of purchasing and setting up a standalone payment terminal – as well as offering new dimensions in convenience, security and functionality.“Tap to Mobile” systems respond to these needs. Designed to work on a commercial off the shelf (COTS) mobile phone, “Tap to Mobile” turns the phone into a payment acceptance terminal. Market Research Futures predict[4] the “Tap to Mobile” market will reach $76.3 billion by the end of 2025, representing average growth of more than 23% each year over the next four years – a much faster growth rate than either e-commerce (17%) or standard POS terminals (9%).In our white paper “Next-generation cashless payments for new merchants and more”, we outline the simplicity of installation and set up in a “Tap to Mobile” system. The merchant downloads an app just like any other. They then register to an acquiring service provided by a bank or payment services provider (PSP) using independent device verification (IDV) techniques that confirm merchant identity and associate the merchant’s transactions with their device. Merchant bank details are also confirmed rapidly via an API call on their bank. The whole process takes hours to complete, rather than the usual days or weeks.These fast set-up routines plus the absence of a dedicated POS terminal make Tap to Mobile a revolutionary solution. Previously, many smaller merchants were put off accepting electronic payments by the cost and complexity of purchasing or renting a POS terminal, as well as long set-up and authentication processes. As Tap to Mobile only requires a standard smartphone, such systems are cheaper and easier to set up compared to previous-generation POS devices. Tap to Mobile also takes advantage of the phone screen for transactions requiring PIN confirmation – and can be readily adapted to accept new transaction types such as Account-to-Account (A2A) transactions, or Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL).Download a copy of our white paper to find out more about Tap to Mobile as the next-generation acceptance solution for new merchants.[1] See the Bank for International Settlements, 9 December 2021, “COVID-19 Accelerated Digital Payments”: https://www.bis.org/statistics/payment_stats/commentary2112.htm[2] See The Financial Times, 26 May 2020: “COVID-19 acclerates shift away from cash”: https://www.ft.com/content/430b8798-92e8-4b6a-946e-0cb49c24014a[3] See The Digital and Card Payment Yearbooks 2021-2022 at www.paymentyearbooks.com[4] See Payments Cards and Mobile, 26 January 2022, The digital revolution moves from payment to acceptance: https://www.paymentscardsandmobile.com/tap-on-mobile-the-digital-revolution-moves-from-payment-to-acceptance/", Anders Wahlbom ,Digitalization , 12.8.2022
Transforming from industrial automation to AI based autonomy: is Project Bonsai the right fit for you?,/en/blog/2022/08/transforming-from-industrial-automation-to-ai-based-autonomy-is-project-bonsai-the-right-fit-for-you/,Digitalization / Rory Moore / 2.8.2022,"In this article, you can learn about:Use cases where Project Bonsai has proven to be valuable
Industry examples of optimization opportunities
Key benefits delivered
How Tietoevry works with Project Bonsai
Examples of project deliveriesIntroduction: What is Project Bonsai?The move towards autonomous industrial systems is often seen as being both prohibitively complex and expensive for many manufacturers. While automation has been around for years – and is the proven ‘staple’ for controlling processes – the decisions and resulting actions will always be made based on a pre-defined set of rules. This means that continuous optimization can be challenging, especially if the process inputs and environment can be variable.Autonomous AI makes a world of a difference. It learns and can adapt to environmental changes and thus evolve as needed to ensure that optimization is always in focus. This ability to ‘learn’ results in the potential for huge optimization possibilities as it explores new ways to solve problems and prevent unwanted results. In other words, Autonomous AI can both optimize existing controls (and operator capabilities) and also hunt and explore for new ways for any given industrial process to be improved. It is this ability to hunt for new solutions that makes it so potentially invaluable in terms of cost savings, productivity, and human capital capability.The key difference between traditional AI technologies and Project Bonsai is that it is a complete toolchain and a platform for building Autonomous AI with a low code approach. This means that your systems and control experts are now able to create their own Bonsai Brains with just a little training, and without the need of Data Science expertise.Use-cases showcasing how you might benefit from Microsoft Project BonsaiIn order to ensure a high level of optimization success, the selection and definition of the use-case is critical. Below are just some examples of use-case characteristics where a Bonsai Brain can bring quick wins and measurable results.High level of human-operator dependency in processes
In any instance where the operator needs to change machine/process settings according to e.g., raw material feed, quality requirements or environmental changes, AI driven autonomous automation can have a significant impact. A Bonsai Brain can improve upon and complement the operator’s performance autonomously whilst also ensuring that you always have an excellent performance standard regardless of the skill level of the human operating/supervising the machine/process.





Simulation data available
The key advantage of a Bonsai Brain is that it simulates learning. This learning can unlock not only skilled operator-like performance but also the opportunity to exceed the performance of your best human capital. The more the Brain learns in Simulation, the better the end performance is when put into a production environment. So, if your machine/process can be simulated, then it is possible to apply a Bonsai Brain to enhance and compliment your optimization capabilities.





 Systems and processes where you have gained a lot of process knowledge
Human expert knowledge is invaluable in order to optimize. Much of this knowledge can be used to fast-track and accelerate the learning process for a Bonsai Brain, which in turn yields faster and more accurate results for you. Feeding the existing process expertise into the simulation environment ensures that the nuances of any given process and its parameters are understood and applied in the right way. It also means that this knowledge and capability will not remain only in the minds of your skilled and experienced personnel, but rather can be replicated and scaled across your processes.





 Processes and industrial applications, where optimization can bring significant savings potential
Across the Nordics, we have a long history of automation in multiple different industries. Many of these industries rely on optimization as a means of competitive advantage and meeting sustainability targets. Sometimes optimization benefits may result from optimizing one process step or machine, and at other times it is a complete end-to-end process optimization that yields the desired results.Industry examples of optimization opportunitiesPulp & paper industryIn-feed and out-feed optimization for Bulk Material Handling applications such as conveyor belts and screw drives
Digesters for pulp production
Wash Presses for pulp purificationPlastics applicationsDie extrusion processes
Plastics moulding
Vacuum formingMetalsSmelting furnaces
Chemical extraction and electrolysis processEnergy production and managementWind farm optimization

Hydro and turbine optimization
Load managementKey benefits of Microsoft Project BonsaiThe benefits of Project Bonsai are numerous and varied, but let’s focus on four key areas:Compliment your best-skilled Human OperatorsImagine a world in which all of your processes are operated by people with the same excellent skill level as your best operator. A Bonsai Brain on your machine/system can make that a reality. It is getting harder and harder to both train and retain highly skilled operators, especially those with many years of experience and expert knowledge. A Bonsai Brain can be an excellent complement to your workforce and can result in huge savings via autonomous AI optimization.New and innovative ways to optimizeAutonomous AI can hunt for new solutions to a problem by trying new and different approaches and solutions millions of times over. It can iterate solutions in simulation and learn based on a set of defined rewards. This means that it can discover better ways of solving a challenge over time and predict when to apply a different strategy according to a changing environment (raw material quality, temperature, pressure, etc). It is this ability that really makes this technology so invaluable and exciting.Low Code and designed for engineersProject Bonsai virtually eliminates the need for pure Data Science when using an AI based approach. It is low code, meaning that with a relatively small amount of training someone with good process and system expertise can design, build, simulate and implement a Bonsai Brain without having to rely solely on a team of data scientists. This also facilitates a large element of independence and self-sufficiency for you as an organization in terms of the rapid development of new capabilities.Reduce risk and accelerate the developmentBonsai learns in a simulation environment which in turn results in low risk. The brain can practice and learn safely without the need to deploy directly to a production environment. Only when the brain proves it can improve upon the old/current process can it be deployed accordingly. This also has the side-effect of dramatically reducing the lead-time for new AI use-case development and testing. Further to this, the brain can be designed to work both with your operators or also on its own, making it highly scalable.How do we work with Microsoft Project Bonsai?Tietoevry and Microsoft have a strategic collaboration with Project Bonsai. We are Microsoft’s partner of choice in Northern Europe for the delivery of AI-powered solutions for autonomous industrial control systems based on Microsoft’s Project Bonsai low-code Platform. The partnership will help the industry to capture the benefits of AI-driven automation.We have developed a simple and pedagogic process for fast-tracking your Bonsai project:Click image to enlargeWe place high importance on defining the business case and ROI before any Bonsai Brain design and development happens. Thereafter we focus on the Brain Design with our Bonsai experts and in tandem arrange for the training of your Subject Matter Experts.Simulation as expressed above is a crucial stage, and we take care to ensure that your simulation environment and data will fulfil the necessary criteria to guarantee the best possible Brain design and outcome.Project Bonsai Proof-PointsWhilst Bonsai is a new technology, it has proven itself successful in many cases. Some examples include:Chemical process optimization: Continuously stirred tank reactor – 74% Improvement
Food industry process optimization: PepsiCo extrusion optimization

The iT’s Tissue 2022 event was immensely useful – while revealing a business success gap,/en/blog/2022/07/the-its-tissue-2022-event-was-immensely-useful--while-revealing-a-business-success-gap/,Digitalization / Jarmo  Ropponen  / 13.7.2022,"More interestingly, perhaps, the event highlighted a business success issue yet to be solved – planting an extended Manufacturing Execution System (MES) with sales and operations planning between ERP and shop-floor automation.Lucca - the Tissue ValleyLucca, aside from its touristic attractiveness, is also home to one of the European tissue industry’s most important events, iT’s Tissue.The event, organized by the Tissue Italy network founded in 2012 by 12 Italian companies from the region’s “Tissue Valley”, promotes made-in-Italy technological excellence in the tissue industry and regularly brings together industry representatives from all over the world.Following earlier events in 2013, 2015, and 2018, iT’s Tissue 2022 saw more than 1,000 registered participants from 250 companies and 70 countries, a large part of them at the C-level.True to the theme of the event – intersection between technology and networking, with a focus on knowledge, experience, and continuous technological innovation – visitors were treated to the most recent developments in both tissue production and converting.Challenges throughout the supply chainBesides sustainability and technological innovation, as iT’s Tissue amply showcased, success in today’s highly competitive, fairly low-margin tissue industry requires accurate demand prediction and operational efficiency. Prediction should cover the entire supply chain from raw material sourcing to factory logistics and customer deliveries, while operational efficiency requires near real-time vision into BOM (Bill Of Material) against the ability to quickly change recipes for different end products as demand changes.Energy prices and inflation are putting pressure on the tissue industry. Not least because most tissue mills purchase their pulp from external sources and have no in-house energy generation capacity. Many operators also struggle with increased prices of recycled (RCP) fibre, and even the availability is scarce. Every bale of pulp must be processed for production at the lowest possible cost.Even though margins may be low, production volumes can produce big wins. After all, the rising standard of living in all major markets throughout the world means more demand for tissue. But this also means you need to be able to quickly react to demand while at the same time maintaining flexible production at sensible cost-to-serve figures.Profitability hinges on digitalizationTo cope with the situation profitably, you need to complement hardware excellence with capable software that will automatically assist in both demand prediction and shop-floor efficiency.What if:You could increase your competitiveness through efficient Sales & Operational Planning (S&OP) while having a real-time view on what is going on?

4 key trends that will impact your future Digital Workplace,/en/blog/2022/07/4-key-trends-that-will-impact-your-future-digital-workplace/,Cloud / Thomas Rasch Brastad / 8.7.2022,"Why? Well, for starters it is essential to increase employee engagement and productivity. You’ll find plenty of articles covering this subject (or call me and I’ll be happy to brief).I’d like to look further ahead. What’s coming next? What are the main trends that will affect the user needs in a modern digital workplace?By now most companies are maturing and adapting well to the “new normal”, adjusting for the hybrid workplace and finding new ways of collaborating digitally. To support this transformation, 75% of organisations plan to invest in their digital workplace1. So what do we need to take into consideration when investing? And what do companies need to prepare for?Increasing agility and autonomyThe last two year’s transformation towards more flexible and agile ways of working is just the beginning. Our employees are becoming more self-helped and autonomous. Business agility requires team empowerment and autonomy, rather than the traditional management steering. In fact, Gartner predicts that within two years 30% of our employees will work in teams without a direct manager2. And according to HBR research, 65% of current management tasks have the potential to be automated3. These managerial tasks can be automated away, creating space for managers to focus more on valuable actions to attract and retain their employees.This means that your digital workplace needs to support the shift from central decision making toward network-based way of working. For example integrating HR processes and trivial management tasks in our employee’s digital workplace, enabling faster decisions and reducing bottlenecks in a hybrid working environment.Impact of the Gig EconomyEmployee turnover will continue to increase as hybrid and remote work become the norm for knowledge workers. This adds to the already increasing Gig Economy. A large number of employees work several part-time jobs, or as an independent freelancer juggling assignments. In the US, more than 35% already work gig jobs, and this is expected to double within the next 2-5 years. This may provide companies with more hiring flexibility going forward, but the overshadowing concern is the hardened competition for talent.How then, can the digital workplace meet the needs of a growing Gig Economy? Employers who want to attract the best talent will need to put the end user at the focus of their strategy. Flexibility around where, when and on what device people can work is no longer a differentiator, it is expected! The key going forward will not just be a digital workplace that is constantly modernized and improved. But also making sure that the end user is aware of the direct and positive impact of these improvements.A holistic Multi-ExperienceFocusing on the End User Experience is a key factor to succeed with a modern digital workplace. Measuring the service performance and the overall employee experience enables us to proactively work on improvements and increase productivity. However, great employee experience is just the first step. Imagine the powerful effect if you manage to directly connect your people’s daily work to the customer value. Connecting the user experience for our employees with the user experience for end customers, brings a whole new level of meaningful workplace to our employees.For example, enabling customer support personnel to solve issues more proactively has a positive impact on their user experience and performance. If you also tie this to the overall effect it has on less workload, improved customer experience, and customer value, you will connect our employees to the bigger picture. Aiming towards a holistic multi-experience, will not only bring more awareness, but also a sense of higher purpose to our work and services delivered.The impact of sustainability goalsThere is no modern digital workplace without focus on sustainability. Thankfully, I see our customers and partners increasingly weighting sustainability more in requirements and expectations. In a digital workplace, it needs to be implemented in every step of the delivery chain. For example, tracking the level of reusage, recycling or sustainable decommissioning of your PC’s and devices.Going forward, such targets will be more centrally managed. Making it easier to calculate the total cost of environmental impact, both short and long term. What impact, for instance, will increased workplace flexibility and digital collaboration have on our employees travelling? What difference will it make to keep a mobile phone for three or four years, instead of two? Calculating and visualizing the impact of these choices on an individual basis, not only brings awareness to our employees, but also empower each one of us to make conscious choices and proudly contribute to a better future.A final piece of advice: No matter what you choose to focus on in your workplace transformation, your first priority should be to get the necessary insights. Three basic steps:Implement capabilities to measure and analyze the impact of your workplace investments.



Set a baseline and clear targets for productivity, user experience, sustainability and talent retention. Or other goals relevant for your business strategy.



Measure and analyze the development, and adjust your course when needed.It’s the only way to know if you are on the right track, and stay ahead in game.

We are committed to driving three main research topics in the project: real-time bill payment, financial insights, and real-time financial crime prevention. The common nominators are real-time services and extensive utilization of data.Modernizing the e-invoice infrastructure with real-time bill paymentThe aim of the ecosystem model for bill payment is to make the invoice and payment flows completely transparent to the companies, whereas now a company normally learns about the status of the invoice on payment due date + 1 time by the bank providing bank statement. The whole invoicing process will be fully real-time, just like in mobile payments already today, with a dashboard showing all the stages from delivering the invoice to the payment.The ecosystem aims to comprise banks, financing companies together with large billers like retail groups and insurance companies, in addition to fintech companies with new innovations and services. We have a good set of participants interested in the initiative, but there are still some missing parts. In the Veturi sub project we will identify the gaps and define the operating model for roles needed in the value chain. The introduction of real-time payment will have a huge societal impact on the reduction of manual work when debt collection due to human errors, like forgetting to pay, can be avoided.Using aggregated data for better and sustainable decision makingIn the Financial insights sub project, we will be aggregating financial data into a datalake which is utilized for sustainable decision making. At the moment, we are creating POV (proof of value) for credit area solutions, eg. AI-driven portfolio analysis and machine learning profit scoring models. These are done already in a smaller ecosystem and the first use cases are focusing on managing the risks in consumer loans. We will continue the project with company loans processes and expanding later to company liquidity management forecasting.Preventing financial crimes with the help of machine learning and AIIn this sub project, starting in 2023, we will leverage extensively machine learning, AI and data on financial services for the prevention of fraudulent transactions, anti-money laundering and other automated processes for financial disputes. All the data gathered from sources throughout the fraud prevention value chain is efficiently converted to intelligence with help from our integrated ML functionality and though the analytics dashboard.We are constantly looking for active participants to our ecosystem, so if you are interested, please contact Sami Uski or Mikko Erkkilä.", Sami  Uski ,Digitalization , 7.7.2022
Tap into the power of mobile devices,/en/blog/2022/07/tap-into-the-power-of-mobile-devices/,Digitalization / Anders Wahlbom / 5.7.2022,"The huge rise in merchants turning to electronic payments has been driven by a long-term decline in cash use, accelerated by the pandemic. The addition of these merchants, typically smaller and medium-sized enterprises, could see the number of companies accepting electronic payments soar by 30% in less than a decade. At the same time, more consumers have turned to electronic payments given hygiene concerns and the speed and convenience of paying with cards or digital wallets.In our new white paper, Tap to Mobile: Next-generation cashless payments for new merchants , we argue that most first-time adopters of electronic payments will seek to turn their mobile devices into payment terminals via apps that are fast and simple to install. Known as “Tap to Mobile”, this method of acceptance is predicted[1] to reach a total market value of $76.3 billion by the end of 2025, representing growth of over 23% each year.Previously, many smaller merchants were put off accepting electronic payments by the cost and complexity of purchasing or renting a POS terminal, as well as long set-up and authentication processes. As Tap to Mobile only requires a standard smartphone, such systems are cheaper and easier to set up compared to previous-generation POS devices.The ease of onboarding merchants using Tap to Mobile means they do not experience loss of revenue while waiting days or weeks for authentication and set-up to complete. Because Tap to Mobile systems can be set up “over the air” (that, is remotely via wireless internet communication) and without reference to a Terminal Service Provider, they can be updated and adapted to accept new payments methods such as Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL), account-to-account (A2A) solutions and crypto payments, all of which are destined to play a much bigger role in Europe’s payments landscape in the years ahead.For more than two years, Tietoevry has been developing and piloting a Tap to Mobile solution in partnership with leading technology companies. This solution is white-label, meaning it can be branded with an acquirer or PSP’s logo and adapted to suit their requirements. This solution will be of great interest to acquirers and PSPs looking to target both the existing and emerging new merchant populations, especially SME merchants, small chains and merchants looking to combine their online and physical acquiring into one solution.As one of Europe’s leading transaction processors with fully-secure 24/7/365 availability, we are connected to a wide range of acquirers. Our systems have processed two billion transactions each year over the last 15 years, with consistent 100% availability in our core. This level of expertise enables us to offer banks and PSPs the ability to acquire transactions using our Tap to Mobile solution and process those transactions using our secure, always-on technologies.Download our new white paper to find out more about why and how “Tap to Mobile” solutions will deliver a step change in payments acceptance.[1] Payments Cards and Mobile, 26 January 2022, The digital revolution moves from payment to acceptance: https://www.paymentscardsandmobile.com/tap-on-mobile-the-digital-revolution-moves-from-payment-to-acceptance/", Anders Wahlbom ,Digitalization , 5.7.2022
Optimising the loan origination process - important aspects,/en/blog/2022/07/optimising-the-loan-origination-process-important-aspects/,Digitalization / Lars Gaustad / 4.7.2022,"BackgroundThe loan origination process includes risk assessments, a decision, offering a competitive price, assessment, and setup of the correct and necessary collateral, then loan and credit production. The final step is payments to the recipient, as specified in the loan agreement. Each step must be consistent with the bank’s business policy and current rules and legislation.The loan origination process is traditionally a complex manual process which is executed by different specialists in the banks, using a wide range of tools and procedures to process loan applications and produce the different loan and credit products.Core factorsThe ability to reach customers and provide the necessary service and guidance affects the volume of new credit. The quality of risk assessments and the decision-making process affects profitability, as well as future losses. Setting the appropriate price level optimizes a bank’s net interest income.Loan Origination SystemsStreamlining banks’ operations, increasing their efficiency, and improving the quality of the process and credit decisions has involved an evolution from manual rule-based processes to increasingly system-based support, binding the whole process together. It starts with fetching the application from different sources, guiding and documenting the origination process, production of relevant documents, then credit product production. The processing of payments in accordance with the loan agreement is also included in Loan Origination Systems (LOS).Tietoevry has more than 25 years of experience with development and delivery of LOS in the Nordics. During this time, we have closely monitored developments, changes, and all new opportunities within this area and we have developed great experience in such solutions.ChallengesAlthough extensive system support is already in place, there is a continuous need for change and improvement, due to constantly changing rules and legislation. For example, the European Banking Authority has been working since 2011 to establish harmonized regulation across the EU to increase financial stability.Opportunities for digitalization are increasing day by day. One important example is how BankID simplifies and automates the authentication and digital signature process in Norway, with its legally-binding status. Other examples are access to property registers, digital access to tax reports and salary information. Each country’s digital infrastructure and the level of digitalization possible varies.Customer expectations regarding the way they interact with banks are changing, and banks need to interact with them using the interfaces they prefer. This includes mobile devices, PCs and in-person contact.The loan origination process is critical to both the banks’ income and costs, making it crucial for banks to implement improvements and changes associated with new technology, regulatory changes and customer expectations.How can banks manage this ever-changing landscape to retain and improve their competitiveness?It is our experience that the key success factors are a clear strategy and guidance for direction, prioritizations which are aligned with the bank’s strategy, and choosing the best, long-lasting technology.Which areas should receive highest priority?It is Tietoevry’s experience as a provider of LOS to around 100 banks in Norway and Sweden during the past 25 years that there are three areas in particular which need to be prioritised. These three areas all impact on banks’ competitiveness.The first is implementation of the highest possible degree of digitalization in the loan origination process, then exploiting this to automate and improve process efficiency, offering a better user experience and improving process quality, thereby reducing the bank’s risk. A key factor is observing developments in new digital infrastructure and adopting them. Tietoevry is part of the cooperation between the public and private sector for infrastructure development and standardization, and is monitoring the growing opportunities in the Nordic region.The second area is changes in compliance requirements. These rules and legislation should be integrated into the Loan Origination System, so that banks no longer use manual procedures. This will increase the banks’ efficiency and guarantee a high level of compliance with the statutory rules and legislation.The third area is to offer solutions which meet customer expectations, resulting in high customer satisfaction and a good reputation for the bank. Customers expect to be able to interact via their preferred channels, using tools that are user-friendly and easy to understand, and many customers continue to need support from bank advisors.Positioning strategies to prioritise competitiveness measuresTechnology decisionsLOS software providers need to handle every part of the process. Success here requires deep competence in many areas. When this competence organisation is in place, it must target development in the areas which optimise business value. These resources should not have to struggle with technical issues associated with desupported software. Such tasks cannot be completely avoided, but decision-making processes regarding technology should focus on choosing technology that is likely to have a long life. The objective of the risk assessments should be to select long-lasting technology and standards. In the long run, it is wise to avoid special tools and software from single vendors, even if they offer attractive features, and to choose standardized tools which are not dependent on specific providers.Flexible architectureWhen possible and appropriate, parts of the solutions can and should be designed as separate modules that can also be implemented in other areas than originally intended. To achieve this, architecture governance and transparency around architectural choices are critical.Being prepared for major development and improvementsLOS providers must always strive to have the right competence on the building blocks of LOS. This includes deep technical knowledge, an understanding of the architecture, an understanding of the business the software is intended to manage and always looking for opportunities for development with the potential to increase the competitiveness of the banks that use LOS.Avoid development that does not increase competitivenessFinally, to maintain capacity for development which leads to substantial improvement of LOS, it is important to avoid minor development work which does not increase the competitiveness of the banks which use LOS.Excellent opportunities for the futureTietoevry has embarked on the journey to maximize use of all existing LOS software and is reshaping such into flexible modules which will represent the next-generation LOS. This architecture will offer enhanced flexibility for future change, and it will protect and utilize all the investment that is built into the current version of the LOS, resulting in new and improved capabilities.Eager to learn more?

Data lakes and warehouses part 4: Challenges,/en/blog/2022/07/data-lakes-and-warehouses-challenges/,Data / Timo Aho / 2.7.2022,"This is the blog series:Data lakes and warehouses part 1: Intro to paradigmsData lakes and warehouses part 2: Databricks and SnowflakeData lakes and warehouses part 3: Azure Synapse point of viewData lakes and warehouses part 4: ChallengesThen, let's go to the challenges.They can be divided into three distinct categories:Challenges related to tools that are third-party cloud applications, not created by the cloud provider like Microsoft or Amazon.
Issues typical for the paradigm.
Tool specific features.Let me tackle the first two in this blog post. I will use Databricks, Snowflake and Azure Synapse components as examples. In future posts, I will present some solutions for the challenges.ScenarioI need to highlight that even if the discussion is generalizable, most of my and my colleagues’ experience is related to Microsoft Azure cloud environment.To add up, we work in DevOps and continuous delivery type projects. We always have a common version control like Git and code review practices. We also have multiple identical infrastructure environments that are typically configured with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform. Moreover, we target continuous deployments to production.Consequently, graphical user interface tools do not fit into the approach very well. At least, we should be able to export the configuration to a readable format like JSON. For instance, Azure Data Factory supports this.Third-party cloud application: Network and permissionsThe first category is about the challenges related to third-party solutions. From the introduced technologies, this covers evenly both Databricks and Snowflake.Synapse framework, on the other hand, is developed by Azure cloud provider Microsoft. Thus, in this category its position is stronger even if some questions are nontrivial.Let’s start with security. We usually minimize data movement outside the customer’s own cloud environment. That is, we avoid taking data from the cloud provider network to public internet. Cloud providers have tools such as virtual networks and firewalls for this.Very often the third-party tools run in a separate Azure environment: either in their own account or at least in a separate network architecture. The network configuration is usually more limited compared to native solutions so we might be able to configure secure access for web browser usage but not for the background engine. Sometimes third-party tools even need to be available for public internet connections. This was originally the case for both example technologies, but things are a lot better nowadays.Another question is authentication and authorization. In Azure native services, we have a standardized way of working. We can use Azure Active Directory (AAD) users, groups, and role-based access control (RBAC). We can usually synchronize our groups to third-party tools, but the permission model is typically different and must be configured separately.As explained in the previous posts, the problem might not be as serious for data lake tools due to their simpler permission model. However, data warehouse tools have significantly more granular permission control.Associated questions relate to getting out logs, error messages and alerts from these tools. We usually need to make some additional configuration to do this.Paradigm – Apache Spark and data lakeIn a typical data lake scenario, the major component is based on Apache Spark - a distributed computation framework. This is the case for tools such as Databricks and Synapse Spark pool. Let us make it clear: Apache Spark is not a simple tool to use.I will describe the issue with an example. Assume that we have an optimized terabyte level data set <data 1>, which has information about names, ages, and countries of residence.A typical simple Spark code could include the following phases:Read the data set <data 1>
Print the number of rows in <data 1>
Sort <data 1> according to age and store the result to data set <data 2>
Take only European people from <data 2>
Print the first ten rows of the <data 2>The code looks harmless. We could assume that lines 3 and 4, sorting and filtering, would take most resources to compute. However, instead line 2, printing the number of rows, might be the biggest issue; it may fill the computer memory or just freeze computation.Spark is a lazy framework and tries to postpone processing if possible. Spark might notice that only the ten oldest European people are needed on line 5. Thus, it is enough to find the persons and skip most of the sorting and storage data reading. Nevertheless, printing the row amount on line 2 might force reading all storage data.On the other hand, if the data in storage were distributed in another fashion, we could end up with the opposite situation. Counting rows might be immediate, and everything else is slow. We need to understand both the Spark framework and the way data is organized in storage.Paradigm – SQL and data warehousesIn data warehousing, data is almost exclusively processed with SQL language. Its compatibility with the DevOps scenario is, thus, a critical issue. This covers not only data warehouse products like Snowflake and Synapse Dedicated SQL pool, but also, to some extent, SQL based data lake tools like Synapse Serverless SQL pool.SQL is a declarative query language. Other typically used languages are either imperative or functional. Illustrating the significance needs a bit of effort so bear with me.With functional and imperative languages, a typical data processing workflow is:Read data from storage file <file 1>.
Do modifications to the data.
Store the result data to a file <file 2>.
Later, use data in <file 2>.Assume we noticed a mistake in the modification code on line 2. We repair the code, re-run the workflow, and replace data <file 2> with repaired one. For future development, we store the source data <file 1> and the latest code version.Nevertheless, SQL language processes the data by either inserting new data, altering values, or deleting in-place. Thus, a typical SQL workflow is:Do modifications to the data in <data table 1>.
Later, use data in <data table 1>.Again, let us repair a hypothetical bug on line 1. We need to revert the changes done to <data table 1> and execute the repaired code for it. In practice, we need to re-read the original source data and execute the full processing history for it. We hope we have the processing history stored somewhere. In addition, we hope nobody bypassed the process by making some manual changes or so – most likely a false hope.To make things even worse, we typically have multiple modules that depend on each other. For example, we might store data warehouse modification code, data mart code and permission management code in different repositories. Interdependency graph information is rarely stored, and we need to painfully re-execute everything manually in guessed order.The same situation appears if we want to create one more identical infrastructure environment for, say, testing purposes.To be precise, we can use the functional/imperative style workflow for SQL development by, e.g., having multiple table versions. This is cumbersome and rarely done. Moreover, databases might also support writing non-SQL code with components like stored procedures. However, they are not meant to replace SQL but to add some more functionality on top of it.ConclusionsWe have gone through some major challenges that are common for third-party cloud tools, data lake solutions and data warehouse products in a continuously deployed development environment.In Azure cloud, third-party tools such as Databricks and Snowflake typically have challenges with configuration of, for instance, network infrastructure, permissions, log collecting and alerts. On the other hand, Azure Synapse framework has strengths in this case.Many data lake paradigm solutions are at least partially based on a major data lake processing environment Apache Spark. As explained, it is a challenging framework. Efficient optimization needs deep understanding of the framework and the way data is stored.On the other hand, data warehouses are almost exclusively based on SQL querying language. SQL language data modification workflow is problematic from the continuous deployment point of view. It concentrates on altering data in-place which makes processing lineage complex. Repairing bugs and creating new environments needs significantly more effort than with alternative approaches.In future posts we will hopefully get some ideas on how to solve the issues. Moreover, we might be able to dig a bit deeper into the more product specific questions.", Timo Aho ,Data , 2.7.2022
API management – a key to effective banking services,/en/blog/2022/07/api-management-a-key-to-effective-banking-services/,Data / Anders Flatås / 1.7.2022,"We are also witnessing companies basing their entire business model on this concept by consuming services from these providers.Uber’s solution uses APIs from mapping, communications, and billing providers with their own UX on top. This is based on the school of thought that it is easier to launch new services which do not need to be built from scratch.Travel aggregator sites use third-party APIs to display the best airline and hotel deals. Not only do they present deals, but these deals can be booked and future recommendations can be provided - all from the same website.Streaming services like Spotify and Netflix use APIs to distribute content. Car manufacturers like Tesla send software updates directly to vehicles via APIs.So how are Nordic banks stacking up against these API industry innovators?There is little evidence that open banking APIs have had a significant impact on bank revenue. Use of PSD2 APIs is increasing and PSD2 has probably been a catalyst in this area. Yet again, we see an example of Amara’s Law: ‘We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.’Tietoevry has a long history of providing services to a long list of banks in the Nordic market, particularly core, payment and channel solutions. In a model where the banks have achieved cost sharing through partnership with Tietoevry and other banks, this has been a useful strategy for a service which some primarily consider to be a commodity.There has been an increased focus on the role of traditional banks in the digital age. Rules and legislation, changing customer expectations, rapid advancements in technology, and new competitors are forcing traditional banks to rethink the way they operate. Tietoevry wants to embark on that journey with our customers and their partners.We recognize that banks differ from each other and desire varying levels of differentiation and flexibility. Some smaller banks may be happy with standard channel products, while others have identified competitive advantages that lead them to expect more tailoring of their digital output.Tietoevry is convinced that APIs will be essential building blocks, as banks look for new ways of distributing their services in search of further growth. However, offering banks and their partners superior APIs will only take them part of the way. Structure, process and ease of use and access are needed to make this model truly work; step forward, API management.API management may be summarized as the process of designing, publishing, documenting, and analysing APIs in a secure environment. API management solutions guarantee that the public and internal APIs created by organisations are consumable and secure.Integration efforts can easily become messy, cancelling out the potential benefits of adopting APIs, unless there is a robust platform for managing APIs.API platforms help manage APIs at scale. They are useful for abstracting the many administrative pain points associated with integrating APIs and help increase the visibility and performance of APIs and ensure smooth and secure consumption.A good API management platform offers centralized governance of your APIs, and you can understand their evolving requirements and enhance their security.If you have a complete and organised view of your APIs, you can monitor their use more quickly and respond to any integration challenges.The key capabilities of an API management platform are:The API gateway serves as a single point of entry for all third-party clients, as well as playing an important role in securing API connectionsThe developer portal provides a hub for developers to access and share API documentation.API lifecycle management provides a system for building, testing, onboarding, and managing APIs while safeguarding version control.Analytics capabilities offer business owners and administrators insight into the volume of traffic to APIs, what drives that traffic, and the performance level.API monetization allows API providers to package, price, and publish their APIs, so that partners and developers can purchase access or participate in revenue sharing.Tietoevry is confident that API Management and API Marketplace are strategic bets that will realise major value for banks and financial institutions in the years ahead.Banks and their partners expect to be able to draw on a wide range of banking-related APIs, and to do so from a platform that is secure, easy to use and capable of monetization.Eager to learn more?

Optimise your IT operations with AIOps,/en/blog/2021/12/optimise-your-it-operations-with-aiops/,NextGen Enterprise / Debanjan Dey / 29.6.2022,"Today, IT organisations operate very complex and extensive environments, often a combination of private and public clouds and on-premises legacy setup. IT leaders, managers and teams are under great pressure to serve the business and orchestrate end-to-end IT operations and services across the infrastructure and application landscape.The key focus for organisations is to avoid any major incidents and any downtime. Organisations want high availability and performance of their critical applications. They are also looking for a highly automated setup that leverages data in a manner that makes it easier to make useful decisions for faster new capability development.However, the scattered IT environment makes it difficult to gain end-to-end visibility for all data points, make strategic decisions and manage the cost of IT operations.Data silos and manual processes causing great problemsThe challenge is connected to the growing number of data silos in modern enterprises. Data silos mean multiple data systems generating high volumes of their own data into a closed environment. As a result, special teams need to monitor separate systems and keep track of a constant flood of various tickets, events and alerts concerning the IT infrastructure, networks and applications.For many organisations, the major challenge is the reactive and manual way of working. It takes time to actually detect the issue, work on it, understand it, and then resolve it. Consequently, IT teams are occupied with daily operations with no time to focus on new capabilities.Need for speed and intelligence in automationThe situation calls for a smart solution. For Tietoevry’s managed services customers, it is available immediately: integrated AIOps as a turnkey platform.In the acronym, AI refers to artificial intelligence. Powered by tools typical in AI and machine learning, such as pattern matching, AIOps ingests, correlates, suppresses and enriches all data from different sources. It eliminates false positives and eliminates duplicates. For IT operations, all this enables focusing on relevant issues.An integrated AIOps platform brings all application and infrastructure operations into one single management portal and dashboard view. The alert noise and the mean time to detect and to respond is greatly reduced, which is a great operational benefit. It is easy to accelerate the incident resolution process and deliver actionable and predictive insight.The AIOps platform will also tell which applications should be modernised as a priority, and how the cloud journey can be accelerated.Significant financial and operational benefits grow over timeThe target of AIOps is to have 90% of the operative work done automatically by machines while human intervention is needed just for the remaining 10%. So far, the results among Nordic customers have been tremendous.We have seen cost savings ranging between 15% to 35%. In terms of productivity improvements, the range is 35% to 45%. The results depend on the scale, size, and complexity of the customer and whether only infrastructure or both infrastructure and applications are in the scope.AIOps is a hybrid IT monitoring and management platform that is a self-healing, zero-touch solution. One could say that it is a one-stop shop for all IT operations requirements. However, one must understand that AIOps is no magic bullet for all IT Operations Management (ITOM) issues. The benefits in terms of predictive recommendations and anomaly detection will grow over time since the more data the platform gets, the more it matures, and then generates more use cases and gives more operational efficiency.By providing better data, an enterprise using AIOps can make its business decisions much better all across the board. At the moment, these more data-driven decisions are a difficult benefit to quantify, but this intelligence part of AIOps will definitely play a key role going forward.5 AIOps benefits in a nutshell:No IT downtime
One dashboard view for all IT infrastructure and application operations
Significant reduction of manual work and IT operating costs over time
Faster detection and response to alerts, tickets and notifications
Predictive insights for data-driven decision makingChanging the operating model is slow, but implementing AIOps is fastIt is estimated that AIOps will become widely adopted and mainstream. It’s useful for all organisations that want to modernise to a digital platform that uses the latest and greatest technology of automation, analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Despite the benefits, the adoption may take time in a similar fashion than the cloud. When implementing AIOps, the greatest change is required of the people and organisation.Organisations need to change their IT operating model and start working differently. It is common that this type of transformation is slow, but it can be accelerated with the help of a trusted partner like Tietoevry.Depending on the customer size, the implementation is a short project which runs from two and a half to three and a half months. AIOps can be implemented as a standalone service or as part of a larger entity such as the Next-Gen Enterprise Services or infrastructure outsourcing.", Debanjan Dey ,NextGen Enterprise , 29.6.2022
Friction isn’t bad,/en/blog/2022/06/friction-isnt-bad/,Sustainability / Henning Starholm Steen / 29.6.2022,"This quote by PT Barnum in the movie “The Greatest Showman”, which is an awesome movie by the way, kinda says it all. Another quote I want to hit you with before we dive into this is from General George S. Patton. Besides being a bit of a hardass and a “man of his time” with lots of controversial opinions, he did have a very good perspective on cognitive diversity. He said;“If everyone is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.”Wait, what now - diversity you say? Okay, let me start from the beginning. Humans have, by nature, a fear of the unknown. We are usually suspicious, and sceptic of anything new, or strange to us. Things that don’t look “normal”, objects that are not “normal”, situations that are not “normal”, and then the point of this blogpost; Humans who we consider not to be “normal”. But I want you, who are reading this, to ask yourself; Do you consider yourself normal?Let us get academic here for a second and see how the Dictionary of Oxford Languages defines normal; as “conforming to a standard; usual, typical, or expected.”Now answer me this; How on earth would we get anything done if everyone did or thought what was standard, usual, typical, or expected?I mean, we would still be dragging ourselves and our stuff around on the ground not understanding anything about the concept of wheels, since everyone was “normal” and did, said and thought exactly the same. What then would be needed was that impatient cave-dweller who at some point snapped, dropped his stuff to the ground and yelled out loud: “There has got to be a different way!"".Did you know that scientists for a loooong time have tried to search for the genetic completely “normal” human? They did it in order to make a reference genom. But hey, guess what? They had to give up! The smartest guys and girls among us had to realize that no humans on Earth are 100% normal.So here goes: Normal doesn't exist. No one is normal. We are all human variations on a long series of the different axis. Especially on the cognitive one. The thing is, when we hear the word diversity, we often relate it with age, race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disabilities, culture, neurodiversity like autism and ADHD (which I advocate for) and so on. But.. let’s try and elevate the discussion beyond the labels, beyond the “categories”. Let’s talk about cognitive diversity.Very short, cognitive diversity is the inclusion of people who have different styles of problem-solving and can offer unique perspectives because they think differently. And this just doesn’t apply to autism, ADHD and other neurological conditions with their own strengths. This goes for literally everyone. Because these perspectives are shaped by WHO you are, not WHAT you are.You as a person, a citizen of the planet Earth, are a sum of all your experiences throughout your life. The positive, the negative, and even the traumatic experiences in your life can be turned into a skill or strength that can be utilized in a constructive way. Your brain is as unique as your fingerprint as it has been shaped by your life. So please use it.As some of you may or may not know, at Tietoevry we are on a genuine mission to change the world to the better. To create purposeful technology for the good of society. In order to do that, we need to be the society. We need to reflect every facet, every layer, every aspect of the world we live in today. To do that we need brains. We need various kinds of brains. We need your brain, her brain, his brain, their brain – heck, even my brain for some strange reason. Because we need friction.I mean, we all want everything in our life to go smooth or frictionless. In 95% percent of all contexts, friction might be a negative thing. But not in all contexts...You see, the world needs friction - because friction is not the same as conflict. Conflict is confrontational, aggressive and destructive. But friction is not meant to be malicious or ill-intended. Friction creates new perspectives. Friction creates value for ourselves and for society. Friction will help the world move forward. To do good.And that, ladies and gentlemen, and those of you not identifying with either is why we need cognitive diversity. Now go make some friction in the world. Have your voice and opinion heard, not for WHAT you are but for WHO you are? And to all you people who are in fact not normal at all; Don’t stay where you are merely tolerated, go where you are celebrated.", Henning Starholm Steen ,Sustainability , 29.6.2022
"AIOps: low risk, high reward. But it’s no magic bullet.",/en/blog/2021/01/aiops-low-risk-high-reward.-but-its-no-magic-bullet/,Data / Himadri Das / 29.6.2022,"There are upsides and downsides to IT automation. On the one hand, it promises efficiency gains, cost savings, reduced risk of errors and enhanced user satisfaction. The flipside of the coin is that without discipline and commitment it can make your situation worse rather than better.The first step should always be to put together a game plan to attack either the low-hanging fruit – identifying the manual processes to automate first, getting approval, and pushing delivery – or the processes with the potential for the highest business impact. The upside with the latter approach is that it may have better mid to long-term business case justification and high returns; the downside is that it might involve a long and complex implementation cycle. Whichever approach you choose, the good news is that the risk of failure in AIOps is minimal because it’s passed on to the partner or vendor.The AIOps maturity spectrumBusinesses can be roughly divided into three categories when it comes to their maturity:First-generation outsourcers, typically small or medium-sized enterprises, are risk-averse non-tech-savvy beginners. They have no experience of outsourcing and they lack maturity and automation know-how.
Second-generation outsourcers already have some AI capabilities and understand the basics, but don’t have a full stack of AIOps.
Advanced, third-generation outsourcers are veterans with perhaps 10–15 years of AI experience under their belts. While they might want to implement AI more widely, they’re shackled by the tug of war between business and IT priorities.Myth-busting in the new-normal worldThe COVID-19 pandemic has busted many a myth, including that service delivery only really succeeds when people are working in an office; home workers have proved themselves more than able to do their jobs properly without major disruption to services.AIOps is not a tool, but a holistic approach to building automation that requires businesses to put in the hard work and develop solid use cases. Businesses want to see the real impact of automation on both their support function and their business operations ­– and they want to see real use cases.And when businesses break silos – for example, by implementing full-stack automation aligned with their business KPIs rather than focusing on a specific workflow or process ­– they can enhance the positive impact of automation initiatives even further. With AIOps the real trick is to take baby steps, implementing capabilities gradually based on requirements before taking things further to improve other processes.AIOps is not a magic bulletLet’s bust another myth held true by many professionals: that AI and automation will magically solve all their problems. Without careful implementation and solid use cases supported by a detailed rollout plan, businesses will quite simply waste time, money, and resources.The first step should always be to align the capabilities of AI with your business requirements. Take things at your own pace and increase your maturity gradually; look for the low-hanging fruit and automate other processes as you move forward and become more confident and capable. With process improvement, don’t try to do everything in-house if you don’t have the capabilities. Outsourcing is not a sin – done right, it improves your chances of success and shifts the risk of failure onto the service provider.Recommended further reading:Blog: Boost IT operations with artificial intelligence – this is what AIOps is all aboutLesson Learned From an Interview: AIOps Is Not Just About ToolsResearch By: Mahmoud Ramin, Info-Tech Research Group, October 26, 2020", Himadri Das ,Data , 29.6.2022

Modern payments use too much energy. Here’s how we can do better.,/en/blog/2022/06/modern-payments-use-too-much-energy-heres-how-we-can-do-better/,Sustainability / Hans Sjölund / 24.6.2022,"The payments industry has not been immune, especially the crypto and blockchain segment which, some claim, uses as much energy as a small country for mining and transaction purposes. Even without crypto, there is a wide range of ways in which the payments sector can raise its game when it comes to environmental responsibility and sustainability.With consultants and NGOs reporting[1] three-quarters of European consumers expect their banking services provider to take action on climate change, our recent white paper on sustainable card payments makes the case for why the payments business needs to reduce its environmental impact – and sets out practical steps for how to make this happen.Sustainable card payments: our responsibility  outlines the actions our industry should take to reduce its environmental impact, including issuing sustainable cards manufactured from earth-friendly sources such as corn, ocean recovered plastic and recycled PVC or PET. In the card management space, we make the case for using recycled paper and reducing the use of paper in general in client communications and minimizing the carbon footprint of the card production and delivery process.“By implementing the measures we recommend in this white paper, we’ve reduced our total environmental impact by 56% since 2016.”At Tietoevry Banking, we estimate that around 10% of energy use in the card business[2] comes from processing operations. To reduce the impact of this energy use, we undertake card processing using 100% renewable energy sources at our data centres in Norway. We also believe customers should be given the option to recycle their cards at end of life – that’s why we’ve entered into a partnership with SpareBank1[3] to find ways to manage card recycling in a sustainable manner. Measures such as these have helped us to reduce Tietoevry’s total environmental impact by 56% since 2016.Acting on sustainability is the right thing to do. However, many studies also show it’s great for your business: recently, the Harvard Business Review revealed[4] 65% of consumers are seeking brands driven by the sustainability agenda, while in October 2020 Nielsen Research claimed[5] 81% of the world’s consumers expect companies to take action to save the planet.By improving the sustainability of your card programmes, you establish your institution with customers as a leader in environmental protection and enhance customer loyalty by making your customers feel good about using your cards. Such positive sentiments aren’t just limited to customers, either: our experience suggests that colleagues in banks with sustainable approaches feel better about their work. It all adds up to a situation in which your work to help the planet can also drive measurable returns for your business.Download a copy of the recent white paper on sustainable card payments from Tietoevry Banking now to learn more about steps to reduce the environmental impact of your card programmes.[1] See CPQI, Three Emerging Trends in Green Banking: https://cpqi.com/3-emerging-trends-in-green-banking/[2] See statistics from the Dutch National Bank here: 574-evaluating-the-environmental-impact-of-debit-card-payments.pdf (dnb.nl)[3] See: https://www.tietoevry.com/en/newsroom/all-news-and-releases/other-news/2021/03/new-technology-and-knowledge-based-collaboration-in-norway-with-the-aim-of-creating-more-climate-friendly-bank-cards/[4] The Harvard Business Review: The Elusive Green Consumer, July 2019: https://hbr.org/2019/07/the-elusive-green-consumer[5] Nielsen Research, The Sustainability Imperative, October 2020: https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Global20Sustainability20Report_October202015.pdf", Hans Sjölund ,Sustainability , 24.6.2022
Public cloud security in turmoil,/en/blog/2022/06/public-cloud-security-in-turmoil/,Cloud / Pete Nieminen / 23.6.2022,"Experiences and opinions were initially very similar to those mentioned in discussions on traditional cybersecurity. Then the pandemic struck, the global market economy caught a cold, Russia invaded Ukraine, and Finland and Sweden made the decision to seek safety under the NATO umbrella.These topics are in the news on a daily basis, but let us have a look a bit further down the line.Hybrid-, information- and cyberwarfare catches many organisations by surprise. Even the best information security strategies, preparedness exercises and cybersecurity solutions are rendered useless when the main pillars of the infrastructure are not available as usual. We are used to a situation where the risks to enterprise architecture are caused by isolated threats, such as random cyberattacks, malware or technical issues with IT infrastructure. Organisations can protect themselves from problems by means of strategies, policies and often technology. With large-scale cyberwarfare, the emphasis is on hitting the enemy where it really hurts, which means targeting national infrastructure. Demanding action or blaming service providers for problems does not help when information systems have been hit by custom-built ransomware, telecommunications (including mobile networks) are down and experts cannot reach the workplace because card and mobile payments have stopped working and they cannot buy fuel or a bus ticket. There is a massive difference in scale between cybersecurity and cyberwarfare.People are becoming increasingly aware of the fact that urgent action is needed because the next few months will be a risky time for Finland. No-one knows how Russia or groups supporting its aims – such as cybercriminals – will react.Until recently, many doubted the security of public cloud services, and the responsibilities of users and service providers remained unclear. It is only now that people are starting to realise that the truth is completely different. Providers of hyperscale services spend vast amounts of money and time on improving cybersecurity every year. Because these services are available globally, their providers encounter a wide range of cyberattacks, often on a massive scale that smaller organisations or even national governments would encounter only in the context of cyberwarfare. Scenario practises and various risk analyses have shown that public cloud services are the most secure place for organisations to store information and carry out business activities – they are physically far removed from conflict zones. The initial assumption was that data – like people – would be safe and secure within physical borders. People have finally realised that the situation with data is the opposite and that the most secure solution is decentralised storage, spread across the virtual world.Does this mean that we can say good-bye to cybersecurity problems once our data storage and business activities are securely in the cloud?Unfortunately not. Cybersecurity risks are like energy: they never disappear, they just change their form. Indeed, respondents of the annual Flexera State of the Cloud report have listed data security as the main challenge with public cloud services for the last decade. In 2022, 85% of respondents still identified it as the number one challenge. The biggest challenge was initially that organisations and their IT service partners did not have sufficient knowledge about public cloud security.The first challenge with cybersecurity is the lack of sufficient knowledge.Public cloud service providers use a shared security responsibility model: this means that the service provider is responsible for the physical and data security of the public cloud it provides while the user of the service is responsible for the security of its own data (connections, identities, configurations and enterprise data).Image: Amazon Web Services shared security responsibility modelAlthough this model is straightforward, it causes a problem. Responsibility and accountability have always been a challenging aspect of cybersecurity. Almost no-one wants to assume responsibility, and there is a tendency to try to shift the responsibility for cybersecurity entirely to the service provider or data security partner or even push it onto the organisation’s own data security manager.The second challenge with cybersecurity is responsibility.If the public cloud is utilised correctly as a cloud-native solution, it does not fit in well with conventional operating models. Enterprise architecture models, such as TOGAF, include extensions for public cloud processes (Open Group Cloud Computing Work Group), but these are often inflexible and they do not allow for the full utilisation of the processes of constantly evolving, increasingly optimised and agile public cloud services.In terms of cybersecurity management and processes, the provider offering the public cloud service takes care of the security of its own physical infrastructure. The IT service partner does what has been agreed with the client. The client assumes that its partners will take care of data security issues and cybersecurity. Strategy-level coordination and management of roles and responsibilities is often left out of this triangle. Requests and requirements are communicated to the operational level, which turns them into practical technical solutions. Cybersecurity management is left to the data security manager or someone else in a similar role, and in-depth cooperation between the three parties is not possible due to a lack of management-level support.The third challenge with cybersecurity is governance and processes.“Purpose-built” is one of my favourite terms. It means that something has been designed and built for a specific purpose. In the world of IT, it means that something can only be used for a limited purpose. The public cloud is not this kind of solution. The public cloud offers almost unlimited possibilities, so it is in fact the exact opposite of a purpose-built solution. I believe that the public cloud can offer more reliable and resilient cybersecurity than any other IT ecosystem built for general use.If the three cybersecurity challenges I have listed above have existed since the introduction of public cloud, why have there not been serious security breaches or cybersecurity vulnerabilities? Any incidents have been occasional faults or small-scale data breaches that have affected the environments of individual clients. Public cloud (hyperscale) infrastructures have remained almost unbreachable, and no serious vulnerabilities have been identified in services built by IT service providers.When Windows operating systems made the leap from personal computers to servers, the majority of hackers and later cybercriminals chose Windows operating systems as their main target. Older UNIX systems and their applications in particular were largely spared from attacks. This target vector was not interesting because of the specialist knowledge required; Windows was an easier and more interesting target.At some point, Linux replaced Windows servers in demanding enterprise use, and today the majority of companies’ core business systems and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems run on Linux servers. Linux-based systems are also a common choice for running virtualisation platforms. The interests of cybercriminals have also changed, and Linux is today at least as interesting as a target as Windows server environments. Both attacking and protecting these systems requires more and more specialist knowledge.I believe that this is also the reason that has kept public cloud secure until now.The fourth and most significant challenge with cybersecurity is a evolving risk vector.The changing geopolitical situation emphasises the need for more stringent security requirements. The national and international economic situation means that operational scalability and ability to react fast are increasingly important and companies need agile cost-efficiency. The public cloud has become the place where all of these needs can be met at the same time. The cybersecurity challenges are still the same, however. Cybercriminals and those involved in cyberwarfare will find themselves a new, attractive and impactful target – public cloud services. Public cloud services will become the most lucrative target for cyberattacks over the course of this year.I personally believe strongly in the superiority of the public cloud as an IT ecosystem. Hyperscale providers do outstanding work in their efforts to secure their infrastructure, and they publish new data security capabilities on an almost weekly basis – in the case of optional data security components, the supply exceeds the demand. IT service providers have cybersecurity teams and services specialising in public cloud security, and data security companies are developing more and more sophisticated and effective data security technologies to secure the data stored in public cloud services.Tackling the challenges I have mentioned requires one additional change. Organisations utilising the public cloud must understand that cost-efficient does not automatically mean the same thing as cheap. All new things require effort and investment. For many organisations, saving money is the main reason for choosing the public cloud. Saving on the wrong thing will always lead to regret, regardless of whether the savings involve a conventional solution or a public cloud one.Want to know more?

The best thing was that a senior developer had noted my efforts,” says Henri.This work assignment at Tietoevry Create is the first job experience Henri has ever had. If they because of that had any suspense left, it was gone.“Some people say that it is hardest to find the first job. I applied to Tietoevry as I had become familiar with the versatile company already through student activities at Haaga-Helia.”Henri studied business information technology with a focus on software development, service design and UI/UX at Haaga-Helia, a business orientated university of applied sciences in Helsinki, Finland. They were selected to our Graduate Program in Autumn 2021 to work as frontend developer as well finalize thesis.Frontend development is something Henri has fancied since they were young. They practiced designing and coding service prototypes with beautiful user interfaces.Rewarding interactionHenri works for a customer in the pension insurance business. The software developer is part of a team that develops a renewed web service for handling personal customer's pension services. The goal is to design a more intuitive and effective digital service resulting in excellent customer experience.Henri has not only learned to design a navigation page and upload files but has had an opportunity to cooperate with backend developers.“It has been rewarding to talk about the technical implementation of the service with backend developers. They have openly listened to my viewpoints.”At the beginning of Tietoevry's Graduate Program, Henri had a whole month of induction and lots of time to practice coding.Henri Väisänen enjoyed Tietoevry's Graduate Program trip to Riga. They sang karaoke with Mathilda Smith.Active free time with other employeesWhat does Henri value in an employer?The answer is very straightforward: both the job with constant learning and close social relations. Already during their studying times at Haaga-Helia, Henri loved to cooperate with other people. They were an active member in Atkins, the students' association for Business Information Technology students.Now Henri has made friends with colleagues in the Graduate Program and through Tietoevry Young Professionals. It is a network, which brings together the young minded and active people working in the company.“Tietoevry has given us graduates a budget for organizing common program. We have, for instance, organized an event to prepare drinks with a bartender. That was fun!”Lately, Henri joined an internal breakfast event at Tietoevry Create in Espoo to hear about one of Tietoevry’s customers and its various project opportunities.“It is nice to learn new things and be part of developing our working culture. I was happy to hear that this kind of events will be organized also elsewhere in Finland.”To develop as a software developerWhen asked about free time hobbies, talkative Henri gets silent. Their time has gone to finishing the thesis – and to the above-mentioned social activities at our company.What does the future behold for this young professional, who has just graduated and has a permanent job at Tietoevry?“I want to develop as a frontend and full stack developer and work in different kind of projects to see where I fit best.”Henri prefers to use the inclusive “they"" as the singular third-person pronoun when speaking about themself.Ready to accelerate digital innovation? Check out our open positions at Tietoevry Create!", Henri Väisänen ,Meet our people , 22.6.2022

This is the one thing I have learned in my tenure here – if you are ready to accept a challenge and take on new responsibilities, your growth is unlimited.New challenge every two yearsI started as a senior developer in 2010. But funnily enough, around every two years, I've found myself playing a different role. Not intentionally, I have just said ‘yes’ to every new opportunity I was given. So, before my current position, I was at first a programmer, then an architect, then a solution architect, and finally a global solution head. I’ve moved countries and offices several times and still love it here.Moreover, I was not always an expert right from the beginning. To be fair, most of the time I actually had almost no idea what I was going to do. But I love to learn. And to this day, lifelong learning is the thing that keeps me going. Often customers have challenging requirements for which we need to propose solutions. If I don't have the existing knowledge to achieve that, then I go and do my research and try to understand. I love finding solutions.This applies to anyone who wants to join us at Tietoevry Transform – the only thing required is a hunger to learn. Skills are cheap – you can acquire them easily. But the attitude must be right.Extraordinary work cultureThere are things outside work that I’ve only been able to do because Tietoevry promotes growth and the work-life balance. For example, I have taken up running, because I have time for that now. In my previous company, when I left at 6.30 pm, colleagues would ask “Why are you leaving so early?” Now they ask “Why are you leaving so late?”.In addition, my son was born around the same time I joined the company. He is now 10 and hasn't seen me working anywhere else, while his mother has changed employer a few times.

Later on, it was construction work that inspired me. And while these things still bring me joy, being able to provide a smooth integration service for millions of people, one which will keep their lives going, keep them satisfied – that is one of the best feelings in the world.Taking care of the whole cityIn our team, we are responsible for the city of Stockholm’s integration platform and API management. Stockholm has set itself the goal to become the most online capital city in the world. This includes providing a first-class e-service and other e-solutions – and almost all of that goes through our platform. We have around 1000 APIs and about 250 million requests a month – it's a heavy load. And if something doesn’t work, then, for example, all the traffic in Stockholm will stop. So, when there's a problem, then not only does one user have a problem, millions have. To fix something on that big a scale, to make everything work again – that makes my day.But we are not just keeping everything ticking over on a daily basis, we’re also looking towards the future. Soon, for example, there will be an IoT platform that, for example, could keep track of whether the bins in the parks are empty or full, in order to make waste collection more efficient. Stockholm is a very progressive city constantly seeking ways to improve. We are delighted to be a part of that transformation.Progress in mindIn order to provide such forward-looking solutions, we need to have progress in our own mind, too. That is definitely supported by Tietoevry’s modern work culture. I would like to emphasize the fact that we have almost no hierarchy.

Artificial Intelligence guides routing and encourages teamwork at Posti,/en/blog/2022/06/artificial-intelligence-guides-routing-and-encourages-teamwork-at-posti/,Data / Data  Insiders / 9.6.2022,"A hands-on approach can give you a lot of insights when you are looking for challenges that could be tackled with data and artificial intelligence. Riku Tapper, Director of Data and Automation at Posti Group, has sorted parcels at a logistic centre and delivered newspapers in the dead of night to gain an impartial view about challenges that postal workers can face.“I know from experience that even a short delay can feel really long if you are waiting outside at a newspaper drop off point. Especially when its freezing cold and there is heavy sleet pouring down,” says Tapper, Director of Data and Automation at Posti Group.Soon after Tapper’s field research experience in newspaper delivery, all Posti delivery personnel started receiving real-time information on when newspapers are arriving.“Delivery work can be arduous. Relatively small things like knowing how long a wait will be can make things more pleasant and easier for our employees. If you know that there will be a fifteen-minute delay, you can go wait somewhere inside instead of shivering outdoors,” he notes.Posti employs more than 20,000 people. This means that there is never a shortage of development ideas coming from various sources in the organisation. Posti’s artificial intelligence projects are guided by three themes derived from the company’s strategy:improving customer experiences relating to package flows
enhancing workplace well-being for all Posti employees, and
strengthening environmental and social responsibility.Forecasts enable improved parcel routingDuring just the past year, package volumes have increased by 25%, and simultaneously the number of letters addressed directly to recipients have dropped by 14%. Tapper affirms that all kinds of change always create new opportunities.“We recently conducted a survey that showed that 87% of Finns have picked up packages from parcel lockers. Research shows that we often even prefer parcel lockers to home deliveries,” Tapper explains.It’s no wonder that the capacity of popular pickup locations is stretched to its limits during peak seasons such as Christmas. Regardless of how busy the season is, the customers are always happiest when their packages are routed to their preferred pickup locations.“When we decide where to route a package, we don’t know yet how many parcel lockers will actually be empty in several hours’ time. In the future, data and AI will help us predict this more accurately. We will be able to utilize our capacity much better and deliver as many packages as possible to the parcel lockers that the customers wished for,” Tapper describes.Posti can forecast what will happen in the next few hours by combining many different data sources:Timing: is it a weekday or weekend, a vacation season or a gift giving season?
Is the parcel locker located in an apartment building or a mall? How often do people usually visit the location?
Are some of the packages awaiting registered recipients whose previous pickup speed is known?
What knowledge do we have of the parcel’s contents? Is it consumer electronics or cat food – this too can have an effect on how soon the package is picked up.AI encourages teamwork between mail carriersTapper also talks about a new application that all mail carriers have on their mobile devices. The application utilizes artificial intelligence and it is called Route Master.“Route Master uses gamification and helps our mail carriers notice times when a colleague might need help. It is in wide use especially in larger cities,” Tapper says.The Route Master app encourages individual mail carriers to collaborate and teams to work together, as it gathers statistics and awards points for helping out colleagues.“Delivering mail is known as an individual sport but in the future, it can be carried out more as a team. Teamwork also improves workplace well-being, so using apps like Route Master can also be seen as a way of enhancing corporate social responsibility,” Tapper points out.Route planning decreased Posti’s carbon footprintIn accordance with its Zero Carbon 2030 commitment, Posti is on its way towards carbon free deliveries. Last year the company decreased its carbon footprint by 14%.“At the end of the workday, all of our drivers get automatic feedback on their driving. The report shows if their driving was economic, how much idling there was throughout the day and so forth. It helps our drivers change their driving style to cut our carbon footprint,” Tapper says.Posti also uses data and forecast models to optimize the home delivery routes. This saves both fuel and time and streamlines the drivers’ work.“The 14% decrease in our carbon footprint comes from a combination of factors. We provide our drivers feedback, we use renewable fuels and electric vehicles – but decreasing the number of kilometres driven has been one of the main actions contributing to our smaller carbon footprint,” Tapper emphasizes.Posti also has a pilot project ongoing in Vantaa, in which customers can determine a more precise time window for the delivery and follow the driver in real-time.“Data and AI can help the environment, postal workers, and customers alike when each route is individually optimized utilizing various data sources,” Tapper remarks.Employees partake in data development“All of our strategic focus areas have some kind of digital aspect – it plays a very significant role here,” Tapper underlines.Posti sees many opportunities for utilizing AI to help solve challenges of all sizes.“When it comes to very simple AI solutions, like parcel sorting machines, our employees have decades of experience of working with them. In recent years we have started investing more resources into technology and much more sophisticated AI development,” Tapper says.“We have about 50 data and automation experts in our organization – and loads more employees who are also enthusiastic about data development. We have many different training initiatives going on around Posti to make sure that everyone who wants to learn more, can,” Tapper adds.In years to come, Tapper hopes to see more and more Posti employees partaking in development work and coding themselves. The civic data science trend could also be seen in Tietoevry’s Data x Business -report.“The closer we get the actual development work to the business, the better. We want to offer our employees the opportunity to learn how to build machine learning algorithms themselves and solve challenges directly,” he envisions.The article is written based on the podcast in Finnish.Listen to the podcast (in Finnish).Find all the newest DataInsiders podcast episodes in English here.", Data  Insiders ,Data , 9.6.2022
Intelligent Customer Experience drives digital futures,/en/blog/2022/06/intelligent-customer-experience-drives-digital-futures/,Digitalization / Mikko Sjöblom / 9.6.2022,"Let me explain: As experiences themselves are human cognitive processes, it is surprising that it is data, composed of 1’s and 0’s, that is humanizing the customer experiences of tomorrow.There is something deeply human in the term experience. Experiences are not exact, not very quantifiable, and not very repeatable. If you buy and eat an ice-cream with a friend today, the experience cannot be replicated fully tomorrow because of other things than the service or product itself. Your experience is affected also by environmental factors such as weather, your mood, your friend’s mood, salesperson, and many other variables. You might get close to original, but not exactly.  On the other hand, computers are extremely exact, very quantifiable and they excel in repeating things with 100% accuracy. However, the challenge with digitally driven customer journeys is that they lack the sensitivity to customers’ context and human needs.When we interact with service providers, people, or machines, the last thing we want to feel is that we are talking to a machine. We do not want to be reduced to a segmented persona following a pre-meditated path through the customer experience, but instead feel that we had a real interaction, the service was adapted to our needs and personalized, and the service provider understood and respected our feelings and even showed empathy.“In the decades ahead, improving offerings with customer data will be a prerequisite for staying in the game, and it may give incumbents an edge over new entrants”
HBR Competitive Strategy: When Data Creates Competitive StrategyRe-humanizing CX does not need lots of data, but right dataTo take the next step in customer experience, we will need to combine software crafted experiences, logic burned in hardware chips and data stored in cloud to deliver real-time experiences that will please the “wetware” receptors and synapses in our brains and our embedded desire to be social, sensing, intelligent beings. Data, 1s and 0s, that will play a key role in re-humanizing our customer experiences.Many organizations are collecting a lot of information about their customers through various digital touchpoints and analytic solutions, but most also struggle in utilizing the data to grow customer value. First and most obvious problem is often the siloed data. Data gathered from one channel cannot be utilized in another.Luckily, there are many tried and tested technical solutions for solving this problem. Customer Data Platforms (CDP), Data Lakes, CRM systems, and others can all mitigate the siloed data.But this brings us to the deeper challenge. Data is often collected without a clear idea about how it exactly will be utilized, and which use cases the data should enable. Data platforms are designed separately from customer experience, and this leads into discrepancies between CX vision and available data. It is a bit like a restaurant where the head chef would source the week's ingredients without knowing what would be on the menu that week.Our experience at Tietoevry Create is that customer data and customer experience are indistinctly linked and should be designed in parallel. For a globally operating retailer, one of our customers, we recently designed 40 service and loyalty concepts with the sole purpose of helping them populate their CDP with right kind of data points.Adaptive and automatedLet’s then explore what right data can enable and how it can lead to better and more emotionally satisfying customer journeys.Some years ago digital customer journeys tended to be quite rigid and based on pre-determined segmentation. This can lead to challenges, for instance, in situations where the same customer returns in a different context. You might fly with an airline as a business traveler during the week and then embark on a family trip a few days later with hugely different expectations and needs.So, what could help? Leading companies are using customer data proactively to identify more accurately the customer's current context. Where each customer might be on her journey right now, what information or guidance does she need and what is the next best action to take.Next Best Action (NBA) is a customer-centric marketing approach that considers multiple different actions that could be taken for a specific customer and then provides the best one.These days NBA thinking is being increasingly applied also to create customer journeys of digital interaction that are adaptive and responsive to customer's context and needs. The better we understand the customer’s current situation and what she wants to accomplish right now, the better equipped we are to offer her the right product or service. Without feeling that they have been “sold to.”Hyper-personalizationIt is an age-old practice to tailor and personalize the service for one’s most important customers. This used to be a very manual process; a shopkeeper would recognize recurring customers, greet them by their first name and adjust the service for their needs. However, this individualized touch is very much tied to the individual delivery – and difficult to scale.  This is well evidenced in travel and hospitality sector, where the biggest difference between top-of-the-line luxury hotel and “a good high-end hotel” is not so much about the quality of the facilities and room amenities, but the ratio between personnel and guests. Some of the top-line cruise lines can have more staff on board compared to passengers.Digital tools offer an interesting opportunity to scale that luxury experience without having to hire a personal butler for all customers. As an example, some mid-range cruise lines are using wearable devices that act as cabin keys and payment methods, but also allow the service staff to know who you are and what your preferences are. Replicating the service experience of higher category products.This also creates a positive spiral where customers expect a better, more personalized experience. Customers want us to use the data we need to tailor their journeys in parallel with treating their data as our most prized possession - and what it is! We need to be transparent, secure, and logical in our data use.Emphatic at scaleThe ability to understand the feelings of another, empathy. Why is it so important in customer experience and building digital engagement?Because very few things are as annoying as the feeling you get from interacting with a machine. We want to be understood, and we want to be treated with respect for our feelings and needs.In 1-2-1 human interactions, it is easy to be empathetic. We also tend to teach it to our children. But teaching a digital marketing funnel or guest service mobile application to understand and be mindful of users’ feelings is way trickier.The last 5-10 years have seen human-centered disciplines such as service design, usability, accessibility, user experience design, and ethnographic research enter the stage of digital experience design. Human sciences have an unequal footing with engineering, architecture, and solution platforms.  However, to complete the holy trinity of Intelligent Customer Experience we not only need human centric design methods and technology, but a comprehensive approach to collecting and utilizing customer data. Most organizations today are good at it, but very few excel in utilizing the data.To provide empathy at scale, you need to have a clear link between your data strategy, customer experience strategy and technology platforms.Customer data for better experiences - in practiceOne of the Finnish leaders in utilizing customer data for better experiences is Musti Group, best known for their pet-care stores Musti & Mirri. We, Tietoevry Create’s Advisory team, helped Musti Group to set a new standard for winning customer experience by utilizing advanced customer data capabilities.To build truly intelligent and empathic customer journeys in a digitalized world, we need to understand our customers better than ever - what creates and destroys value. We also need to have a solid customer data architecture connecting and driving customer journeys in real time. Delivering agile and adaptive, hyper-personal and emphatic experiences with the scale and repeatability that only a computer can.Only then will your customers no longer feel that they are talking with a machine.Would you like to share your thoughts with us?Tietoevry Create and our cross-functional Experience team helps organizations to discover the opportunities in data-driven customer experience and bring the data from business systems to customer journeys and touchpoints.

4 use cases where non-bank financial institutions can leverage virtual accounts,/en/blog/2022/06/4-use-cases-where-non-bank-financial-institutions-can-leverage-virtual-accounts/,Digitalization / Torill H.  Larsen  / 6.6.2022,"For Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI’s) there is a need to identify and sometimes segregate client money (Escrow services). This is especially true for Fund Managers, Pension fund managers, Insurance brokers and the like. Often the issues relate to the sheer quantity of the payments, identifying where they came from, allocating them back to the owner but still retaining a total overall position. Up to now operating physical bank accounts has been the most common way for companies to manage this but this is cumbersome and expensive.Virtual accounts offer a much easier solution because they can be allocated to individual NBFI customers which are then linked to the “real” or physical account. In this way they can be used to represent individual customers of the NBFI. This then allows for individual user tracking of the account movements, making for easier and improved insights into the client base.The key benefit that VAM brings to NBFIs includes the ability to reduce their real accounts while offering an enhanced service to their clients. Using virtual accounts in this way allows the NBFI to operate with fewer real accounts while serving their customers in multiple ways. VAM offers NBFIs flexibility and choice in what they can offer their clients and helps with fulfilling regulatory requirements on segregation for managing clients or investors funds.For NBFIs the VAM solution delivers real-time visibility and operational control of client funds, it also smooths transaction allocations and interest apportionment at the underlying client level. The solution that the banking and transactional services and administration are performed by customer users.We offer a highlight of 4 areas where this capability brings great value for the corporate:1. Cash and Currency overviewThe beauty of virtual accounts is that they can be hierarchical in nature so the ability for a NBFI to segregate their client data into different reporting classes is possible. VAM also provides multi-currency capability so the NBFI end client can be provided with accurate information on the position in different currencies. In addition, VAM supports cross currency pooling which enhances liquidity and reduces FX costs. With VAM a complete segregation of funds, on the level of the NBFI customer’s own funds and the funds of its clients, is available. Overview of funds of the clients is visible on multiple levels for further segregation.2. Marketplace overviewAnother area where VAM can add value is the internet marketplace space. Marketplace firms such as Amazon, eBay, Etsy etc deal with many vendors and act as intermediaries connecting buyers and sellers online. Virtual accounts can also offer new capabilities for these companies to manage their finances while at the same time reducing costs and improving reporting.An issue for marketplace firms is how to manage the quantity of receivables from multiple clients and allocate those receivables to the correct account. A virtual receivables account uses a published virtual IBAN for payments collections. These virtual accounts can then be linked to their physical IBAN accounts. So, a typical application of a virtual receivables account enables payments collections from end customers in an efficient manner.3. Commission and fee managementAnother case is the handling of merchant payments and charges, typically commissions and fees. The ability to allocate multiple virtual accounts to specific items, in this case, commissions or fees makes the task easier and because it can be fully automated errors are less likely.4. Geography specific overviewsVirtual accounts are ideal when a company needs to collect balance information centrally and the aggregated amounts represent different parts of the company’s business. An example might be a travel company which is split on a geographical basis.In addition, while the marketplace company may operate from a single location it is quite usual for its customers to be based in multiple countries. Virtual IBANs can help here, as they offer a multi-currency, multi-jurisdictional banking solution for foreign exchange (FX) and payments organisations without the need for a different banking relationship in each country. For example, businesses can direct payments into a separate virtual IBAN accounts in local currencies that are controlled from a master IBAN account. Creating sub-accounts for regions, product ranges, and even customers in this way makes managing customer payments, settlement, and reconciliation much easier.", Torill H.

"Tissue demand is growing, do you want a slice of the market?",/en/blog/2022/06/tissue-demand-is-growing-do-you-want-a-slice-of-the-market/,Sustainability / Arto  Huuhilo / 1.6.2022,"With tissue demand predicted to grow around 4 percent year-on-year up to 2025, one of the fastest-growing wood fibre businesses, many existing mills are retooling for tissue production, and new players are entering the market.To reach sufficient scale to obtain profitable market share, as well as increase the industry’s negotiating power regarding both raw material producers and the retail market, consolidation within the industry is expected to gather pace.New lucrative business, but with faster pace and cost pressuresThree factors are particularly relevant in the tissue industry.Tissue is consumer business where sustainability is leading trend.
Tissue products are fast-moving consumer goods – 65% are sold to consumers. Especially, new entrants need to adapt to moving at a faster pace.
The predominance of the consumer market requires preparedness to produce and sell enough at lower margins.A make-to-stock business, as tissue is, requires accurate and fast demand forecasting. This is compounded by the need to react quickly to rapid changes in demand.Production optimization is of utmost importance. The most crucial things to focus on are runnability because most tissue mills also convert the product, and processing line optimization.Tissue business and sustainabilitySince Tissue is pretty much consumer business and consumers are ecologically conscious nowadays, their buying decisions direct producers towards sustainable operations.It is not only about the sustainability of the end product, like reducing packing materials or replacing plastics in wrappings etc. Quest for sustainability must also cover production and raw materials.In practical terms, when you get more yield from your production and consume less resources to do that, high production efficiency supports your sustainability targets.Obviously, getting more with less is not only about sustainability but also impacts to profitability.MES, the efficient middleman between corporate ERP and automationBecause the optimization of the entire value chain is crucial for a tissue mill’s success, a MES (Manufacturing Execution System) system is a top priority for production efficiency, product traceability and integrated quality.MES sits in the middle of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and automation, enabling harmonized production business processes and standard integration to automation. It improves production efficiency with planning, linking Tissue paper making and Converting planning together. It also enables traceability of chemicals and gives detailed consumption figures for costing purposes, and provides harmonized, detailed Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) reporting for benchmarking between production lines and mills.A well-designed MES runs locally and thereby ensures business continuity enabling 24/7 production also when centralized systems are not available. This is important as mills are often small and in places where networks are not very reliable.Keep costs in check while making the most of productionTietoevry’s TIPS for Tissue solution checks all the boxes of an efficient solution for tissue manufacturers.It helps you towards fast, accurate demand planning, and gives quick reports on raw material consumption, costs, and profits even in quickly varying situations. Production planning is integrated with purchasing, ensuring all needed resources are available to produce the right products at the right time at maximum speed. It improves runnability on the shop floor, maximizing operational efficiency. Quality information follows every jumbo roll, and variable branding for retail is easy to do.Because TIPS for Tissue is enabled for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), it can help pinpoint optimal parameters even for processes almost impossible to measure, such as runnability, with soft sensors. TIPS accumulates vast amounts of information that help your production optimisation.Tietoevry, the tissue manufacturer’s trusted partnerTietoevry has more than 50 years’ experience as a partner for the pulp and fibre-based industries, all the way down to retail.

Agile digital leaps towards more efficient data use in a global company,/en/blog/2022/05/agile-digital-leaps-towards-more-efficient-data-use-in-a-global-company/,Data / Thomas Kirk / 31.5.2022,"UPM offers a uniquely broad view to the modern bio and forest industry even for a seasoned leader like Tero Miikki, who has over 15 years of solid experience with numerous data ventures in different companies. UPM’s data ecosystem includes hundreds if not thousands of systems. UPM’s factories alone produce vast masses of data. The company has 55 factories around the world, and each factory has over 500,000 sensors, continuously providing information on how process flows.When Miikki joined UPM, he knew that there was a clear need for data clarification. In a relatively short time, the Data Management Office led by Miikki has implemented dozens upon dozens of agile projects for UPM’s different business areas and functions, helping thousands of UPM employees who use data to support decision making and to guide daily work.Mandate to ”unleash the data” came straight from the top management“Data warehousing and analytics have been employed for ages at UPM,” Miikki says. ”So UPM has capability, there is no question about it.”“However, the role of data and digitalization will continuously strengthen in years to come. All companies that wish to remain competitive are now strongly focused on developing their data capabilities,” he adds.”At UPM, our focus is on ensuring that we have reliable, high-quality data at our disposal at the right time. To achieve this, we have had to answer many questions: How should we accelerate data processing? How could we ensure that we manage and use data even better? What steps do we take when launching new factories or new business areas?” Tero Miikki lists.Few years ago, UPM’s top management decided to shift to a higher gear. They recruited Miikki to build UPM’s new Data Management Office and gave him one key piece of advice: “Unleash the data”.”At that time, rich masses of data were still stuck in our organization. Our priority was unleashing this data so it could be utilized to aid decision making and create new business opportunities,” Miikki reminisces.Making better use of the vast masses of data presented a big challenge, but the journey got off to an excellent start. Tero Miikki and his team have made swift progress.Miikki was able to start his work with practically a clean slate. His gradually growing team focused on the architecture at first, but soon moved to implementing projects, one at a time: the demand for data applications was so great. In addition to offering technical solutions, Miikki and his team have also made great progress in simplifying the overall architecture. This has enabled them to offer high quality, real-time information to support decision making while simultaneously accelerating the pace of development.The Heads of Data share information in two directionsUPM has six separate business areas and the same number of functions – and the Data Management Office has carried out agile projects for all of these 12 areas. The scope of the completed projects is considerable, ranging all the way from compiling financial data to help in pulp pricing to putting machine learning to use to predict possible problems in production.UPM’s cloud-based data platform has also been built one project at a time. Preparedness for growth and scalability have been driving principles from day one and the numbers speak for themselves: between 30 and 40 different projects were carried out in last year alone.Quite soon after starting the development work, Tero Miikki and his team recognised that organizing data governance was paramount.“We had to create a way to manage needs: requests for data projects simply could not come individually from almost 20,000 different people. Appointed Heads of Data for each of our 12 areas became one of the main drivers of success from the early stages of our development work,” Miikki explains.The Heads of Data choose which data projects will be carried out in their area based on the area’s vision, roadmap, and strategy – Miikki’s team never starts developing anything without approval from the Head of Data. UPM also has 12 information architects and numerous data owners who collaborate with the Heads of Data.“Success is such a strong word; I would not use it yet. But we are pleased to say that our data governance has got off to an excellent start during the past 1,5 years and we are taking decisive steps in the right direction. We have established a good rhythm for meetings on strategic, tactical, and operational levels and our top management and Heads of Data have enthusiastically engaged in fostering our journey,” Miikki describes.Tero Miikki affirms that the data culture has gradually changed at UPM as data responsibilities and capabilities have been purposefully decentralized throughout the organisation. Now, it is not only the Data Management Office's own architects who talk about data every day, numerous others do so as well.Miikki emphasises that compelling communication is a crucial enabler for all the development work.“I wanted to make sure that everybody involved always knew what is going on. When I started this job, I sent weekly emails to guarantee that everyone was in the loop. Now, we have a dedicated team focusing solely on our communication. They ensure that each area of UPM gets a regular flow of tailored and relevant information about how their data projects are advancing. You need to establish a set rhythm in communication, just like you do with data governance meetings on different levels,” he emphasises.The digital and data strategy is built on a strong foundation of trustOver the past years, UPM has focused on roles and capabilities. Technologies have also been honed and the organization has gained experience in scaling projects. Case by case, the company has learned what kind of data needs exist right now. The next question to tackle is identifying how data and digitalization can serve UPM in the future.“Once we established a foundation of trust, we started creating UPM’s digital and data strategy for upcoming years. We identified nine lighthouse projects, which were approved by our top management, and which all have top executives as their sponsors,” Miikki says.The contents for the nine lighthouse initiatives are currently being developed as a crowdsourcing venture by nearly 100 UPM employees from different countries.“We have tried to involve UPM employees from very different backgrounds and with diverse responsibilities to ensure that we get broadscale input for our strategy work. We are also getting valuable input from outside our organisation,” Miikki says.“One of the lighthouse initiatives is ”Intelligent Operations”, which focuses on the digitalization of UPM’s factory ecosystems. Other lighthouse initiatives have to do with, for example, further enhancing customer service, honing our supply chain, and digital sourcing. We also have internal focus areas such as employee experience and people competence,” Miikki remarks.You can expect quick results from this team: Tero Miikki estimates that very soon, within months, good visibility will have been achieved in all nine lighthouse initiatives. At this point Miikki and his team will roll up their sleeves and start implementing the strategy. We look forward to seeing the next results from UPM's agile data and digital capability development!The article is written based on the podcast in Finnish.Listen to the podcast (in Finnish)", Thomas Kirk ,Data , 31.5.2022
Security is paramount when migrating your SAP into the Public Cloud,/en/blog/2022/05/security-is-paramount-when-migrating-your-sap-into-the-public-cloud/,Cloud / Antti  Heinonen / 24.5.2022,"Here at Tietoevry we have focused a lot of effort to ensure that security of SAP on public cloud is as worry-free as possible. For example, we have created a publicly available security whitepaper and additionally a very detailed security policy document about how security for SAP is achieved, and we maintain it continuously as both the public cloud and SAP evolve. These documents are a result of our years of experience with our SAP and Public Cloud customers.Here are some of the most crucial areas for consideration regarding security of SAP on Public Cloud:1. GovernanceTaking security into account already in the company’s Cloud Governance is important. The governance contains the rules by which everybody must operate their workloads and companywide security requirements are defined here. Common processes like naming conventions or resource locations passively contribute to security.2. Cloud Architecture / SAP LandscapeTietoevry SAP on Public Cloud reference architecture is the starting point for all our customer engagements. The reference architecture has been designed with security in mind and contains various cloud-native mechanisms for improving customer SAP security. Our specialists can consider customer security requirements and implement those into the SAP on Public Cloud architecture.The important thing is to consider all connectivity requirements, attack vectors, and good old anti-virus solutions. We keep evolving the reference architecture to make sure all our customers are always protected and optimized.3. Managed services for SAP Basis and Managed CloudProviding 24/7 support for the deployed SAP on Public Cloud environment is the most important link in the chain for security. Proactive threat monitoring, incident management, and fast responses to alerts or suspicious activity can mean the difference between a compromised environment or a failed attack. Our managed service teams are supported by, for example, our monitoring tooling and rules to identify attack vectors before customers even notice. No disruption to business continuity.If you have not considered these three crucial areas from a security perspective, you should address them immediately. We at Tietoevry are happy to help you!Tietoevry SAP on Public Cloud engagement is split into multiple phasesOur first phase is a customer readiness check where we help the customer understand cloud fundamentals and manage expectations.
The second phase, design, is where our architects work with the customer to evaluate requirements and how security can be achieved when migrating SAP to the public cloud.
The third phase is the actual implementation/migration of the workload. During this phase, all the designed security controls will be established and verified.
The fourth and fifth phases are then the daily operations and continuous optimization phases during which our managed teams make sure the environment is operating within parameters and continuously improved/optimized for increased efficiency and security.The Tietoevry SAP on Public Cloud security policy contains detailed, technical considerations regarding how security can be achieved in any SAP on Public Cloud scenario. The policy is used during a Tietoevry SAP on Public Cloud project.", Antti  Heinonen ,Cloud , 24.5.2022
Security awareness to resist social engineering,/en/blog/2022/05/security-awareness-to-resist-social-engineering/,Digitalization / Håkon Haugsten Hansen / 18.5.2022,"By having access to the internet, the attackers could be everywhere and anyone. The attacker could attack the technical systems (utilize technical vulnerabilities), the humans controlling the systems (utilizing cognitive biases), or a combination of these two.Bugs in the human hardwareWhen attacking the human(s) controlling the system, the attacker takes advantage of  psychological manipulation techniques, where they influence human(s) to perform actions or disclose confidential information. This attacking technique is often referred to as social engineering, which is based on specific attributes of human decision-making known as cognitive biases. In comparison to technical vulnerabilities, social engineering use known cognitive biases as a bug to get past the human firewall. In fact, a staggering 98% of cyber-attacks rely on humans falling victims to social engineering.Six principles to understand social engineeringIn theory, psychologist Robert Cialdini established six principles upon which social engineering relies heavily upon. The six key principles are:Reciprocity – People tend to return a favor. In social engineering, the attacker could imply that the victim must do an action in return or just imply that there will be a negative consequence if a certain action is not performed. 
Commitment and Consistency – If people commit, orally or in writing, to an idea or goal, they are more likely to honor that commitment.  
Social proof / Consensus - People will do things that they see other people doing. In social engineering, the attacker could imply that this is a normal procedure to increase the likelihood of adherence from the victim. 
Authority - We tend to obey figures of authority. In social engineering, the attacker may pose as authority to increase the likelihood of adherence from the victim. 
Liking / Familiarity - People are easily persuaded by other people whom they like. In social engineering, the attacker may pose as a known likable figure to increase the likelihood of adherence from the victim. 
Scarcity / Urgency - We perceive something to be more valuable when it is less available. In social engineering, the attacker could imply that it is “limited time only” in their request to increase the likelihood of adherence from the victim.The attacker utilizes these principles when performing vishing, smashing, and phishing attacks. All these attacks have that in common that they are performed against a human victim with the aim of them disclosing information.Security culture is an important firewallHaving employees with knowledge of how to spot social engineering attempts is and will remain to be, important to reduce the risk of being attacked. Academic research establishes that employees often do not see themselves as part of the organization's information security firewall, and often take actions that ignore organizational information security best interests. Furthermore, research clarifies the need for having an information security culture as a continuous process to improve security. This is also backed by digital development and the evolving threat landscape. One example is the development of Deepfakes – a technique utilizing artificial intelligence to create a video or voice of a person in which their face, body, or voice has been digitally altered so that they appear to be someone else or doing or saying something which they never did or said. Today, attackers use this technology in vishing to create attacks that are challenging your employees’ knowledge to spot social engineering attempts in a much greater way than before. Just a few years back, in 2020, a bank in Hong Kong was scammed for 35 million dollars, where the attackers were using deep voice.Are your employees ready?Learn 10 top tips to prevent Cyber attacks here", Håkon Haugsten Hansen ,Digitalization , 18.5.2022
"Energy market still in constant flux, digitalizing helps adaptation",/en/blog/2022/05/energy-market-still-in-constant-flux-digitalizing-helps-adaptation/,Sustainability / Matti  Seppänen  / 17.5.2022,"Sustainability and decarbonization as driversBoth the consumer and business-to-business energy markets are increasingly being driven by a quest for reducing the present dependence on fossils. This effort has accelerated fast in Western Europe in recent times due to the political-military situation in the southeast.Whenever decarbonization and renewable energy forms are discussed, electrification rises to the top as the solution. Decarbonization is the goal, achievable by shifting from fossils to alternative energy sources. Biofuels are a natural first source to look at, but they require additive components that need to be transported over long distances, somewhat negating the benefit.This means the main contender for filling the gap is wind power, with solar power in second place. But how can we efficiently adapt our need for power to generation that relies on largely unpredictable, weather-dependent energy sources?Technology and ecosystems as solutionsInvesting in IT and OT solutions are the primary way energy industry actors are currently adapting to market changes, while the study also highlights strategy renewal, organizational changes, internal efficiency increases and new business models.Ecosystems and cooperating are essential to cover the entire value chain. Cooperation between stakeholders is inevitable to control the system, manage it and gain insight into the value chain to be able to manage it from beginning to end.Cloudification is a topical issue when increasing the level of digitalization and collaboration in the value chain. Public cloud seems to be the most efficient way to run solutions because of faster development cycles, avoidance of integration projects. Additionally, shared data is more easily accessible.Customer empowerment a primary goal, but not without caveatsInsight over the value chain, customer experience and engaging customers as active players in the energy market, are seen as the most important benefits of digitalization in all Nordics. This trend has now become even more pronounced than in 2018.In the next years, the energy consumption of customers will have to be managed more closely to be able to reconcile energy used and renewable energy provided.Many energy companies already allow their customers with the possibility of monitor, control, and optimize their energy usage, but experience shows that consumers’ interest dwindles quickly. This is why there have to be ways of controlling energy usage to ensure security of supply. If market forces are unable to achieve this through pricing or demand response, the worst-case scenario could be authority-imposed rolling blackouts.There is now also an opportunity for new energy actors to provide demand response services. These can be energy communities whose members both buy energy from the grid and sell their own micro-produced energy to the grid. Or it could be a company operating at many locations that feeds X kWh of its self-generated power into the grid and can offer its customers the same X kWh for charging their electric vehicles, for example, at times of lower consumption. The legislation, technology, payment systems and settlement methods already exist.The four keys to a working energy futureTo summarize, there are four intertwined issues that will ensure a viable and profitable future for energy while at the same time making sure sustainability and climate goals are reached.New information and operational technology solutions allow a much bigger picture of the energy market and its optimization than traditional models.Ecosystems are needed to make this work throughout the value chain, while cloudification as vehicle provides new way-of-working as platform.Customer participation in the energy market therefore becomes possible, with demand response taking care of a fair distribution of availability in different situations.Would you like to know more?

Guest blog: Digitalization journey in the Formula 1 world,/en/blog/2022/05/digitalization-journey-in-the-formula-1-world/,Digitalization / Mark  Gallagher  / 16.5.2022,"Although the first Formula 1 World Championship was staged in 1950, it was not until the mid-1980’s that the sport began to replace mechanical technologies with digital solutions. The first steps involved computerised engine-management systems but, as software development accelerated, engineers soon began to deploy solutions in all areas.Digital technologies as the game changerToday, on the eve of the 2022 World Championship, the sport has seen every aspect of its operations and business outcomes revolutionised by its decision to fully embrace digital technologies.Consider that today’s Formula 1 cars are not only the fastest we have seen but also the safest, most reliable and energy efficient. A whole series of apparent conflicts - faster but safer, for example - have been made possible because the sport has developed deep insights into problem-solving. In simple terms, F1 teams and drivers no longer ‘hope’ for great outcomes, they go into an event ready to make decisions based on knowledge, information and data.It was the need to better manage risk and guarantee the safety of drivers that accelerated Formula 1’s data-driven journey. Starting in the mid-1990’s, the focus on better managing risk and improving outcomes led to data being analysed, trends examined and problems solved.As computerised systems began to be employed on Formula 1 car design, development and operations, clear business benefits began to emerge. Reducing waste, improving manufacturing efficiency and ensuring better outcomes from R&D budgets were early wins.A Formula 1 team is a technology company involved in low volume, prototype manufacturing. By digitising design technologies, and ultimately creating a ‘digital twin’ of the car, F1 teams stopped using a highly expensive, iterative process of trial and error during development. Instead, all designs and systems are developed, tested and proven in a virtual environment before teams ever commit to the expense of manufacturing.Data security is uppermost in the minds of F1’s CIOsOne of the most powerful examples of Formula 1 teams’ use of data comes during a Grand Prix event when the car is interrogated real-time. One thousand channels of information are monitored to ensure the performance of the car, its systems and driver. Problems are instantly spotted, trends monitored and performance optimised.The teams no longer even make all their decisions at the circuit. Instead, a group of engineers work remotely back at headquarters. This team of performance engineers and strategists use the power of real time data analysis to deliver fast, high quality decisions.It comes as no surprise to learn that data security is uppermost in the minds of F1’s CIOs. The value is no longer in the car, it’s in the data belonging to the business. For it is in securely generating, storing and accessing information that Formula 1 teams depend for both sporting excellence and business performance.Mark Gallagher was the keynote speaker in Tietoevry Pulp, Paper & Fibre Industry Event on April 26.", Mark  Gallagher  ,Digitalization , 16.5.2022

However, it requires a personalized approach and a data-driven understanding of customers’ needs.Existing or new customers – which ones bring the most value?What differentiates a potential customer from an existing one or, in banking terminology, “in books”? With masses of available data, a bank can acquire highly relevant information about any individual. As a result, it has become common practice to know your customer (to some extent) from the very beginning of the customer journey. On the other hand, data is far more precious, if it is being collected while a customer is an active client. Such data allows you to analyze the customer’s behavior in relation to transactions, savings, loans, investments, etc. And it’s based on this that our recommender system can deliver significant benefits.Figure 1.

Are mothers the solution to our tech problem?,/en/blog/2022/05/are-mothers-the-solution-to-our-tech-problem/,Sustainability / Camilla Sorknes / 5.5.2022,"Whether you're a parent or not, I want to highlight the positive ripple effects of encouraging our girls to choose a career in tech. Not only do we need greater diversity to find good solutions for the entire population, but we also need more technologists. The business sector desperately lacks IT expertise. Only 29 per cent of IT workers are women. Last year only 35 per cent of applicants for engineering and technology subjects from the Norwegian Universities and College Admission Services were girls.Girls believe tech is complicated and boringOn behalf of Tietoevry, YouGov recently surveyed the Finnish and Norwegian population on their thoughts on technology as a career path. The numbers are grim with only 15 per cent of girls aged 15-25 considering an education in technology. Almost half of the girls surveyed say they opt out of IT and technology because it seems boring and too complicated.As our society is being digitised, we depend entirely on perspectives from different genders and backgrounds to create innovation, solve challenges and meet future demands.Parents have a significant influence over children’s career choicesThe same survey also shows that parents are an important influence when young people choose their education and career path. The first spark of interest in technology is often lit in childhood. That is why it is so important to have good female role models who can inspire and educate girls about all the possibilities in the world of technology. This is where I think mothers have a significant role! If we manage to convince them, we may be able to inspire more girls to see the thrill and opportunities within technology.How do we inspire girls?I think it is crucial that we as an industry change the way we talk about IT and technology. We need to highlight how technology affects the development of our society and how meaningful technology creates solutions that influence and change people's lives. It is also worth dwelling on that if future solutions are developed exclusively by men, it is also developed for men. Diversity is essential, both for society in general and for the business sector.We must include both girls and boys.Read more: Why you should influence your daughter to choose a career in technology", Camilla Sorknes ,Sustainability , 5.5.2022
“Good master data is essential for company management”,/en/blog/2022/05/good-master-data-is-essential-for-company-management/,Data / Data  Insiders / 5.5.2022,"Kristiina Lammila, CIO of Ahlstrom-Munksjö, visited the Data Insiders podcast to share her learnings on their data journey.Background work for proper master data management started already years ago, but back then, there was no realization on the business side why the data quality – and data and analytics in themselves – were so crucial for success.A fast forward to this moment, and things look quite the opposite. “Nowadays, we look at daily dashboards rather than monthly PowerPoints. Data is available a lot easier than before, and people can drill down to the details in cases. Actually, our organization started to understand the value of data surprisingly quickly. We have progressed in a data-driven mindset very well during the last months, but there is still work to be done.”The new ownership brought along a more data-driven mindsetThis remarkable change evolved as a combination of culture and capabilities. In February 2021, Ahlstrom-Munksjö came under the new ownership of Bain Capital, a very data-driven investment firm. Lammila lists an impressive amount of projects her team has been working on during the last year, in the areas of data and analytics:Building a company level data lake solution
Revisiting reporting principles
Building several new dashboards
…and last but not least, starting to build a data-driven company culture.Read also: “Use as easy tools as you can” – ICA Gruppen has a shared data toolbox but distributed project ownershipQuick wins and long-term development“One of the projects we initiated quite quickly after the new owners entered the company was called Victory – the word referring to the idea behind the whole data usage. This data, reporting, and analytics project focused on corporate reporting, finance, and customers, as well as production. It includes a Microsoft Azure-based data lake solution and Power BI-based dashboards.”The concrete outcomes proved to everyone at Ahlstrom-Munksjö how useful it is to get real-time insights and understand what happens behind the numbers – so much so that the owner is now presenting the project to its other portfolio companies as a benchmark.“In very close cooperation between IT, business, Bain Capital, and partners, we have been able to crack several nuts quickly”, Lammila sums it up.But there is more to come, as Ahlstrom-Munksjö aims to harmonize its master data management (MDM) and fix even more fundamental issues in the data architecture across the global functions and businesses.“In 2020 we launched a massive project that is now speeding up to full mode towards the end of this year. It’s called Stella: a holistic business platform renewal program including processes, ERP, and MES systems. Data and analytics are an essential part of that.”Better capabilities for sustainability governanceAhlstrom-Munksjö is one of the world's leading players in sustainable fiber-based solutions. How do the data capabilities support their environmental, social and governance (ESG) processes?“With our old and fragmented systems, wider scale data collection was not possible. With data lake and Power BI, we were able to get the basics in place. However, with Stella program and main business platform renewal, we can build even better capabilities for traceability, sustainability management, and data usage,” Lammila describes.“It is clear that good master data is an essential part of company management. Otherwise, process execution and new systems are not effective.”One key factor in achieving success has been the solid team of professionals working with Lammila.“My IT dream team is the one I have now. The people in the team have versatile experience in both technologies and industries, and they understand matters outside IT”, she said in a news article after she had been named the CIO of the Year. “My team includes our external partners without whom we would not have been able to transform Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s IT over the years and thus fulfill the expectations set for us to enable company transformation.”Kristiina Lammila is the CIO at Ahlstrom-Munksjö, one of the world's leading players in sustainable and innovative fiber-based solutions.

A helping hand for HCM Cloud project: customer side roles staffing,/en/blog/2020/05/a-helping-hand-for-hcm-cloud-project-customer-side-roles-staffing/,Cloud / Mira Mäkirinta / 4.5.2022,"Once you start to plan an HCM implementation project, it’s a wise to clear some resourcing related questions out. Do the people participating in the project have other parallel responsibilities? Are there areas in the project that would benefit from outside expertise? Has your project already started, the pace is increasing, project workers are more than fully booked and getting exhausted and perhaps in some areas you are already falling behind the schedule? If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, it might be a perfect time to call in some help.Three customer side roles I have covered in HCM projectsI have had the privilege to help in customer side roles during our customers' Workday projects. Let me introduce you three important roles I have covered.1. Test ManagerAs a test manager I created a test strategy for the project and more detailed test plans for each phase including both functional and integration testing. My existing knowledge from both testing and Workday methodology gave a good starting point for this work.I also gave guidance on how to create test scenarios, monitored the scenario creation, planned how to use the test system, and trained the testers to use it. I followed up on the testing progress and helped mitigate issues when needed.I feel that the project members appreciated that I was able to offer concrete help in the detailed test scenario creation as well as guide in Workday usage during the testing because Workday was already familiar to me.2. Payroll Integrations CoordinatorIn another Workday project I was called in to help when the integrations build was starting to fall behind the schedule. My role as a payroll integrations coordinator was to help to get things on track, start keeping regular status meetings and agreeing on next steps, plan integration testing activities, follow the testing progress, and finally compile the cut-over activities for each integration, and follow the actions until each integration was in production.In addition to regular weekly follow-up meetings I facilitated several onsite workshops and testing days/weeks where we, together with an integration lead, testers, a third party responsible and an integration consultant, went through questions and issues raised from testing to catch up the implementation schedule.3. HCM Core Stream LeadMy third customer side role in a Workday project was an HCM core stream lead. Because I was already familiar with the Workday HCM Core functionalities I could concentrate on making sure that the customer-specific requirements were taken into consideration. I worked closely with the customer’s HR process owner to make sure that the decisions done during the project were in line with the internal requirements.Because I knew the system already, I felt that I was able to bring extra value for the project in creating the test scenarios, leading and giving support for the stream testers, supporting integration testing and planning the data catch up activities.When the project go-live approached, I started to work closely with the person who took over the HCM Core stream lead responsibility after the go-live. During these couple of months, we started solving issues and small development requests together while sharing my Workday and project knowledge.HCM project is a joint venture!Finally, I want to make one thing very clear, I would not have been able to succeed in my role without the excellent collaboration with the customer team. The most vital thing in getting the work done is co-operation with the customer side stakeholders: project manager, stream leads, HR process owners, integration owners/leads, project members, testers, third-party project providers, and integration system vendors.

Cash Pooling – cracking the liquidity puzzle,/en/blog/2022/05/cash-pooling-cracking-the-liquidity-puzzle/,Digitalization / Torill H.  Larsen  / 2.5.2022,"A trend for many corporate treasuries has been to increase their cash reserves to hedge against future economic and political uncertainty. This allows them to ensure they have enough cash for day-to-day operations but also puts them in a good place to deliver future growth.An Investec commissioned survey found that 58% of corporates increased their cash reserves over the course of the pandemic. With global economic uncertainty increasing this trend is likely to accelerate.This is one more reason why the tools for managing liquidity continue to gain importance for corporate treasuries. On the face of it, it may seem an easy task to manage cash, but the reality is altogether different. Corporates typically deal with multiple banks, multiple accounts, multiple currencies, across multiple countries. The quantity of data is often large and supplying just the correct amount of liquidity across various parts of the organisation is a major task. Centralising the control and supply of cash is helped by banks providing consolidating tools, chief among which are Pooling and Sweeping products. A survey conducted by The Global Treasurer in partnership with Tietoevry in 2021 examined the use of the more common pooling structures that corporates expect their banks to provide.A cash pooling structure enables the corporate to group funds centrally and is a cost- and time-saving way of handling cash balances and optimise the use of the funds. What pooling method can be used is often determined by local country regulations and tax regimes. So, for example while Notional Pooling is acceptable and widely used in the U.K. it may not be permitted (due to regulations) in other countries where a corporate may operate.  So it might be that a corporate needs to use different pooling methods depending on where they are located.  Furthermore, cultural preferences may impact the choice as the level of centralization differs across corporations.  According to our survey, 1 in 2 multi-national corporations indeed apply two or more pooling methods.While the number of pooling options represents choice for corporates, it means that banks need to ensure they have the infrastructure to support the different methods. This becomes even more complicated for banks whose clients operate in multiple countries. The requirements may include the possibility of combining different methods such as notional pooling and sweeping together in one structure. In addition, corporate clients may need to connect a pool with accounts held with other banks, choose from different interest calculation models, or build several account tiers to cater for their treasury structure.Given the elements of having to provide multiple structures and permutations of those structures across multiple countries, current segregated and often local systems will not serve this purpose for the bank. Rather than developing cash pooling from scratch or sourcing solutions from different providers, it is more cost effective for banks to partner with one service provider who can deliver all the pooling models their clients are requesting.Tietoevry has been at the forefront of cash management development for over thirty years and has created a global platform approach to cater for various cash management methods within a single system. Such a modular approach enables banks to extend bespoke offerings to their corporate customer base regardless of geography, regulation, or cultural preference.", Torill H.

With well thought-out data management practices, it can be avoided.Do you know your data?Before decommissioning legacy systems and archiving the data in a traditional way, or to the cloud as I suggest, any company needs to have information about their data. What types of data do we have? Where is it stored? Who owns it? Are there any personal data? How long does each data object needs to be retained? What information do users need for finding the data? Who can access the data?Gathering all information depends on the maturity of the company’s data management processes. With proper data management processes in place, it is easy to provide the information as it is documented and available.Six practical tips for conducting a data assessmentIf the opposite is the case and information of data is missing, the company needs to conduct a data assessment to find out what they want and need to archive. I recommend deep internal and external cooperation to do the analysis efficiently and learn for the future.Here are my tips:Have a dedicated person managing the assessment in the organization: Business people are particularly important for the assessment, but their everyday work does not involve going through requirements and data characteristics. Their focus usually remains in their normal daily activities and someone in the organization needs to ensure that people are available and give enough attention for the assessment.
Invite an information management or archiving consultant to facilitate and manage the data assessment: Archiving consultants are familiar with different requirements for data archiving and know what data needs to be gathered and how. They can guide companies through the analysis process and ensure a successful outcome.
Conduct the data assessment as early as possible: The sooner companies have all necessary information about the data, the better chance there is for a successful delivery project. An understanding and having information about the legacy data is essential before starting any archiving development or data migration project.
Involve business people and end-users in the assessment: Business usually owns the data and business people most likely utilize and need the data. They should have the best knowledge about data, its ownership and know the relevant archiving related search, retention, and other requirements to be considered in data archiving. Data archives will usually be built for the business.
Involve system providers’ application maintenance teams to the assessment: System providers have all technical experts to dig the relevant information about the data in legacy systems. They have the best knowledge of how the data can be exported from the system for archiving.
Involve the archive provider to the assessment: Although requirements for archiving should always be stated independently from any specific technology, it is useful to involve the archive provider into the discussions during the analysis assessment, especially when initially planning the data export and migration to the archive.What kind of archiving plans does your organization have?Me and my colleagues are happy to help you to plan your archiving strategy and offer Tietoevry Archiving as a Service for your everyday archiving needs. It is a next-generation, cloud-based enterprise-wide archiving platform based on the OpenText™ InfoArchive product, compliant archiving both structured and unstructured information.Whether actively archiving business information to reduce system loads or de-commissioning applications to stand down outdated systems, InfoArchive is the flexible and cost-efficient way to reduce IT costs and accelerate the move to cloud.

Modular Enterprise creates profound agility,/en/blog/2022/04/modular-enterprise-creates-profound-agility/,Digitalization / Janne Vihervuori / 28.4.2022,"If we can put the global issues aside for a second, there is the promise of everything digital. Data, cloud, automation, artificial intelligence, and user experience are some of the building blocks for the expected digital future. Companies need to grow faster, in more sustainable ways, facing increasing competition. How do enterprises cope with all this?Would it be possible for companies to reorganize their critical businesses in case of a crisis quickly? When a supply chain suddenly breaks, how could the business assets affected be moved or replaced to ensure business continuity? Indeed, a silver bullet for that does not exist, but could there be something for organizations to improve fundamentally?Could the business assets of an enterprise be treated as modular building blocks? It is an ambitious thought, yet a pursuable one. Is there a paradox: if organizations that boast digitality and agility fail to cope with market disturbance, are they genuinely digital and agile? In such a case, maybe the digitalization and agility are on the surface, not deeply in the structure.Enter modular enterpiseGartner coined the term ""Composable Business"" in 2020. One of its promises is having business capabilities as ""packages"", and ultimate modularity. We at Tietoevry acknowledge and favour the ambitious principles and the value proposition of composable business. To embrace the composable thinking and package the concepts we feel are of value, we created an equation of our own that combines the proven practices of postmodern and the new composable thinking into what we call “Modular Enterprise”. Composable thinking is a necessary stepping stone to becoming modular, but modularity is the end game’s target.Elements of modular enterprise1) Postmodern enterprise (also ERP)Another Gartner concept: was established already in 2014. Many large and midsize companies have at least some degree of postmodernism in their ERP design. To some, postmodern enterprise follows pace-layering, which is a concept of arranging the business IT landscape into logical layers and defining where there is mostly commodity and where customer development is preferred. We can generalise that Postmodern Enterprise stands for solid alignment of the business applications - foundations of the Business Modularity.2) Business modularityBusiness modularity is about enterprise architecture, particularly the business architecture part. The critical point here is that some new thinking is required from the business to shape its structure towards improved flexibility, resilience, and in the end, agility. In other words, an enterprise does not become modular by just having a Business Architect model the business domains into smaller chunks. What is modular, then? Answer: when the business processes within the business capabilities can be freely consumed in a composable fashion. Business modularity is perhaps the most crucial element of the modular enterprise.3) Data effectivityThis element makes or breaks a modular enterprise in conjunction with the previous one. The novel yet simple idea here is to embrace the data utilization of the business domains and capabilities within them. Business leaders and owners of business domains should be able to articulate what data is unique to their respective areas - understanding the data that gets created in a particular domain and what data is required as input from other domains are crucial. The data governance needs to take a few steps ahead: data governance principles need to be simple enough to be implemented in what we can coin as a data fabric.4) Cloud & APIsThe final element contains these two usual suspects. However, the point is not to drop some cloudy dust on top of the enterprise IT stack and use modern integration methods here and there. Cloud needs to be native to bring the total value. The particular word with APIs is ""managed."" It is one thing to utilize loosely coupled, internet-era integration technologies in various ways and one thing to manage the consumption of the APIs that provide contextual data and are cyber secure.SAP modular enterprise?The future of business IT looks ambitious and shiny, modular and agile. Can we go on and implement a modular ERP, then? Looking at my crystal ball, I can see that organizations embracing modular enterprise will outpace their competitors in their digital transformation efforts. But climbing the steps of maturity is hard work, and there are no shortcuts. The organizations that can state being modular are typically outstanding in their fundamentals.Many SAP customers are either renewing or planning to renew their ERP systems. In this sense, is S/4HANA already paving the way for modular? If the new ERP landscape design follows the solid principles of postmodern - alignment of applications - the answer is yes. For the first element, that is. My good colleague Kari Pietiläinen wrote about Headless SAP which contains valid technical principles for elements 1 and 4 of our modular equation.How to fulfil the equation of modularity for S/4HANA? The leading thought should be about business modularity: designing the landscape based on the nature and the context of the business domains. How much flexibility a business domain should have? Is it possible that the services of that business domain will be outsourced? Divested? Would it make sense to prepare for that and consider SaaS first, then complement the core with S/4HANA? Not forgetting the element nr. three, data. Do not let software vendors dictate your data models but make the data yours.In his recent blog about ""The Journey Toward a Composable Enterprise"", Martin Heinig, Head of Ventures and New Technologies at SAP writes: “In practice creating a composable enterprise is an extremely sophisticated endeavour, both from a technical and an organizational perspective.” That very much reflects the message of this blog article. The journey towards composable, modular, is not trivial. It is not random. It is not one project or one system but improving and building foundations. And, most importantly, as Martin reminds us, the organization, not just technology.", Janne Vihervuori ,Digitalization , 28.4.2022

"A journey toward an agile and DevOps way of working, culture and tools in software maintenance",/en/blog/2021/04/a-journey-toward-an-agile-and-devops-way-of-working-culture-and-tools-in-software-maintenance/,Digitalization / Mikko Lampinen  / 27.4.2022,"How do you achieve world-class software maintenance?I believe that the best and most effective way to incorporate continuous improvement into software maintenance is to take a Master-Apprentice approach.We have used the Master-Apprentice model with great results: we rotate our strongest experts from one project to the next to support maintenance teams in developing their operations.This approach has been transformative and brought forth significant advantages in implementing a DevOps culture, ways of working and tools.We’ve had especially good experiences when we’ve paired the Master-Apprentice model with an intensive three-month transformation programme.During the course of three months, our top experts analyse the situation together with the maintenance team, and they jointly agree upon the team’s competence development needs and what development activities should be carried out. Our experts then work together with the team and help them deploy a new operating model and tools – and map the way forward in terms of future development work.Fast results with automation and public cloudA recent software project transformation provides a good example of how we put the Master-Apprentice model to work through our three-month transformation programme:The system had been deployed in 2018. Due to a lack of knowledge of modern tools and platforms the system maintenance was based on outdated tools and processes, and the development and test environments were also already at the end of their lifetime.The development approach had a lot of manual steps in terms of build, testing and deployment. The development approach was also very rigid: changes were made only once in each quarter within a separate update window – during which the system could not be used.After our three-month transformation programme, the whole system was published in the cloud as code (infrastructure as code, build, test and deployment environments). All the manual steps of development had also been removed. Now, when a developer makes changes, they go through automated tests and quality gates to the customer's test environment for the customer’s acceptance testing.The team's efficiency and work motivation increased hand in hand with the decrease of manual repetitive tasks and reporting. Automation freed up a great deal of time that can now be used directly to create new functionalities. The team learned new skills, and through regular retrospectives, the team's backlog now also includes continuous improvement activities.The use of public cloud and automation also decreased the costs of development and test environments, and the release cycle of new functionalities and versions accelerated considerably.How to incorporate continuous improvement practice into software maintenance?Although the benefits of incorporating continuous improvement into software maintenance are obvious, existing practices are not always easy to change.Critical requirements for success include:You must allocate enough time for developing the way of working. Even if experts help update the team's operating methods, the system owner must also reserve a certain part of the team's working time for developing the way of working.
The maintenance team must be willing and able to learn new things. In general, this is an inbuilt quality in people working in our constantly changing industry.
You need competent support for the team. We provide the maintenance team with the best possible support from people who know the agile and DevOps models and technical tools throughout. The best way to transfer expertise to the maintenance team is to use the Master-Apprentice model.We are convinced of the effectiveness of the Master-Apprentice model and will definitely continue to use it in developing our maintenance services and teams in the future. The Master-Apprentice model is an integral part of our way of working – and whenever we take responsibility for the maintenance of new systems, the teams get the support they need right from the start.Want to stay up-to-date?Follow Mikko Lampinen on LinkedIn.We are recruiting.

Activity planning for after-school clubs – a new approach,/en/blog/2022/04/activity-planning-for-after-school-clubs/,Digitalization / Therese Bjørø / 20.4.2022,"Over the past decade, the trend has been clear: the demands on after-school club activities have increased while the number of children has grown – without there being a corresponding increase in staffing levels.[1] In other words, it is becoming increasingly difficult to meet the requirements.Linnea Lindquist, initiator of the School Leader Campaign (Skolledarupproret) and headteacher at Hammarkull School in Gothenburg, is of the opinion that “the situation in after-school clubs is now catastrophic after many years of underinvestment”.[2] At the same time, she notes that the fault does not lie primarily with the school management: “No headteacher wants to cut back on after-school clubs, but they are given no choice if they have to achieve a balanced budget.”Potential for improvementFor this reason, while waiting for the situation to improve, it is important to make the changes and efficiency improvements that are possible – as long as they do not negatively affect the organizations and their activities. The best thing, of course, would be if we could make efficiency gains and bring about positive change.Tietoevry has looked at where there is potential to make such improvements in the organizations and their activities. One area we have identified is activity planning.With a new digital solution, it is possible to make the everyday working life of educators and management run more smoothly, and at the same time put in place the conditions for increased parental involvement.Flexibility is importantWhat we consider to be important in such a solution, above all, is that you should be able to set up a number of activities and easily specify how often they should recur, for example daily, weekly or a few times a month. In other words, it should be just as simple as with one-off activities, which do not have any planned regularity.That is a basic requirement. The solution also has to be flexible in other ways. For example, it should be usable – no matter what type of activity. It should be possible to use it to plan all the activities that the different units may do, ranging from sport and creative activities to forest walks and free play.With all the activities in the system, it is possible to get an easily accessible overview of what is happening, both in the short term and long term.At the same time, we all know that conditions can change quickly, so it must be just as easy to make changes to the planning. Here too, flexibility is an important factor.Cooperation with the homeWe also believe that such a solution can generate improvements in both the day-to-day and long-term work. By integrating the activity planning into the existing Edlevo app, there will be completely new opportunities for better communication with parents about the activities at the after-school club.The value of this is clear to anyone who works at after-school clubs, but it is worth noting that cooperation with the home is also highlighted by the authorities. The Swedish National Agency for Education’s general advice on after-school clubs emphasizes the importance of cooperation with the home. “This cooperation emphasizes communication between the stakeholders,” according to the Agency.[3]The Norwegian equivalent, Utdanningsdirektoratet, states that “good cooperation lays the foundation for parents having a positive view of the SFO [after-school club].”[4] It also points out that “good information and dialogue help the SFO and the home to support each other and focus on the needs of the child.”Greater involvementIn a digital solution integrated into the app that is already used, it is then possible to send information on activity planning to parents. Parents can look at this, perhaps together with their children, and note which activities the children will be doing.For activities that have a limit on the number of participants, confirmation from the staff may be required before the child is booked to do the activity. The parent can then easily see which activities the child will be attending the next day or further ahead.The vast majority of parents say they want to be more involved in their children’s after-school club activities, and this gives them a great opportunity to do that.Everything in one placeOf course, it is also much easier for the staff to manage communication about activities in a digital environment, compared to sending papers home and hoping that they will actually reach the parents and then also be returned to the after-school club. A digital solution also makes it easy to send out reminders, either as required or as scheduled notifications.The people working at the after-school club also have all the information in one place. It is possible to see which children will be present and if any of them are away ill when it is time for the activity. Children are checked in using the same solution, so it is easy to know when everyone has arrived.It is certainly the case that staff have had to take on more responsibility and more administration, and been given more goals to achieve. At the same time, every educator wants to give their children the greatest possible attention. This is where modern digital solutions are of great use.[1] Source: https://www.lararforbundet.se/artikelsidor/larare-i-fritidshem-om-sin-arbetssituation-mer-tid-for-kvalitet-och-arbetsgladje#tre-av-fyra-har-hog-arbetsbelastning[2] Source: https://www.gp.se/debatt/det-r%C3%A5der-en-ov%C3%A4rdig-situation-p%C3%A5-fritidshemmen-1.15733130[3] Source: https://www.skolverket.se/skolutveckling/inspiration-och-stod-i-arbetet/stod-i-arbetet/koll-pa-samverkan-med-hem-och-vardnadshavare/fritidshemmets-samverkan-med-hem-och-vardnadshavare[4] Source: https://www.udir.no/utdanningslopet/sfo/stottemateriell-til-rammeplanen-for-sfo/samarbeid-i-sfo/#a161988", Therese Bjørø ,Digitalization , 20.4.2022
Data management in focus - create a data use case and put the backbone in place,/en/blog/2022/04/create-a-data-use-case-and-put-the-backbone-in-place/,Data / Ritva Aula  / 13.4.2022,"“Data management strategy needs to be in the business strategy. It adds a dimension to the business, business processes and customer, to name a few. It must be built into the business, and the CEO and board members need to talk about it,” said our webinar guest Sameli Mäenpää, Chief Data Officer at OP Financial Group.He spoke about data management strategy with our other guests, Maija Nikula, Chief Data Officer at KONE and Maria Rautavirta, Director, Data Business Unit at Ministry of Transport and Communications Finland.Nikula added that if digitalization, data or analytics is reflected in the business strategy, it is already a good sign of going to the right direction.A strategy describes what needs to be done to achieve the jointly agreed vision and business goals. Digitalization and data-driven decision making depend on the availability of specific data content and capabilities.If the top-level engagement with data is missing, it can lead to business problems and lack of innovation. An example is the European digital single market strategy. It will give better access for consumers and businesses to digital goods and services across Europe, create the right conditions and a level playing field for digital networks and innovative services to flourish, and maximize the growth potential of the digital economy.“If one factor from data, business and strategy is zero, the product is zero. Previously, we had no vision and strategy for the digital single market and did not accomplish the goals. Now we have strong steering, and the head of states discuss data,” said Rautavirta.Putting the backbone in place takes some timeOver the years, Tietoevry’s Aula worked in various businesses and realized how difficult it often was to talk about data with business people. The focus was on applications instead of meaning. So, what advice did our guests give on how to convince the management that data needs to be taken seriously?Mäenpää advised to create a use case with real value for customer experience worth millions of euros and build a compelling story of it.“The management does not care about 1,000 euros here and there, but about a real impact on the customer experience and real value for the business.” Nikula added that one needs to back up that with a backbone.“You must put a backbone in place meaning data structure, data quality and technologies. It will take a surprisingly long time,” said Nikula.“Once we have built the backbone, we must improve it continuously. It will never be ready. The world will change, and you need to adapt.”Nikula also highlighted that everybody must understand their responsibility with data and that requires data literacy across the organization. Many questions need to be answered depending on the position. What data should we collect? How should we collect it – can we automate it? Do we need to validate the data? What kind of practices do we have around the data?Smart city development for seamless experiencesWhen building the basis for data in business strategy, one should aim at joining ecosystems. Sharing and utilizing the data is the source of innovation.Mäenpää said that banking is about helping people to achieve something in many value chains. This means that a bank needs to cooperate with other players and exchange data to develop seamless customer experiences.Rautavirta brought up another example, the smart city development, where many areas come together – the health, transport, housing, built environment to name a few.“The data really needs to flow, go across businesses and the public sector to make it possible. The resources should be used efficiently,” said Rautavirta.She encouraged organizations to join the ecosystems funded by the EU (European Union), because being part of the standardization work ensures that the organization will most likely do business also in future.Watch the Business X Data X Strategy webinar!Executives from Tietoevry, KONE, OP and LVM share their insights on data strategy and how to implement it.", Ritva Aula  ,Data , 13.4.2022

You not only have the challenge of getting support but there is also a significant risk of jeopardizing access to the data or even losing crucial business data if the system stops working. A common business case is to get cost savings and reduce the risks by decommissioning a legacy system while still providing access to important data.When legacy systems come to end of their lifecycle, there is usually still a large amount of business data in the applications, and they cannot be ramped down just like that. Organizations always need to consider the importance of the data and what to do with it now that it is most likely located in the legacy application’s databases and file systems.To keep data and to what extent?This boils down to choosing one of the following options:Maintaining the legacy system and keeping it running or hibernating.
Migrating all data to a new system replacing the old legacy system.
Archiving all data to an archive system.
Migrating only the relevant data to a new system, archiving data that needs to be retained for regulatory and business reasons and getting rid of everything else.Organizations commonly tend to choose one of the first two options, but in most cases, this will introduce additional costs the organization does not want to pay. Continuing the maintenance of a legacy system is always risky and maintenance costs can be high compared to alternative options.Migrating all data to a new system is a challenging task as the legacy data might not fit into the new data model. Transforming massive amounts of data during the data migration imposes a risk of data getting corrupted and might also require a lot of manual effort for making data to be compliant with the new data model. Archiving all data is an option if data is no longer requested often enough, or if there is no need to access the data anymore.Migrate and archive only the relevant dataWhen considering these options, there are clear and tangible benefits for an organization to migrate and archive only the relevant data:Compliance with laws and regulatory requirements – Archiving data according to requirements will ensure your organization is compliant with applicable regulations and the law. The organization retains only the data it is allowed to retain, and the archiving system will ensure the data will remain accessible, readable and secure throughout the whole retention period.Improved performance of operative systems – Having useless data in the operative system, or data that is not needed will increase the footprint of operative systems databases and file systems. Every data sensitive operation in the operative system such as searching and backups will become much slower as the application needs to browse through the data when executing the operations.Reduced costs – Less time spent maintaining and managing software and infrastructure and moving ‘inactive’ data from a costly, high-performing primary storage to a more affordable, low-performance storage. It will also bring huge savings to the organization.Improved data management – Data management processes never want to manage any unnecessary data. By getting rid of data that is no longer needed, you simplify the process of managing data in the organization.What kind of archiving plans does your organization have?We are happy to help you to plan your archiving strategy and provide Tietoevry Archiving as a Service. It is a next-generation, cloud-based enterprise-wide archiving platform based on the OpenText™ InfoArchive product, compliant archiving both structured and unstructured information.Whether actively archiving business information to reduce system loads or de-commissioning applications to stand down outdated systems, InfoArchive is the flexible and cost-efficient way to reduce IT costs and accelerate the move to cloud.

How to identify a good data strategy
How to build a data strategyWhat is the purpose of a strategy?A strategy is a plan to achieve a desired goal. A well-crafted strategy answers the question “How?” and describes what needs to be done to achieve the jointly agreed goals and visions.Every year company management works hard to sharpen their strategy, yet the staff often sees the result only as a compact PowerPoint presentation decorated with catchy images and slogans. The real need for change, and the means to implement that change, often remain a mystery.Despite this challenge, strategy does have an important role in data-driven business. It ensures a shared understanding of the goals and commitment of top management. It also outlines the first steps and an initial roadmap to move forward, as well as how to monitor and support the execution of the strategy.""Strategy has an important role in data-driven business.""Why is data strategy so important today?Data has become an increasingly important asset for companies. People rarely knock on the door of a colleague, customer, or supplier, nor do they often send mail by post. A modern business communicates through systems, applications, and digital services, and it is data that provides answers to questions like what, when, who, how, why, and what if?The higher the quality of its prioritized data, the better and more efficiently a company will operate. Time is not wasted searching for information, and decisions are based on facts instead of on guesswork or gut feeling. The company that can generate valuable insights from their data in the fastest, most effective, and most cost-efficient way will win. A winning data strategy focuses on streamlined information (both data and analytics management) and production processes to support effective decision making.In real life, data-driven operations may still be a distant dream for many companies. In recent years the massive development of data and analytics technology and the increased availability of alternative data sources (e.g., IoT, sensors, geospatial, 5G) has created almost unlimited opportunities in analytics. Unfortunately, these hyped opportunities often remain unrealized and new initiatives are abandoned after the first proofs of concept. One of the typical reasons is that the data is not fit for the intended purpose, and that is often due to lack of basic data management capabilities proactively ensuring that the data gathered meets the necessary quality requirements.Beyond ensuring data quality, completely different types of expertise are needed for data security, privacy, the ethical use of data, and the insights generated from it. These areas need to be skillfully managed in order to minimize financial and reputational risks.This is why companies desperately need a data strategy. A good data strategy takes analytics into consideration, including use cases that have the maximum effect on the business. It also takes data management into consideration, outlining how to make data available efficiently for these purposes, and takes security, privacy, and ethical requirements into account by design.Want to speak the language? Use our data glossary to master data terminologyDoes your company already have a data strategy? How good is it?There is a need to specify different strategies for different purposes – and all of these should be driven by the business vision and strategy to ensure effectiveness. It is critical to clarify and describe how the business vision and strategy are dependent on data, its usage, and management, and to create a separate sub-vision and strategy for data.Almost all companies have a business strategy guiding their core business, and most companies have an IT strategy and even a digitalization strategy. These define which digital services or automation initiatives support the business in achieving the objectives defined in the business strategy and how they are to be implemented.Some companies have already developed a data analytics strategy that sets out how data is used and for what purpose, and what kind of data products are monetized. However, only a few companies have a data strategy or data management strategy – a shared view on how data can be best prepared for the benefit of the entire organization, ecosystem, customers, and other stakeholders.Effective use of data requires that it is accessible, understandable, and fit for purpose. A good data strategy addresses all these aspects in a balanced manner and is based on conscious prioritization of which data content is most valuable, to whom, and why, and how the data is consumed and managed. Common sense tells us that it is impossible to excel in analytics in an agile, scalable, cost-effective, secure, and quick way if the data is not efficiently managed in such a way that it is ready for consumption.In order for the company to become data driven, the whole organization needs to start thinking of data as a strategic asset and become more data-centric. Increasing the importance of the business meaning of data and starting to make joint decisions on data´s business content, structures, quality, and architecture is a good start. The strategy should insist that the participants of each critical data and analytics value chain are identified and officially mandated, and that they gather for data-centric decision-making on a regular basis – this is called data governance.Further reading: What is data governance and what if it did not exist?A data strategy requires support from top management to become realityData management and analytics are not rocket science. However, achieving data-centricity changes the company culture and thus requires a systematic increase in data awareness as well as a change in the operating model and processes. This means educating staff, managing transformation, and most importantly gaining highly visible support for data-centricity from top management.Many organizations would benefit from having an in-depth understanding of data and methodology in their top strategic management. Some such experts have already been appointed, and companies worldwide are increasingly appointing chief data officers (CDOs). This trend began in the financial services sector where, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, it became mandatory to focus on data issues. Now other industries are following this lead due to their increased focus on analytics (AI/ML), data platforms, and a digitalization agenda.Regardless of the title of the position, data management should be the responsibility of a dedicated senior executive, not an additional responsibility for a chief technology officer, for example. A fully committed sponsor from top management is required in order to take responsibility for data management and analytics at the enterprise level. By facilitating and creating a good data strategy, the sponsor ensures that colleagues in the company’s management team buy into the idea. The entire management understands that data affects all operations of the company, making it necessary to collaborate and create common practices across business divisions and functions.Without the support of top management, companies’ “data debt” will continue to increase, resulting in increased costs, agility becoming rigidity, and increased risks. Often, a data-related incentive and measurement system is needed to truly implement change throughout the entire organization.It is good to acknowledge upfront as a risk that it will most likely be very challenging to get management and organizations to support data-related improvements, especially if those improvements benefit functions and business units other than their own. This is a very normal situation and is caused by silos that naturally start growing around groups of people with different objectives and incentives.Therefore, the most important purpose of a data strategy is to get senior management to “see the light” and commit to the implementation of a common data agenda across functional silos. At best it leads to a roadmap showing a common prioritization of data initiatives to achieve the goals set out in the data vision and strategy. A data strategy is meant to be a living document that is regularly revisited to ensure it is aligned with the company´s other strategic objectives. It contains both fast results making business happy and hungry, but also persistent activities to improve the ability to manage data.Further reading: OP's Chief Data Officer Sameli Mäenpää explains the role data plays in Finland's largest banking group and why information is the organization's most valuable capital.How to get started with creating a data strategyTip 1: Remember to outline the clear and visible link to your organization´s business vision and strategy, keeping that connection in mind during the whole process of creating and implementing the data strategy.Tip 2: Take your organization’s maturity to understand (data literacy) and manage data into account; it is typical to find that these skills are scarce. It is also well known that experienced business-oriented data experts are a scarce resource, which means there is a need to proactively invest in developing the data skills of your own staff – from top management right down to the individual employee level. Luckily data management is not rocket science – your current organization is capable of learning what is required if it is set as a common goal. Creating a data strategy is a good starting point for this process too.Six steps to creating your data strategy1. Analyze the current stateStart by measuring the maturity and analyzing the current state of data management. This helps you to form an understanding of the company’s position on the way towards a more data-centric and data-driven operating model and way of working, and where to start. At this point, you should start looking for members for the company’s “data tribe”. They will be the agents for transformation.2. Clarify the vision, mission, and business benefitsClarifying the vision and mission means making sure that your data vision and strategy are derived from the business vision and strategy, and discussing what it will be like when data management and analytics competence are at an adequate level. This helps you to identify how your organization can leverage data to improve its business or streamline operations to reduce costs and save time.3. Define the governance modelThe governance model defines the decision-making process, how funding is obtained, and how progress is monitored. Try to identify existing forums that can add data-related decisions to their agenda. However, pay attention that the participants of such forums are the right ones to discuss data matters.Change does not happen without someone being made accountable for it, so consider appointing a chief data officer or chief data & analytics officer to take on this responsibility.Use the existing data management frameworks as leverage, such as EDM Council’s DCAM and DAMA’s DMBOK 2.0. Ready-made frameworks can be used to identify the requirements for efficient data use and management, as well as to identify and outline the important areas for the roadmap.4. Choose technologies based on needs, considering your company’s maturity levelImplement the most essential data management technologies into the roadmap at an early stage, but not without first analyzing what your company needs and is able to take into use. Too often, applications are not used to the fullest either because there wasn’t a real business need for them in the first place or because the business was yet to recognize the need.There are some applications that will most likely be essential for the implementation of your data strategy: applications for metadata management and cataloging, master data management, and data quality management for basic data management. Depending on the organization, data sharing consisting of, for example, API management, virtualization, and data platforms including data lakes and data warehouses, may be fundamental. At the early stages, tools for analysis and visualization will most likely be required too.5. Create the roadmap and indicate the initial costsCreate a high-level roadmap that describes the largest building blocks. Make sure it includes both outputs that generate fast, direct business benefits (effectiveness) and a systematic plan to build a foundation for the longer term (efficiency).  Ensure you take advantage of the initiatives, projects, and proofs of concept that have already been carried out or planned. There is usually a lot to be re-used even if, for one reason or another, the work might have served only a small team or may not have even been completed.6. Describe the risks of not focusing on data and its managementWhat happens if nothing is done to improve data management? This scenario usually surprises the company’s management if they haven’t thought about business in terms of data before. Financial, operational, and reputational risks are likely to arise if data and its management are not properly addressed and made part of the business’s everyday agenda.Does your business need a data strategy?If you need to get your data in order swiftly, please contact us.

Data sovereignty and opportunities in the data economy,/en/blog/2022/04/data-sovereignty-and-opportunities-in-the-data-economy/,Cloud / Wenche Karlstad / 11.4.2022,"Solutions are now being worked on that can make it easier to exploit a larger share of the data. Unlike many other resources, data is an inexhaustible resource that can be reused indefinitely. For many industries, there is a large hidden value in this.The reason that so much data has never been used is complex. One aspect is that the technology extracting the value from the data material has not been properly utilized. Another is that laws and regulations for storing and transferring data are changing.These are things that most industries have to deal with. Whether you’re running a small online store with customer data or are working in a multinational group, access to cloud-stored data is increasingly important.Download a whitepaper about digital sovereignty!A solution to the Privacy Shield tangleThe Schrems II ruling from July 2020 meant that the ""Privacy Shield"" was no longer valid as a transfer basis for personal data between European and US authorities. This reinforced the need for digital sovereignty over data and cloud services.The most affected sectors and industries were those that are the most regulated; specifically the public sector, health and finance. But in practice, the ruling affected all businesses that are subject to GDPR and other regulations.Digital sovereignty is about the right to own data, where it is stored, and who has control over it. Although this presents challenges, it also offers many opportunities.A statement in March 2022 from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and US President Joe Biden suggests that a solution to the legal tangle may be found.The pair announced that the US and the EU had in principle reached an agreement on a new transatlantic data-flow regulation. The updated Privacy Shield agreement is in progress and should become a reality soon.There are also other efforts being made to strengthen Europe's position on the data front. For example, the European Commission's Data Act is an initiative launched on 28 February (2022) that is now out for consultation.EUR 270 billion in increased GDP by 2028The aim of the Data Act is to make more data available, and to regulate its access and use in both the public and private sectors. The Act also aims to stimulate increased competition through data-driven innovation.The new rules are expected to generate EUR 270 billion in increased GDP by 2028.The proposed new regulations also include criteria around how cloud services deliver their computing and storage capacities based on how the data economy is built.For example, the increased use of devices with IoT (Internet of Things) services will generate an increased amount of data over a relatively short period of time. In smart homes or smart offices, multiple devices can be connected on the same infrastructure to regulate light and heat based on predictive data using AI.Another aspect of the new regulation is aimed at improving the conditions for businesses and consumers to consume cloud services.The Data Act facilitates fairer and more open competition between SMEs and larger players. It will be easier to switch between different service providers, thanks to a reduction in the restrictions on exchanging and utilizing data between sectors. At the same time, we should be able to have confidence that the data is handled in a prudent manner.Gaia-X membershipTietoevry recently joined Gaia-X, a European partnership aimed at creating a unified ecosystem of cloud and data services under European law. Since its establishment in mid-2021, the alliance has grown to well over 300 members and more are joining all the time.The idea is that a common digital ecosystem self-regulated by its members – with open-source principles – will stimulate sharing and growth in a broad environment.The innovation potential is huge, but complex regulations have hindered small players in particular. By simplifying and building good standards for exchanging data, it can be easier to utilize a larger share of the amount of data available.Increased innovation, smarter collaborationCloser cooperation between European cloud providers, together with the Data Act, could also strengthen Europe's importance in a field where US and Chinese players have become increasingly dominant.For those who own and process large amounts of data, agility and transparency are important. By promoting new, common solutions, we can make it easier to use the data in new ways. In particular, smaller players will benefit from shortening the path from innovation to new services.Small- and medium-sized enterprises often need external expertise when harvesting the benefits of the data ocean. Gaia-X, the Data act and a new Privacy Shield agreement can contribute to smarter collaboration, greater flexibility, and faster restructuring.The easier it is to get different systems to talk, the lower the threshold for developing and adopting new solutions. The opportunity space is huge, whether it's in trade, industry, agriculture, or research – just to name a few. The technology is constantly evolving, and with it, the value of the data will only increase.Whether a public, hybrid, or private cloud system, data must be safeguarded in the right place and in the right cloud service. The following principles can help to make the correct choices for safeguarding the increased amount of data:The right level of security around your personal and critical industrial data
Scalable services to adjust the need for additional capacity over short periods. For example, increasing the availability of data during deadlines to file online tax returns, or during sales campaign periods like “Black Friday”
Stable infrastructure with high uptime and availability of basic services, ensuring safe operation of large amounts of data
Speed that provides rapid development from idea to production, in order to stimulate increased innovation of new products and services with agile operational models
Savings from the effect of scalable services and automation, as well as from a reduction of the total cost of ownership with own local datacenter
Sustainable solutions in data centers and offices with green energy; circular use of hardware as some of the important valuesTietoevry is experiencing an increasing demand for sovereign clouds that can ensure the needs of Nordic organizations and meet legal requirements.

Essential role of payment systems in the payments contingency,/en/blog/2022/04/new-pageessential-role-of-payment-systems-in-the-payments-contingency/,Cybersecurity insights / Deniss Filipovs / 7.4.2022,"Clearing and settlement infrastructures operated by the central banks are the cornerstone of national payment systems. Payments have evolved rapidly during the last decade, throwing central banks and other payments system operators difficult challenges to overcome.While bank or retailer specific issues would impact a very limited number of users of payments services, payment systems, in turn, are crucial to the functioning of the national financial system and would have a systemic impact on the economy of the country and its population.Payments have undergone a fundamental transformation towards standardization, centralization, and globalization. Centralized and simply bigger infrastructures are naturally better positioned to address the growing customer demands and stay competitive to the private initiatives driven by BigTech. At the same time, payment systems need to be cost-efficient.Growing dominance of global players and cross-regional infrastructures has raised concerns about the independency and autonomy of the national payment system, as well as the ability to ensure that this systemically important business continues in the event of operational problems.When something goes wrongWhile many like to speculate, that any contingency policy is powerless in power outages, there are many of risks that can materialize and disrupt payment operations. Yet the likelihood of a complete country-wide blackout in Europe is extremely low.The number of non-cash payments is constantly growing, and Covid-19 pandemic has strengthened the trend. The shift is also addressed by the modern contingency regulations and provisions that do not follow the approach ensuring access to cash, but rather ensure a certain level of availability of payments. While banks are obliged to have contingency plans in place to be able to fulfil the requirements, ability to use clearing and settlement services is not fully in their control.Struggles that pay off for BalticsLocal systems are becoming more dependent on European or global infrastructures and even “outsourced”. Nevertheless, some of the Nordic-Baltic countries are still operating their own systems. Those central banks are used to put a substantial effort to ensure that infrastructures can remain competitive and efficient.Good examples here are retail payment systems EKS, operated by the Bank of Latvia, and Centrolink owned by the Bank of Lithuania. While the latter has successfully found a new category of market players to focus on, Bank of Latvia has been among leaders in the Euro area in driving the development of instant payments and related value-added services during last years. In 2017, Latvia was the first country in the Euro area to process instant payments in accordance with the SCT Inst rulebook. A few years later, they introduced a proxy service, which is used by the top Latvian and Estonian banks and has recently delivered a request-to-pay service to the Baltic market.Ownership over national infrastructures provide central banks and national authorities a higher level of flexibility and control in business continuity and contingency. Such a setup allows authorities to develop more efficient contingency procedures, where requirements can be translated into comprehensive strategy – to focus on the contingency of the core infrastructures, where banks would build their tactics as alternative connection to the national infrastructure even if they are not participating in it. Thus, national systems allow countries to keep control of the contingency strategy and have procedures for the domestic clearing of credit transfers or card payments as the main part of the business continuity plan.Options availableFor countries that rely on foreign systems, the objective of a greater confidence and control of the national payments contingency strategy may seem to be unattainable.The current preferences of banks towards central bank services are mainly commercially driven since banks can freely choose if they want to participate in the central bank systems.National authorities aiming to ensure reasonable and realistic contingency measures could define requirements for a back-up connectivity to the local clearing and settlement mechanisms and claim central banks the liability to provide a functional back-up payment facility if it is not there.Local implementation of the secondary facility for a clearing and settlement mechanism would deliver an essential building block for the payments contingency plan of the national economy. It would enable local clearing and settlement of card payments and credit transfers being so crucial for financial stability.Wish to share your thoughts?

“Use as easy tools as you can” – ICA Gruppen has a shared data toolbox but distributed project ownership,/en/blog/2022/04/ica-gruppen-has-a-shared-data-toolbox-but-distributed-project-ownership/,Data / Data  Insiders / 7.4.2022,"ICA Gruppen’s operating businesses range from grocery retail to pharmacy and from financial services to real estate. How does their group-level data team support the business lines with their varying needs while the cross-company functions – such as the loyalty program – play a remarkable role?The latest Data Insiders podcast took a deep dive on the topic.“We have quite a wide toolbox,” says Olof Granberg, Director of Data and Advanced Analytics Technology at ICA Gruppen. “And we have to be smart on what tools to use. In some cases, we get a request for a new machine learning model to do something – say, to predict the assortment. You may really need a new machine learning model to do that. But sometimes, it’s just about getting the right data in the right place and having a dashboard with a good user experience rather than building a new AI model. It’s always good to use the easiest solution possible to each problem.”The abundant but sensitive customer data“If you look at ICA from the outside, it would be extremely easy just to say ‘let’s just pull all of the data from all of the companies into one place, and form a picture of the customer,” Granberg illustrates.But there are weighty reasons for a more granular approach. Firstly, the data collected from different kinds of business – like banking activities and grocery shopping – is not always consistent. Secondly, the business lines may operate under different regulations, regarding privacy and data protection. And last but not least: all data use activities, and their benefits must be crystal clear to consumers. After all, ICA Gruppen’s vision is to make every day a little easier.“The technical side of pulling data from several sources is not the biggest challenge these days. It’s more about how we work with the data.”On a journey to make data governance a natural part of the businessThere’s one thing over the others that Granberg emphasized when he visited the Data Insiders podcast: “Even though you centralize a data team and resources, you cannot isolate that from the business. The business use cases need to be run by the business, where also the delivery side is.”Granberg also shared his tips on linking data government and business development together. In a nutshell, the steps are as follows:Map out the whole data management organization and processes. Who are the information owners? Who works actively with data now?
Create a company-level data strategy. How do you want to work with the whole lifecycle of data? Expand the view from the mere analytics use.
Avoid the trap of putting everything on IT – start pushing data management into the business.
When you look for new data owners, make sure to find the people who have the time to dig into numbers and use cases. They need to be on a high enough level to make decisions – but they also need sufficient hours for their new role.ICA Gruppen is on the journey right now, bringing data closer to businesses. “Data governance isn’t a side quest. It should be part of natural business development,” says Granberg.Olof Granberg works as Director of Data and Advanced Analytics Technology at ICA Gruppen AB, a leading retail company in the Nordic market.

How to Navigate the Fintech Forest,/en/blog/2022/04/how-to-navigate-the-fintech-forest/,Data / Gard Heiaas / 5.4.2022,"As easy as it was to buy a Tesla, sitting on the couch at home with the iPad, in 2013. As a pioneer in the electric car market, Tesla had the privilege of setting a standard, which the consumer quickly ""bought into"". Easy to buy, easy to drive, own and charge.Since 2013, the complexity of the electric car market has grown exponentially. We are talking about different Apps, suppliers, charging points, charging lines and where can you find these charging points geographically? Is there cross-border co-operation with the same solutions and standards, or do you have to learn new solutions in new Nordic countries.This type of development has taken place in several areas, including the payment market. New regulation has produced an almost frantic pace of innovation and new solutions - all with the aim of simplifying and improving - but has it become easier? For consumers, much has been simplified, yet they have far more options.Is this also the case for companies? Maybe not. Orienting oneself in the ""fintech forest"" that has emerged requires one's own map and compass. New challengers are fighting for a place in the ecosystem that was previously completely controlled by the banking sector, and it is easy to be misled. Spending resources on the wrong solution can be costly in the form of poor customer experiences and customer losses. At the same time, it requires considerable effort to get acquainted with everything that happens. Not only what is available now, but also what comes ahead and what customers' expectations are. The driving force for the consumer is often convenience, they want to use services of their choice because it is smooth and easy.New non-financial players are attacking attractive parts of the banks' value chain and challenging in completely new ways.

Changing times in manufacturing,/en/blog/2022/04/servitization--changing-times-in-manufacturing/,Digitalization / Rory Moore / 1.4.2022,"There is a pervasive expectation today that by making certain digital investments (IIoT platforms, machine connectivity, digital customer portals and so on) will directly yield new and improved service revenue streams via new portfolio offerings. The reality is that very few machinery and equipment manufacturers have successfully made the shift from Foundational Service revenue streams (field service, repairs, spares etc.) to Advanced Service revenue streams (performance and outcome services).This is a very common challenge – a sticking point for business leaders as they ask “how do we monetize digital capital investments and build profitable revenue streams from Advanced and Digital service offerings? Most of the learning curve over the past decade in manufacturing has focused on choosing technology, platforms and data capabilities.Now, there is a strong consensus that this approach is putting the cart before the horse. You need to first identify what you want to sell and how you will sell it before you can develop the service offering capabilities (platforms, data, digital etc.). It’s time for a new approach, and one that is linked firmly in the reality of service business growth today. Here’s a look at the basic rules to follow and how Tietoevry can help you chart the course for service transformation success.In this article you will learn:


How to determine your readiness for service-driven business growth


Ways of implementing change that enhances your aftermarket business


How to take a stepwise approach toward expanding your service portfolio


How to tackle stumbling blocks in the service transformation journey


Why you need strategic advice to make technology and digital implementation successfulThe services revolution in manufacturingFor centuries, traditional manufacturing has been the backbone of industrial development – but with the advent of technology and digitalization, things have changed. Today, we see how the focus on selling capital equipment is rapidly shifting towards a service-based operational model (Servitization) and the trend is destined to accelerate even faster in the years ahead.Indeed, in many manufacturing companies, traditional service-based operations are already well established and account for major shares of revenue and margin. But are they sustainable in the long term? That’s a question business leaders are trying to answer. The shift to future proof and digitally powered business models for servitzation brings a set of new and unique challenges to the transformation table.In response to this rapidly changing marketplace, decision makers face four main tasks. They need to:Ensure that current service business is capitalized and profitable for as long as there is a demand for foundational offerings
Develop new service-based business models that enable stable and profitable growth
Ensure that these new services are in line with changing service market demands
Leverage valuable service data assets in a way that meets and exceeds customer expectationsPrerequisites for your Servitization journeyAll Servitization journeys have two key considerations:Full integration of all service delivery capabilities and eradication of business and data silos
Your new advanced service offerings should have a carefully designed roadmap for implementation in line with your service customers’ expectations.Both of these considerations are obvious and easy to identify. However, they require careful planning and strategic roadmaps for both the implementation of new services and ways of working as well the digital capabilities needed. In Tietoevry’s experience, the most common challenges and the strategic prerequisites in all transformation planning include:Challenge: The vision for developing a service-based business model may not be shared by all stakeholders. Quite often there are different opinions on the objective, the way the new system should be organized, and also the expected outcomesSolution: A well defined and iterative Servitization Roadmap that accounts for the business models change is required.





Challenge: When it comes to the data assets that service-based offerings require, these may not be readily accessible. More often than not, service data assets are contained in silos at individual business units or service centers that are not connected and use different systems for documentation and other vital information.Solution: Data silos need to be removed and a common approach to service data governance is needed.





Challenge: Your customers’ maturity levels and expectations differ from region to region. This means that your service business will need to be agile enough to deliver both traditional and advanced services in parallel, not to mention the growing demand for outcome-driven services too.Solution: A well-defined Service portfolio of offerings mapped according to different market expectations and supported with the necessary digital infrastructure and tooling is key to success.", Rory Moore ,Digitalization , 1.4.2022

Sustainability: why the card business must act,/en/blog/2022/03/sustainability-why-the-card-business-must-act/,Digitalization / Hans Sjölund / 31.3.2022,"Whether it’s global warming, resource depletion or the rapid exclusion of populations and communities from resources, our planet is in crisis. In our new white paper, we outline the pressures on our sector from non-governmental organisations (NGOs), governments and consumers themselves to take action. We also explain what can be done to make card payments more sustainable.While much of the focus in payments has been on energy used by crypto, one estimate published on Medium by HackerNoon claims[1] the card industry consumes four times more energy than cryptocurrencies once ATMs and POS terminals are taken into account. We believe there are several steps the card industry can take to reduce its environmental impact which have a measurable and positive effect without costing billions.Taking action to protect the environment is vital given that card use continues to grow in Europe, with technological developments such as contactless cards, biometric security and increased processing power making cards fit for purpose in the 2020s and beyond. Data from the ECB shows card use more than doubled during a seven-year period over the last decade to reach around 48 billion transactions a year on 609.3 million cards by the end of 2020[2].In Sustainable card payments: our responsibility, we explain the steps firms in the card sector should be taking, from sustainable card issuing using ocean recovered plastic, recycled PVC, recycled PETg and PLA through sustainable card management by reducing the use of paper in customer communications and minimizing the carbon footprint created by transport between production centres and customers.In a similar vein, our white paper argues for the use of sustainable energy in transaction processing, which Tietoevry undertakes at our processing centres in Norway running on 100% renewable energy, and the development of “end of life” sustainability programs for plastic cards. For instance, Tietoevry’s ongoing partnership[3] with SpareBank 1 in Norway allows customers to return their expired cards to Tietoevry as of 2022 so that precious metals used in chip and card production can be recycled and reused. Measures such as those outlined above have enabled us to reduce our environmental footprint by 56% since 2016.Other areas covered in our white paper include the importance of customer communication and engagement to your sustainability work, and the benefits that accrue to those card firms who act decisively, including improved customer loyalty and employee engagement.Click here to download your free copy of “Sustainable card payments: our responsibility” – our new white paper on sustainability in the card business.[1] See hackernoon, The Bitcoin vs Visa card fallacy: https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-bitcoin-vs-visa-electricity-consumption-fallacy-8cf194987a50[2] See European Central Bank, Card Payment Statistics: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/stats/paysec/html/ecb.pis2020~5d0ea9dfa5.en.html", Hans Sjölund ,Digitalization , 31.3.2022

Don’t leave AI project planning for engineers, onlyWhen you want AI to bring real benefits, involve the end-users from the first steps on. “You have to have a clear vision of the project and share that vision with the business professionals. They will tell if the application would work in real life.”2. Build ethics into everything you do“We don’t have separate people in our team considering ethics, but it’s built into everything,” Leminen emphasizes. It all comes back to collaboration with the hands-on professionals: they are the ones thinking “what happens next”, after the AI has done its job with data.3. Turn laws and regulations into your quality rulebookThe better you understand the background behind laws and regulation, the better you can make use of them in your projects. “We benefit from the medical device regulation quite a lot. It defines our development work and our quality criteria. We don’t take it as an add-on bureaucracy only, but as a tool and advice.”4. Strengthen networks and use resources wiselyA practical example of collaboration is HUS’s advanced data lake solution offered to other public hospitals across Finland. Furthermore, Miika Leminen is currently leading a 10 million EU project AICCELERATE. The partner hospitals across Europe develop scalable models that address data sharing, integration, privacy, and ethics.Are you interested to know more?

"Do you have a Cloud strategy, but are stuck?",/en/blog/2022/03/Do-you-have-a-Cloud-strategy-but-are-stuck/,Cloud / Martin Sveum / 20.3.2022,"Technology must support your business strategy, and the best, simplest and most effective way to ensure that technology supports your business strategy is to use cloud computing.Why does the cloud support your business strategy better than having your own server room on premise, your own hardware and your own software that is partly tailored to your company’s needs?You can find an in-depth answer below, but among other things, the cloud helps companies reduce the time it takes to launch a product or service. Cloud services support better customer experiences and customer satisfaction. And the cloud provides greater flexibility in terms of capacity, access to services and scalability.Technology is becoming increasingly important as companies enter the market with their products and services. Today, in practice, all companies have become technology companies. At the same time, technology is evolving faster and faster at an impressive rate, and most of the technological development we see today is happening in the cloud.When planning a cloud strategy, you should start by considering what the market will look like in the future and what technologies your business needs to fit into the future. Get an overview of the systems and services your business already has and consider what you need. Will there be changes in how your business delivers its products and services in the future, and will it require systems or services that are different from what you have today? Should it be built on its own data center? Is the cloud expertise in place?If you have these elements in order, you are well on your way to a good cloud strategy. Nevertheless, it must be ensured that the cloud investment is aligned with the overall business goals of the business.Cloud strategy: a platform for business strategyThe reason why cloud services are the best way for technology to support your business strategy is that you get and pay for what you need – exactly when you need it.Below, we list five good reasons why a cloud strategy adapted to your business will also support your business strategy and allow you to reach your business goals.From Capex to OpexThrough Cloud Services, IT infrastructure services are changed from capital-intensive investments in advance (Capex), to expenses that can be taken over by operations (Opex). This allows you to use the company's funds where it provides the best ROI strategically and you can link IT expenses directly to the IT services you need.SecuritySecurity has become increasingly important in an ever more digital world. The cloud gives businesses access to better security solutions, such as services tailored to your business needs. While many security solutions can be on-prem solutions, it is time consuming and complicated to set them up.ScalabilityThe coronavirus pandemic has illustrated the benefit of having a flexible and scalable IT infrastructure. Many companies and industries have had to reduce activity, while others have experienced strong growth. With the cloud, costs can be reduced in step with use, while you have instant access to additional resources as needed.AvailabilityThe coronavirus pandemic has also illustrated the advantage of having IT services and data available at all times, no matter where you are and what device you are using. Cloud services allow people and/or systems to be connected without physical boundaries.Time to marketWith the cloud, the time it takes to get services into the market is greatly reduced. With instant access to computer resources, the idea can be designed, prototyped, tested and put into production without having to wait for the IT department to order machines and software, for the supplier to have this delivered.We help large and small companies in various industries to propose the next step in their cloud journey through a standardized and well-documented framework. We can also help you, through our services within «Cloud Advisory», which you can read more about here.Download this guide on how to associate your business goals with cloud investing.", Martin Sveum ,Cloud , 20.3.2022
Six areas where cloud provides businesses large gains,/en/blog/2022/04/Six-areas-where-cloud-provides-businesses-large-gains/,Cloud / Martin Sveum / 20.3.2022,"Improve the customer experienceCloud services enable you to effectively meet the needs of your customers and users and improve the user experience. Taking care of users' needs and delivering a good user experience is the key to success for all companies, regardless of industry and market.IT solutions in the cloud make it possible to create efficient and user-oriented services, in addition to creating personalized user experiences. Use of the cloud has improved the user experience for the employees in a company, as well as provided simplified dialogue with the public.SecurityWith an increasingly digitalised world, more and more crime is moving online: business-critical information going astray, the kidnapping of data and IT systems (ransomware), data breaches, shutdown of websites (DDoS attacks) and much more. The world of cybercrime is becoming increasingly professional and increasingly difficult to stop. At the same time, IT security experts are in short supply and good IT security procedures are demanding to set up. This means that very few companies, if any, are able to properly handle IT security with their internal resources.On the other hand, cloud companies that provide Public Cloud services such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon have large security departments and some of the world’s best “white hats” – IT security experts – on the payroll.Microsoft, for example, spends enormous resources on developing market-leading security solutions, available to all Microsoft Azure users, regardless of whether you are a global group with thousands of employees or a start-up company with a handful of people.Easy collaborationThe corona pandemic has accelerated the digitalisation of cooperation, collaboration and administrative processes. Video conferencing, information and data sharing, and automation of processes are greatly simplified by the use of cloud services.Cloud services allow more people to collaborate on the same document in real time, regardless of where a person sits and which device the person uses. Cloud-based collaboration services provide the necessary security while removing barriers to information sharing between colleagues, partners and suppliers. Centralized data in the cloud provides secure access to the same information no matter where a user is located or which device is being used, as long as access rights are granted to the user in question. Centralized rights management and storage of information increases the productivity of the business while reducing costs.Innovation“New innovations happen in the cloud first.” That has been the message from all the major providers of cloud-based software and platforms. This is true for Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Google and other suppliers of software that can still be installed on-prem (meaning “on-premises”, i.e. you have physical servers and computers located on site).The cloud is where innovations, new solutions and services come first. Many – and more and more – solutions and services will not be available on traditional on-prem installations at all.To put it bluntly: if you want to take advantage of innovative IT solutions today or in the future that can boost your business, generate new revenue and improve the customer experience, your business must have a cloud strategy. Just think of the possibilities that lie in IoT (Internet of Things), AR (Augmented Reality), analytics, AI (Artificial Intelligence) and so on.More streamlined operationsBusinesses must grow, and with growth comes more processes, tasks and increased administration, as well as more customers and employees. This growth also generates more data and often the need for new systems and new IT services.Previously, this meant purchasing servers and storage systems, equipment that also required space. In addition, the equipment had to be set up and configured, which required both time and resources. Fortunately, today there are other and more efficient ways to get new IT services. By using cloud solutions such as Microsoft Azure, your business can increase storage, set up infrastructure for new business systems or add new users – all with just a few clicks. In a few short minutes, your cloud-based IT infrastructure and IT services will be up and running.Cloud also makes it easy and affordable to test new online services. You can scale up, scale down or completely remove services that are no longer in use. Since you only pay for the services you use, your IT costs will also increase or decrease at the same time.Financial gainsThrough the effects of the initiatives mentioned above, companies will achieve various financial gains. Lift of gains from using cloud services:Reduced cost with the right capacity in line with needs without the need for investment
Reduced cost by removing services when not in use
Savings by using a standardized and complete service portfolio (IoT, AI, AR ++)
Savings through shorter development time of new services (Time to market)
Savings through streamlining and reduced error rates when using coding - IaC
Gains through the use of a standardized cloud-based tool portfolio
Gains through better user experience; efficient collaboration, modern user interfaces and better security, resulting in more efficient employeesA move to the cloud can provide cost savings by moving the expense items from investments to ongoing operations. Traditional solutions and deliveries require large investments from start. In addition, there are high unpredictable operating costs and re-investment in the renewal of equipment and software.In the cloud, you pay for the services you use, when you need them. Increases the number of employees, increases operating costs in parallel without upfront investment. If the number of employees is reduced, costs are reduced accordingly. Cloud services reduce own employees' time consumption when establishing and operating IT solutions, which frees up time and capacity for strategic IT work.The cloud will give your business better liquidity.Tietoevry Connect can help you today!We help large and small companies in various industries to propose the next step in their cloud journey through a standardized and well-documented framework.

Boost customer service with cloud,/en/blog/2022/03/boost-customer-service-with-cloud/,Digitalization / Mikko Tavi / 18.3.2022,"These days, customers’ needs and expectations change rapidly, and customer experiences are often compared. The growth of digital services continues, and as much as 85% of contacts will be virtual in 2022.Customer service needs have become more versatile, and customer service consists of various components - there are numerous service channels, and customers expect to receive assistance through a channel that is the easiest for them. Genesys and Tietoevry’s customer service teams offer solutions to this kind of needs.“Genesys’s vision is to combine all essential features and services into one platform. Cloud service makes providing customer service more flexible. Services can be deployed quicker, and it is faster to develop them if necessary,” says Kari Nokkala, the Principal Solution Consultant, Genesys.Tietoevry Create has been Genesys’s partner for many years, and together we have carried out Contact Center and customer service projects for multiple clients in different industries. In addition to customer service solutions, we offer service process design, e-service implementation and customer experience consulting.Here are some of the benefits Genesys Cloud offers to its customers:Continuous development cycle
Faster deployment of innovations
Always up to date – no maintenance breaks
Lower total costs
Modern and fault-tolerant architecture
Integrated user interface for all stakeholdersThe cloud service architecture can also be scaled flexibly according to the size of the organisation. The smallest customer service organisation that uses Genesys Cloud consists of ten people, while the largest is Uber with over 25,000 customer service agents. Remote work is also a key issue when discussing cloud services. It does not matter whether the staff works from home or is based at the office.Customer success story: How quickly can a Contact Center be set up from scratch?When COVID-19 hit Finland in spring 2020, society encouraged the elderly to stay home in quarantine as they were at higher risk of the virus. The situation was exceptional, which is why Helsinki-apu was established. Via Helsinki-apu, senior citizens over 70 were able to buy food and medicine with home delivery and receive emotional and spiritual support. A Contact Center was needed.Tiina Hörkkö,Director, Helsinki-apu, talks about setting up a Contact Center from scratch in a tight schedule and exceptional circumstances. Once the co-operation with Genesys had started, the first Helsinki-apu phone calls were made in less than a week. One key aspect in the success of Helsinki-apu was that they did not only answer phone calls but also made calls.“We started off in a situation where the people being trained for the job did not even know what Contact Center was! That was the starting point for our training. Meanwhile, the actual CC was set up in three days. During this process, it took more time to train people for the job than setting up the Contact Center,” Hörkkö recalls.The project involved a great deal of work. There were numerous different contracts and commitments, equipment purchases, training and taking care of data protection agreements. According to Hörkkö, setting up the actual Contact Center was the simplest part.“I remember thanking Genesys and saying that we were quite the heroes for being able to do this in three days. Kari answered that we would not even have needed three days – we could have done it in two! This is a notable example of how quickly things can be achieved,” Hörkkö says.Cloud-native customer service solutionsMikko Tavi, Head of Customer Service at Tietoevry, says that cloud-native customer service solutions have revolutionised the world of Contact Centers.“The benefits of modern cloud-based contact centers and customer service solutions are not limited to speed and agility, but it is also easy to integrate other data sources on the services. Today, our customers emphasise cloud-native solutions and the more agile responsiveness they bring to business needs.""Tietoevry's customer service team assists with all operational planning and digitalisation projects related to customer experience, customer service and Contact Centers.

A humanist who hearts machines – what’s my code for success?,/en/blog/2021/06/a-humanist-who-hearts-machines/,Meet our people / Hennileena Calonius / 15.3.2022,"Then a coding bootcamp changed my working life for good.When I started coding it was like diving into a bottomless sea. “There is no way I can learn everything,” I thought to myself. There is always a new opportunity to deepen your knowledge around the corner – whether it’s a new coding language, framework, or technology. For many coders, me included, I think that’s part of the charm!In my first few years at Tietoevry I worked on a public sector project where I focused mainly on frontend development but also learned how to be a scrum master – a “servant leader” who holds everything together, guides the team, and makes sure they follow agile practices. Being a scrum master gave me the opportunity to work closely with the customer and the rest of the development team.Spinning my own webIn January 2021 I joined our low-code team and became certified with a platform called Outsystems; after that I began to create small web applications on my own and with the team.I find developing with low code rewarding since you basically have a working version of the application with you all the time. And since Outsystems is a visual platform that uses code-generating techniques, no code writing is needed, which means that I can spend time on creating great logic, good UX design, and durable architecture.The nature of low-code developing means that it’s fast – our team built a working mobile banking application in a matter of weeks – but it’s no silver bullet. If you’re going to build the best possible solution to meet your customer’s needs, you still need to solve the same problems that you would with a code editor.Starting low lets me aim highMy aim for the long term is to diversify my technological skills so that I’m familiar with every aspect of the software development process. Low-code platforms provide a great foundation for developing my full-stack capabilities because I can concentrate on getting to know the full scope and life cycle of the application I’m working on, instead of getting weighed down writing lines of code.I find it very useful that any individual member of the team can perform any task that the team is given, meaning the team as a whole is more effective and less vulnerable.Do you want to join me and many more talented experts?Learn more and apply here!", Hennileena Calonius ,Meet our people , 15.3.2022
Key Open RAN integration challenges,/en/blog/2022/03/key-open-ran-integration-challenges/,Cloud / Mats  Eriksson / 15.3.2022,"Mobile communications and the internet are a critical part of our society. 5G is expected to further accelerate digitalization, but to do so, 5G needs to succeed in bringing needed innovation in new services and use cases, as well as in delivering an acceptable cost structure.In my previous blog and white paper, I introduced certain aspects that will determine if Open RAN becomes a success or not: Is Open RAN the silver bullet for the wireless industry? And as integration is one of the key success factors, I’ll now dive into the full picture of Open RAN integration.Main Open RAN integration challengesSome of the key interfaces, such as the fronthaul, are extremely complex and require high performance. Performance is directly influenced by how well we succeed in integration. Building seamless integration requires cross-domain technical skills.Many seek reduced operational costs, and this calls for the integration of operation, maintenance, and network automation stacks. Here we’re dealing with how Apps running in NearRT & NonRT RIC may interfere as they implement various control-loops. Integration plays a key role also in RAN CI/CD pipelines and test automation supporting solutions and configurations. In multi-vendor Open RAN scenarios, it implies that the SW comes from a variety of vendors into the CI/CD pipeline of a specific integration.Obviously, security aspects should not be forgotten in a world where the use of open-source and the number of software vendors are both increasing.Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are forced to further consider their role and desired vendor independence in integration processes.My new white paper, Integrating Open RAN – The full picture of key Open Radio Access Networks integration challenges – outlines the understanding of different aspects of Open RAN integration.integration of the various interfaces

The importance of balancing change – meet The Cognitive Enterprise,/en/blog/2022/03/the-cognitive-enterprise--digital-transformation-in-2022/,Digitalization / Niclas Hansson / 14.3.2022,"Most of us like to believe we’re one of the former, but in all honesty, most of us are more or less reluctant to change – whether we like it or not. The Cognitive Enterprise isn’t here to change people, it’s here to help you harvesting all their potential and meet your future challenges.People are generally cautious to change. There are many reasons for this cautiousness, or skepticism, not least of all because we’re conditioned to fear the unknown. People who voice these concerns (more or less subtly) are usually labeled as hard to work with, but I disconcur; people that are reluctant to make the necessary changes have simply not been given the necessary information to understand why the change needs to come about – and that’s on you.The importance of balanceAny successful digital transformation needs to rely on three pillars humans, technology, and business. When an organization embarks on a digital transformation journey, it’s essential that all three pillars are given the same attention. Too many times, we’ve seen organizations and businesses put all their focus on technology, thinking that the business-pillar and human-pillar will follow suit as the technology is implemented. In the absolute majority of cases, this approach will fail. And in the rest of the cases, you’d have been more successful if you’d put equal emphasis on all three pillars. Technology is an essential part of the desired state that is the Cognitive Enterprise, but technology doesn’t stand on its own legs – you need to balance all three pillars to make a successful digital transformation.How to balance all three pillarsThe second wave of digitalization and Industry 4.0Firstly, I’d like to make it perfectly clear that these insights regarding how to become a Cognitive Enterprise owe thanks to our customers. Our methodology on how to become a Cognitive Enterprise comprises our customers’ challenges, struggles, and stories on what approach worked, and what didn’t work. As the Cognitive Enterprise is all about succeeding in entering the second wave of digitalization, our mission is to help others to adapt to the increasingly demanding markets and challenging circumstances of Industry 4.0. Simply put, you need to become a Cognitive Enterprise to stay agile and harvest the opportunities that lie in your data.Secondly, if you haven’t already downloaded our point of view – Why and How You Should Turn Your Organization into a Cognitive Enterprise, I strongly suggest you do so now to learn more and prepare your organization for what lies ahead.Download our point of view", Niclas Hansson ,Digitalization , 14.3.2022
Why is diversity crucial for tech?,/en/blog/2022/03/why-is-diversity-crucial-for-tech/,Sustainability / Anna Gulliksen / 14.3.2022,"The pandemic has been tough for many organizations and their employees. Layoffs, streamlined organizational goals, reduced working hours to save jobs and decreased global mental health means that many reevaluated what’s really important in their lives.For most of us, we learned to cherish the bond we have with our friends and family even more, but we also learned to appreciate our colleagues. We missed the informal chitchat, the spontaneous run-ins at the office, and being in the same room as we brainstormed new concepts and solutions. Simply put, we missed feeling like “normal”, and we often strived to do things that made things feel less unfamiliar and scary. This is fair enough – we all need coping mechanisms in place, for our own personal wellbeing as well as for our workplaces. We, as human individuals, like to be within our comfort zone, to be with and interact with people that are just like ourselves. But – what happens if, or when, we let these coping mechanisms that make us seek the known and the familiar continue to be our guiding principle? Not only do we know why we seek comfort and the familiar, but we also know why it’s unwise to always do so. In order to create innovation and develop ourselves as well as our teams, we need different perspectives, people with diverse experiences and cultural backgrounds that will accelerate the speed and quality of innovation further.Luckily for all of us, the last two years didn’t only bring with it businesses and organizations going back to basics; we saw a crisis accelerating digitalization, we saw people from a wide variety of different industries coming together to solve emerging issues quickly, and we saw people getting to know people from different parts of the world in a way they wouldn’t have if not for the pandemic. This, in turn, made my career path one of the most sought-after – Talent Acquisition. Finding the hot talent is just as hot as being the right talent, according to LinkedIn Jobs on the Rise 2022: The 10 roles that are growing in demand in Sweden. So why is Talent Acquisition becoming trickier these days?Finding the right candidateI’m happy to say that the candidate pool is becoming more diverse. However, it is still far from being able to label it “diverse”. Finding the right talent is becoming more difficult as organizations are realizing that a diverse workforce is a good and profitable workforce. We know that a world created by a homogenous group of people constitutes a world that caters to that particular group’s needs and wants. That is why, for example, car crashes are more likely to cause severe harm to others than average-sized men. It is why women are often seen shivering in offices whilst men are thriving in a temperature perfect for their performance.Everyone that knows me knows that my mission is to create diverse workplaces, driven by fair and objective recruitment (i.e. Talent Acquisition) processes. I am eager to share my tips and tricks on how to attract the right talent.", Anna Gulliksen ,Sustainability , 14.3.2022
The contingency of payments in the Nordic context – Sheltered Harbor as a potential solution,/en/blog/2022/03/contingency-of-payments-in-the-nordic-context/,Cybersecurity insights / Atte Valtanen / 14.3.2022,"The contingency of payments in the Nordic countries has already been discussed for a decade – and is more topical than ever. Losing national control over the critical infrastructure together with national interests has been the issue. This includes the banks providing services locally, clearing houses’ intermediating and central banks catering for bank-to-bank payment transmissions, which ensures that the card acquirers and issuers can use their card locally during outages. The key word here is locally.Even if payment customers are often tied to a specific country, the common denominator for all payment systems has been the ability to serve customers increasingly from abroad regardless of where they spend their time. This change has happened over many decades, and for a good reason. However, we must ask if we reached too far from home markets. Should we start investing more locally to be able to provide payment services for customers and citizens with better local resilience?Local presence is hard with dispersed operational modelsThe banks have the most at stake as they provide the longest portion of the payment value chain. Everything from payment initiation through payment execution to the point payments are exchanged with local clearing houses, banks own the value chain and capabilities. After decades of investing in the consolidation of capabilities, European infrastructures, and efforts in overall industrialization of payments landscape, they can provide the services from dispersed locations with both technology and operational staff.This benefits the customers but poses multiple points of failure from the contingency perspective. The solution for the problem is two-fold. Can the banks provide operational resiliency in all countries they operate in and ensure that the critical data is stored within the same country? So simple a question, but immensely difficult to solve.Clearing houses centralized to a few countriesWith a shared mindset, clearing houses and central banks are operating a smaller portion of the value chain, but are perhaps the most critical from the operational standpoint. Banks are unable to exchange customer payments between different banks without clearing systems, and the clearing houses are centralized to a few countries.Some of the Nordic countries are still operating their own systems, but there are obvious signs that the local systems are becoming increasingly dependent on European or global infrastructures. Finland's national payment landscape is already fully consolidated to European and global infrastructures, namely Target2, TIPS and SWIFT network, and other Nordic countries are following.Global schemes come with global challengesAn important aspect to consider are card payments, the most global example of payment services. Over the years, more countries have started to use global card schemes. The value proposition is excellent as customers can purchase without a limit in the world with the promise that they will not lose money if they do not get what was promised.However, card schemes are very dependent on the same global network that is susceptible to DDos, Distributed-Denial-of-service attacks, and they are usually hosted in other countries the customers reside. It is the same problem that the banks have for account-based payments, but on a global scale.Taking up the challenge – Sheltered Harbor and scenario-based solutionsOne potential solution for dispersed payment infrastructures is a concept called Sheltered Harbor. In essence it is a local implementation, a copy of operations, of the most essential capabilities that can be put into use in a national context.It is particularly important to understand what problem we are solving. As the examples describe, this is an extensive topic with a multitude of complexities. The key issue is the scenario we prepare for. Point solutions will be sufficient for simple scenarios, whereas the more sinister scenarios will require more extensive efforts. Fortunately, this is not a technology issue for industry. The technology is already there, but how to ensure right-sizing and fit-for-purpose solutions that solves the problem is what requires further dialogue.Wish to share your thoughts?

Bye bye open banking – welcome open finance,/en/blog/2022/03/welcome-open-finance/,Digitalization / Vadims Lamovs / 14.3.2022,"Open banking is dead. PSD2 failed. Sounds harsh, but there is some truth to it.As I see it, too many markets implemented PSD2 to the maximum and then forced banks to do the same. The open banking effort was on regulations instead of focusing on the customer experience. And thus many banks opened only minimum mandatory APIs.This boils down to the risks the financial institution sees. Some banks worried that they would lose their market share if the services did not function smoothly while others did not have a clue about the usage patterns of new services. Moreover, some banks did not want to invest in open APIs as they did not see a business case or thought that there is a risk of cannibalizing existing business.Open finance is hereDespite the difficulties, electronic payment services and credit products and services have taken a leap forward. There are market-driven open finance initiatives highlighting ease of use and simplicity, and real chances for the banking industry.Just look at Klarna bank that has an open banking platform covering more than 6,000 banks in 20 countries across Europe. The bank offers the platform to e-commerce merchants, whose customers require easy payments. Shopping is also fast as a click is enough to pay for a dress or headphones.The beauty lies in BNPL, the Buy Now Pay Later payment, a customer can choose. If she wishes, the commitment can become a loan after 30 days. At that point, the merchant pays the same sum as it would for a card payment. Also, the experience is better than with a card and double authentication.One should not forget General Motors that makes more money by financing the sales of vehicles compared to selling vehicles. It is an example of how market participants such as merchants and producers can earn by financing. The bank can give the merchant a share of its revenue in financing via open finance and open APIs.So, why would any bank not want to offer private and corporate customers discretely a possibility to buy on credit in an effortless way?Get to know our Open finance and API servicesBanks need to join ecosystemsThe new world of electronic payments and financial services requires each bank to take a stance and act accordingly. The banks must study the end customer needs and customer journeys together with customers or in ecosystems of multiple parties.Co-creation is the way to create faster and more automated customer journeys where banking, payment, and credit products are fed with data from an API aggregation service. The data includes customer profile, market and relevant real time transaction data.As the APIs are there to be developed, I have a question for you: how does your banking API strategy look?Wish to share your thoughts?

Simultaneously, they need to manage decades’ worth of legacy. Jonas Blomqvist, Head of Analytics & Data at the airline company, described their journey in the latest episode of Data Insiders podcast.The one-by-one approach guarantees they can balance the short-term business needs with the long-term objective of a new, unified platform. “We need to prove our value to business daily. If they need to enhance data with other data sources, we cannot tell them they need to wait 2–3 years for a new capability. We need to provide the data right here, right now.”Open up the data to everyone in the organization“You don’t get a full value if you don’t also change the way of working and start to utilize the data in a new way,” says Blomqvist, who leads the work to foster a data-driven culture.Back in the day, SAS built data teams around technology stacks. Now they are aiming towards a data domain-driven organization – not one overflowing backlog, but several small teams close to stakeholders who can really understand their needs. It all hasn’t been plain sailing: Blomqvist has learned his lessons on implementing Power BI and is ready to share them, too.“You shouldn’t be afraid to unleash the power of self-service analytics. It can be a bit scary, but the way it transforms how people are working with data, how much quicker the organization becomes data-driven… it’s tremendous,” he summarizes.Are you interested to know more?

The tech sector needs more women – change will only come with determination and concrete actions,/en/blog/2021/03/the-tech-sector-needs-more-women/,Sustainability / Satu Kiiskinen  / 8.3.2022,"The IT sector has long been affected by serious personnel shortage. Hence it is required that potential of the entire population is taken in use. The road to technology industry frequently starts with choices made in education, but worldwide women still don’t seem to make this choice very often – among those who choose science, technology, mathematics, or engineering, only approximately 30% are women.In addition to solving the issue of the shortage of competent applicants, it is important to introduce a female perspective to the development of technology. In future, various algorithms will govern our lives and choices to an increasing degree, and it is by no means a matter of indifference who is responsible for creating them. If different perspectives are not noted in the software development, we risk introducing harmful biases to IT solutions as well. At the same time, it is clear that diversified teams increase the number of different perspectives that can drive innovation, which in turn has a direct influence on the success of any company.Often, the first spark and interest in technology is kindled in childhood. It is evident that we need different parts of society to join in shaping the perception of the IT sector; and tech companies have a central role in this. We must display exemplary role models and show more female leaders who can speak authoritatively on the importance of their work.Supporting diversity and equality is one of our core values. This is something we strive for actively and which has brought us international recognition from, for instance, Bloomberg and the SHE-Index. However, we still have a long way to go. Today, 29% of our employees globally are women, and we are not satisfied with this number. We believe an improvement can only be achieved through determination and concrete actions. Last year, we published our ambitious goals for diversity and inclusion: we aim to increase the number of women to 40% of our personnel by 2026 and to 50% by 2030.Reaching this goal won’t be easy, but we will work hard for it. We will be continuously monitoring progress, we will scrutinise our recruitment practises and make certain that both female and male candidates are always considered as final candidates for leadership positions. We will extend personnel training to build awareness on unconscious bias and we will also increase the number of development programmes and mentoring for women leaders. As one of the biggest Nordic IT employers, we believe we have an opportunity to make a genuine change in the industry.I extend a warm welcome to all women who wish to join the technology industry.", Satu Kiiskinen  ,Sustainability , 8.3.2022

The perfect mix: Working on passion projects and supported to continually develop,/en/blog/2022/02/the-perfect-mix-working-on-passion-projects-and-supported-to-continually-develop/,Meet our people / Giselda Autio / 1.3.2022,"My career was kickstarted in the logistics field while studying for my Master’s Degree. I have always been interested in different things such as psychology and international business. I chose to study international business because I thought it would bring me a variety of career opportunities. One thing that is good to note is that I don’t have a technical background through my studies. However, later I have become very excited about technology after realising through my work how inseparable business and technology actually are.After a few years of analyst work in the logistics industry, I started considering other options and found out that consulting really appealed to me. I applied for a job at a technology consulting company and started working as an SAP analyst. My career journey continued towards a Consultant and Consulting Manager role within the company. Fast pace, continuous learning, and complex projects sparked my interest in the consulting business. I believe that these are the things that still after ten years keep me motivated.When I joined Tietoevry, more than one year ago, I noticed immediately that I was surrounded by a very welcoming work culture. I was also impressed by the company’s diversity and sustainability initiatives and goals. These were also the things that influenced my decision to join Tietoevry.Motivated by continuously developing technology and SAP modernization projectsI feel that my current role as an SAP Lead (retail) combines perfectly my skills and ambitions. I’m really excited to have an opportunity to work with the biggest retail companies in the Nordics. Personally, this is one of the most important things for me because I’m specialized in the retail industry and now I’m able to work with the major players in this industry. It’s also a factor that makes Tietoevry stand out in the market.As an SAP Lead my role consists of working as an SAP expert in client projects but also as a People Manager for a team of 15 SAP Consultants. Our team is global and half of the people work in Finland and the other half in India. In a lead position, I feel that my mission is to support employees' career ambitions and take care of the work-life balance.Tietoevry being a leading company in SAP S/4HANA projects, there are plenty of opportunities to grow as an SAP professional. In these projects, my role is to understand and see a clear vision of the business needs and translate those to value-adding technology solutions. I’m a really process and business-oriented person, and I enjoy leading projects from start to finish together with design, testing, and technical professionals. At Tietoevry employees' professional growth is supported and while working on these projects I have had the opportunity to complete an SAP S/4HANA certificate.I consider myself a problem solver and maybe that’s why I’ve often drifted into situations that seem challenging at first. I will face this kind of situation with a calm mind and take it as an opportunity to grow professionally. Also, SAP as a domain enables endless possibilities to develop yourself and learn something new almost every day about this continuously developing technology.Knowledge sharing in Tietoevry’s international environmentTietoevry has one of the biggest SAP communities in the Nordics, with over 300 professionals. I’m impressed how the company with such a long history has innovated itself and remained relevant in the market. One positive surprise for me has been how much of an international company Tietoevry is. Nowadays I have for example colleagues in Norway and India to work and share ideas with.I feel happy that I have had a chance to create a unique career path that supports my ambitions and areas of passion, such as the retail industry, modern technologies, and sustainable development. At Tietoevry people come from very different backgrounds and no one is putting you into a predefined mold. There’s always space for individuals to grow in the chosen direction that inspires them the most. And that’s what I truly value!Do you want to join me and many more talented SAP experts?

ERP Architecture – 2 fundamental cornerstones and 4 architypes to serve your business,/en/blog/2022/02/erp-architecture--2-fundamental-cornerstones-and-4-architypes-to-serve-your-business/,Digitalization / Kari Pietiläinen / 28.2.2022,"1. IntroductionThere are two fundamental cornerstones to ERP architecture:the business capability and process scope of your ERP
the instance strategy of your ERP: single instance, or business division / geographical instancesThe picture below highlights these two cornerstones. The vertical axis indicates how many business capabilities or processes the ERP solution covers, e.g., general ledger accounting, accounts receivables, sales order processing, available-to-promise check, installed base, service order. The horizontal axis indicates how many business divisions, legal companies, countries, and factories the ERP solution covers.These dimensions need to be aligned with your business model and requirements. The next two chapters explain more details. Chapter 4 explains architypes for 4 different combinations of our dimensions.At the end of the blog, we also highlight the importance of user experience. It is the capstone for a successful ERP journey based on our two fundamental cornerstones.2. Business capability and process scopeERP integrates logistics transactions to finance – this is the core of all ERPs systems, and we can say that this integration is what makes an IT system a true ERP system. This is illustrated in the picture below.Why do we start from such a basic and fundamental topic? The reason is simple: to ensure that we understand the core of ERP, what capabilities and processes really belong to ERP – and what capabilities and processes have more flexibility in our ERP architecture. This is the area depicted in grey in the picture below.Logistics and Finance transactions which are tightly connected to each other should be part of the ERP scope. Examples of these are illustrated in the picture above in the light red finance core and green logistics area surrounding it.The grey area indicates business capabilities and processes which can be inside or outside of ERP. They do not directly create financial transaction, but they use data and “ERP documents” from the green area. The white area contains a few examples which normally are never inside ERP.3. Instance strategyInstance strategy is basically an easy topic – you just need to know if your business model isglobal – cross country borders, business divisions etc., or
local – you locally manufacture products in one country and / or business divisionDifficulty arises because business often contains both models. And changes to the business model, or underlaying ERP architecture, are difficult to make. Both the business model and ERP architecture are strategic and fundamental cornerstones.In a global multi-leg supply chain, most transactions, both logistics and financial, are internal to your enterprise. In these cases, single instance global ERP can provide the needed transparency and efficiency to your enterprise.A single-leg supply chain consists mainly of local transactions between your enterprise, or even a local unit of it, and your business partners. A local ERP instance strategy can bring flexibility and agility to your local business units’ requirements.The supply chain model is not the only aspect we need to consider. Also, legal structure, ownership of legal units, and future plans need to be taken into account. The table below summarises aspects to be considered for ERP instance strategy.4. Architecture architypesBusiness divisions specific / local ERPs work well when this approach is aligned with your business model and structure described in chapter 3. This approach also allows wide functional scope inside your ERP, because each ERP is a smaller business division / site scope dimension. This architecture requires well working centralized financial consolidation or “central finance” capability.There are several ERP products on the market for this architecture approach, both from global IT vendors and more regional IT vendors.Local best of breed architecture often leads to shared finance solution, with home-made integrations. Based on our definition in the beginning, this is not a real ERP system. This architecture works for organisations that do not need traditional ERP. Traditional ERP is very useful for organisations with physical (not digital) products, supply chain and production. If your organisation is pure digital, then this architecture might work for you.Single instance ERP with wide functional coverage is challenging to implement and run. Some large enterprises have managed to implement this architecture and they are enjoying benefits of single instance ERP. However, many of them have paid a large amount of customisation, even own code, as a penalty of this approach. We see a tendency to simplify large ERP solutions and go towards standard functionality. Often this also means reduced functional scope of the ERP. In this case more and more business capabilities and processes are implemented outside of the ERP.Only a few ERP vendors can provide a scalable and well working solution for this architecture architype.Lean single instance ERP is attractive for many organisations. This approach brings benefits from global transparency, both from a logistics and financial point of view, and allows business / local variation outside of the ERP. The key to success is defining your core ERP functionality as described in chapter 2 and main integration to outside ERP solutions. APIs and well-defined integration architecture are technical cornerstones in this architecture architype.The picture below summarises our 4 ERP architecture architypes. We at Tietoevry have experience from all these architypes. Contact us for assessment of your current ERP architecture, and more importantly to analyse your business requirements and design future ERP architecture.5. User Experience – capstone for successful ERP architectureThe right ERP architecture is not enough. On top of your ERP system(s), superior user experience is needed. Please read about Headless SAP  – how to make a superior user experience on top of SAP ERP or S/4HANA.", Kari Pietiläinen ,Digitalization , 28.2.2022
Will public cloud make SAP agile?,/en/blog/2022/02/will-public-cloud-make-sap-agile/,Cloud / Pete Nieminen / 25.2.2022,"Utilisation of public cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP etc) as the SAP platform and an ecosystem grows more than 150% annually. This rapid growth began in late 2015, when enterprises started to seriously plan the future of their ERP, especially after the announcement of mandatory S/4HANA utilisation.One way to cut transition costs was to change the platform to a more agile and cost-efficient option. Public cloud certainly makes migrating, transferring, transforming, and running SAP more cost-efficient. If the original question refers to financial agility, there is no doubt that the answer is yes. Another advantage gained during this process is that the organisation utilising SAP as their key business supporting and running application maintains the authority to make most of the decisions regarding their business-critical environment.But when people talk about agility and more specifically agile IT, they usually mean more than just the capability to scale and optimise costs. Agility means (by definition) collaborative effort of self-organising and cross-functional teams, adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continual improvement, and flexible responses to changes in requirements, capacity, and understanding of the problems to be solved. Merely changing the SAP operating platform will not ensure that you accomplish these things.What happens – or at least what should happen after the platform change – is what will make SAP agile. It does not matter if your S/4HANA journey is a Green-/Blue-/Brownfield or whatever you want to call it. What really matters is what happens afterwards.The first step is to build everything on a proven, SAP supported architecture that is as cloud native as possible. This should be based on best practice reference architecture, supported automation, required expertise and proven processes and operating models. Correct architecture enables the platform to support the evolving ecosystem. Evolving means transformation to cloud-native – where possible. Transformation has its limits. It cannot change the core SAP principles, like how applications are built, or how the licensing works. It will, however, create broader possibilities for making decisions and new options.What changes when you move SAP to public cloud? For one, you can plan and execute in shorter cycles and with more precise data. You know what your business needs and how it reflects to the ERP. Even though the licensing is fixed for several years, the infrastructure is not, and it can change on demand. You can right-size, you do not need to over-size just in case. An even bigger change comes from the possibility of choosing the best tools (whatever it means in your own requirements). You can choose cloud native databases, serverless integrations, utilise Cloud DevOps in your application development, apply SecDevOps – and you have significant freedom to make the future-proof choices for your own organisation. Essentially, your SAP will become agile, in several ways.", Pete Nieminen ,Cloud , 25.2.2022
Time to change your perception of Mainframe and learn how it connects to the cloud,/en/blog/2021/05/how-mainframe-connects-to-the-cloud/,Cloud / Anette Ottar / 24.2.2022,"Why do several industries still rely on Mainframe?Industries – like banking, insurance, retail and media – still heavily rely on Mainframe technology. Because it delivers the world’s best security and reliability with millisecond response times, enables hybrid cloud deployment and performance at any scale, it is still highly relevant in the technology stack. The world's top companies also rely on Mainframe to protect their data, run blockchain and machine learning applications, and enable digital experiences. It has proven its continued relevance in the cloud-native era, and this backbone of IT technology can also be taken into the digital era.So why do we still think Mainframe belongs to the past?Because of Mainframe’s traditional development approaches and tools, too often it is isolated from hybrid environments – left to run back-office applications and transactions. It is possible to connect Mainframe with the new technology in a hybrid cloud. Hybrid and multi-cloud provide consistency across multiple environments and recognize that each type of environment brings its own strengths to the table. We need to break down the silos and ensure the value chain across all operations, confirming our focus on efficiency and business outcomes.Value chain operation model – empowered by Hybrid Cloud!It is critical to evolve from a siloed model to a hybrid IT operating model that helps bringing data, technology and teams together.The result is greater collaboration and transparency – control, operational efficiency and increased focus on delivering business requirements.Establishing a hybrid, agile automated DevOps approach
Accelerating development speed and improving quality – creating teams that think holistically and across different technology stacks
Creating a common language – changes the conversation from ‘updating middleware on the Mainframe’ to ‘updating all middleware’Unifying teams starts with an open framework and common toolset that bring cloud-like experiences to the start of working with the Mainframe. This is possible with a technology foundation that makes it easy to access and automate Mainframe software lifecycle tasks using popular 3rd party and open-source tools such as Git, Visual Studio Code, Ansible, Service Now, and more. These tools allow programmatically writing scripts that automate Mainframe services. Using common toolsets fosters coordination and collaboration.All of this is now more possible than ever before because of Zowe. Zowe, the first open-source project for z/OS, is becoming the standard for mainframe access. Zowe provides an interface to all the common mainframe services teams’ need for development, pipeline and operations automation.What is the future of Mainframe?IBM z15™ is a new enterprise platform delivering the ability to manage the privacy of customer data across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. With z15, customers can manage who gets access to data via policy-based controls, with an industry-first capability to revoke access to data across the hybrid cloud.Encryption Everywhere – Building upon pervasive encryption, z15 can also encrypt data everywhere – across hybrid multi-cloud environments – to help enterprises secure their data wherever it travels.
Cloud-Native Development – Can give customers a competitive advantage by evolving how they modernize apps in place, build new cloud-native apps and securely integrate their most important workloads across clouds.
Instant Recovery – An industry-first approach to limiting the cost and impact of planned and unplanned downtime, enabling users to access full system capacity for a period of time to accelerate shutdown and restart of Z services and provide a temporary capacity boost to rapidly recover from lost time.Of course, having the latest version is not always the cure. There are huge changes happening in the ICT industry, and the speed of development is only going to get faster. Whether Mainframe can be replaced with something else, is to be considered. The choice is yours and we can help you to find out the best option for your business needs.Our focus is to help enable our customers to connect new and more traditional businesses efficiently, ensure our customer’s competitiveness and become digital winners regardless of their choice of technology.Learn more about how Mainframe Services and our experts can help you boost your business!", Anette Ottar ,Cloud , 24.2.2022

He recently visited our Data Insiders podcast to discuss successful data strategies.Today, we don't see data as a solely defensive weapon. Instead, it offensively opens new business opportunities across multiple industries: manufacturing, retail, pharmaceutical, and insurance, to name a few. At the same time, the role of CDOs has evolved, and they meet new requirements to succeed.The finance sector used to be the pioneering industry in developing new ways of using data, but is it still the one leading the change, or are the other ones catching up? As the EDM Council President – ""bringing the smartest folks in the room,"" as he says – John Bottega has an impressive view of the field.Frameworks describe the capabilities needed for data managementAs the role of data grows tremendously, cloud platforms lend their helping hand in managing it. Greater capacity and flexibility bring along new opportunities but challenges as well. You should avoid one thing above others: to take those mistakes made in the past 20–30 years and drop them in the cloud. You don't want your data lakes to turn out data swamps.According to a McKinsey report on Global Data Management Transformation, employees spend around 30% of their time in non-value-adding tasks due to poor data quality. Bottega emphasizes that when you hear people complaining about data quality, in many cases, it's not the data itself that's the problem but the management process that created that data.Data Management Capability Assessment Model (DCAM) is an established best practice assessment and certification tool that was developed for EDM Council members and was first used by finance organizations. Today, data creates new opportunities across industries – and cloud is where the magic happens. Therefore, a group of EDM Council members and partners, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Tietoevry, brought their experiences to the table and created the new Cloud Data Management Capabilities (CDMC) Framework. It is a free download for anyone. Now that the building work is done, we at Tietoevry have just delivered parts of the very first trainings of this framework.What kind of true stories did Bottega share on implementing these frameworks in large and small organizations?

Banking and financial services reinvented,/en/blog/2022/02/banking-and-financial-services-reinvented/,Digitalization / Helge  Moan / 14.2.2022,"The conversations I and my colleagues have had with our customers in the banking industry for the past 1,5 years, have brought out common needs in the aftermath of the pandemic.Let me present the most common needs and explain from my perspective how we can help. We, Tietoevry Banking, are here to help Nordic banks to free up their resources and costs to modernize and digitalize value chains and processes for better and more efficient banking. This, of course, is a statement that can be said by many vendors so what really sets us apart?A robust foundation for innovation in digital bankingInnovation is at the top of the agenda for most banking customers I talk to. Many of them are seeking help to embrace innovation and build and run a robust foundation for digital banking services while staying competitive and attracting and retaining customers.Furthermore, the banking customers’ satisfaction seems to be dropping especially in the corporate and SME segments, also shown by recent EPSI studies in Norway and Finland.We have the breadth and depth to support banks in the most critical areas of banking not only in the Nordics, but also globally – an asset that a few vendors have. At least, that is what many customers tell us when they realize our broad offering and extensive domain expertise. We have market-leading software and services solutions within many areas such as Cards, Payments, Core, Lending, Wealth and Financial crime.All our software banking products are uniquely positioned in their respective domains in the Nordics and deployable as SaaS plus have an elevated level of sophisticated localization layers and interfaces for the Nordic markets. The last thing is what really differentiates us from others.Smooth savings and lending operationsThe wealth and savings market has exploded, and people are more active than ever while lending is driven more by efficiency and compliance.Our strength as a digital banking partner is that we are the market leader in both areas, serving more than 80 customers in the Nordics and beyond. In the capital markets area, we modernize and help to set up the foundation for digitalization and future growth with our leading savings and wealth management platform. It is a suite of software products and product components for securities trading, fund savings, pension savings and other means.In lending, we have a modern solution to manage the complete lending process, which simplifies the entire origination and life-cycle process for mortgages, unsecured loans, and consumer credits. The fully automated solution saves time and resources, and ensures smooth customer journeys, freeing time for your core business.AI and Machine Learning solution brings advanced profit scoring to MedMera BankThe dual challenge of growing while reducing costI have also noticed that many European banks have set up aggressive targets from both earnings and cost reduction perspective. However, as BearingPoint's Banking KPI Study 2021 revealed, only a few of out of more than 100 benchmarked European banks manage to sustain their cost income ratio under 55%. The majority were laggards, with cost-income ratios exceeding 55%.This is interesting since we provide end-to-end banking to more than 100 Nordic banks powering some of the most digitalized and cost-efficient banks in Europe, with a cost income ratio below 40%.We do this through a unique delivery model that goes beyond traditional SaaS – by taking end-to end responsibility for running the banks’ IT solutions including compliance and security. Our current volumes and scale allow us to provide superior quality, security, and compliance efficiently and at a lower cost, freeing up resources for our customers.Our deep industry knowledge and strong portfolio within many different domains was further confirmed in a newly published report by Industry analyst firm ISG. Tietoevry was positioned as a leader in all four areas of the ISG Provider Lens Digital Banking Services 2021 Report for the Nordics:Leader in Core Modernization and Integration Services
Leader in Banking Governance, Risk and Compliance Services
Leader in Transformational and Digital Banking Services
Leader in Payment and Card Processing ServicesDownload the ISG Digital Banking Services report for the NordicsNew strategy with specialization and focusNow, it is time to wrap up. I feel that in general there is a lot for every bank and financial institution to solve, but most importantly, the banking solutions are there.We are here to help and will do that with a new focus. Tietoevry just recently launched six new specialized businesses with distinct focus and market position, and Tietoevry Banking provides services dedicated to banks and financial institutions.We believe that this updated ambition will reassure our banking customers that we are making long-term investments in key areas to be able to offer the best software and platform services today and tomorrow. We will make sure that new technological advances are incorporated in our product development and use the benefits of AI, data and analytics while staying one step ahead of regulations. So, compliance and security remain built in our software products.Also, we feel confident that our focus will help us even better to keep and attract the best experts within banking and financial services in the Nordics and globally. Last year, we recruited more than 600 new experts, from payments and compliance to lending and wealth management in our banking business despite the tough competition.Are you ready to grow with us?

Workday in practice – How I used Workday within the HR Operations,/en/blog/2022/02/workday-in-practice--how-i-used-workday-within-the-hr-operations/,Digitalization / Joakim Egnér Lin / 2.2.2022,"Recent change in my career path, from an end user administrator (HR Specialist) to a full-time Workday HCM consultant, speaks volumes about how I’ve perceived Workday as a tool for HR professionals. Not all HR tools are convenient, and using multiple tools that do not sync can be very difficult, a tale I keep on hearing on repeat from my HR friends in other companies.Claiming that Workday is a complex and unified platform may sound like a polished elevator-pitch, but based on my user experience as an HR professional, I have to say it lived up to the pitch. The following are some concrete examples of how I used Workday every day.Main source of dataFor us in Tietoevry, Workday is the main data source for employee-related information, where all changes in the other systems must originate from Workday. The benefit of keeping Workday as the main source of data is the possibility to extract high-quality live data. This is an important aspect for people like me in HR Operations, especially when our job includes swiftly providing necessary data to relevant stakeholders.Reporting and SecuritySecurity and privacy play an important role when handling large amounts of sensitive and/or personal data in Human Resources. When processing data directly in Workday, we could utilize its secure reporting capabilities. The possibility to use standard reports, and build, schedule, and share custom reports helped us to become more efficient. Workday supported our demanding reporting requirements whilst keeping a high validity of reported results. For admins, it meant that reporting was as easy as searching for the report, selecting needed filters, and hitting the OK button to run the report. The report could then be sorted/filtered directly in the interface – or easily extracted to Excel, or other formats.Using Workday in the teamAs a team, it can be difficult to work efficiently and move away from person-dependent knowledge. When performing tasks and actions in Workday, there is a possibility to add comments to the actions related to the tasks. For example, if I was supposed to approve a compensation change, I could add a comment to the approval action in Workday, providing additional information such as the ticket number from our HR helpdesk system.This way, it was easy to track the corrections of the Business Processes and the Worker History record. Since we all used this method when making changes, it was very easy to check the history and background for the change. This resulted in minimized person-related dependency, saved a lot of time and effort for “double-checking” actions, and improved our delivery and support for the rest of the organization.Ease of adapting to changes by configuring the business process definitionsAs an HR representative, you need to react to the ever-changing demands and requirements, so it is important to constantly challenge the ways of working. I have learned that in order to do that, you need to carefully balance the important aspects such as time, effort, security, and compliance.In Tietoevry, we adhere to maximum data security. For example, in Sweden we had a very limited view of the other countries´ employee records, and we also lacked the possibility to maintain documents, nor could we add additional information to the worker profile. When cross-country transfers happened, the needed employee information updates by Swedish HR had to wait until the employee started in the new position, and thereafter showed in the Swedish organization. This brought some practical problems.Before the merger, one person in the Swedish HR team was responsible to keep track of all cross-country transfers to and from Sweden. When our organization grew, it was no longer possible for one single person to be responsible. We also wanted to move away from maintaining several different Excel sheets to keep track of all the transfers and when to perform required actions.We decided to configure scheduled reminders in Workday, based on the transfer date (effective date) of the employee. The so-called to-do business process step is now triggered on the day when the employee shows up in Swedish records, containing a checklist of tasks to be performed before the first file is exported to payroll.By utilizing the to-do and its scheduling, we could move away from the Excel sheet with the “tick in the box” checklist or from the person-related dependency of setting up a personal outlook reminder.We could solve the problem also by adjusting and modifying the security policies, however adding the to-do step into the Change Job business process definition served the purpose with needed precision. This also shows how agile Workday is as a tool. You can find different solutions for the same problems and simply decide what serves you the best.Looking back at our ways of working, in my new role, I am very pleased with the tools that we had to support our day-to-day work for employees in Sweden. So pleased, in fact, that I’ve decided to learn more about Workday and become a consultant. This story I will save for the next time.Our Workday journey started in 2017, when it was first implemented in Tieto. A few years later, after the merger, a new implementation went live for our new company, Tietoevry. Tietoevry is now both a Workday partner and a happy customer of Workday HCM and Adaptive Planning solutions.

In the highly competitive landscape, we need data to see how we can improve i.e. time to hire, pipeline building, candidate experience.Internal mobility, retention and development will also be focus areas for this year. How can we retrain and reskill our employees to meet market and customer demands and ensure career paths for our talents? How can we create paths for internal mobility and development and learning tracks for employees? These are questions we need to answer.Employee engagement also continues as a big trend within TA. As long as it is a general shortage of skilled talent, the companies' ability to attract talent and ability to engage employees and potential employees will be crucial. To increase the level of attractivity for our target groups in the market and to have engaged and motivated employees who will stay and develop in the company.And last but not least: the hybrid way of work – how do we accomplish all the above in the new hybrid way of working. How do we create a sense of belonging when people are working from home? How do we ensure a good working environment?

Comparison of SAP S/4HANA solutions,/en/blog/2022/01/comparison-of-sap-s4hana-solutions/,Digitalization / Mikko Vepsäläinen / 27.1.2022,"In this blog, I will discuss the differences between the SAP S/4HANA products and assess each solution’s suitability for different client needs. In addition, I will tell you how these products can be expanded with client-specific features. Common to all of these S/4HANA packages is the fact that high configurability, use of Fiori, built-in analytics and the latest SAP innovations are fully supported by each package out of the box and are available as ready-made updates from SAP, provided that the versions are kept standard according to SAP guidelines. As an SAP client, it is important for you to be familiar with at least the main limitations of purchasing a cloud-based solution compared to S/4HANA any premise solutions.Table of contents:SAP S/4HANA Solutions
Summary of SAP S/4HANA Cloud and On-Premise Solutions
We Recommend
How are Expansions and Customisation Done?
Benefits of a Cloud SolutionSAP S/4HANA solutions are available for purchase as the following products:Broadly speaking, these solutions can be positioned from left to right as seen in the image:The solutions on the left are simpler, more standardised, well suited for quick implementation and, thus, deliver quick benefits for your business.
The solutions on the right offer more options for differentiation and innovation as part of your ERP processes. Common to all of them is extended support for integrated business processes and a significant increase in automation in repetitive routine tasks (robotics) requiring event-based data (AI, machine learning).
The SAP BTP Business Technology Platform is a cost-effective and highly compatible platform for all S/4HANA solutions for running interfaces, APIs, IoT connections, data storage and application modifications (cloud-native). Other cloud-based platform solutions are also available as alternatives to BTP.Generally, the products in the above images from left to right are also the most to least standardised ERP packages in the same respective order:The Cloud Edition on the left is a robust, complete suite maintained by SAP, and no modifications to the core product are permitted.
On the right is the on-premise version, which is still the most used in Finland and also supports cloud installation. Many of the existing ABAP coded customisations are supported, and modification is possible.
If you know how to configure S/4HANA on-premise solutions and are certified to do so, you can do the same with these cloud-based solutions (Essentials is configured via Fiori).The core of SaaS (Software as a Service) licensing for cloud-based solutions is flexibility. Under this licence model, high usability of infrastructure and the application layer, data security, the usage rights model, Solman, monitoring, alerts and mandatory technical enablers are included in the price. A partner is required with SAP during the projecting phase and in maintenance, but the partner’s role is reduced furthest in this option.As billing is based on event-based, easy-to-audit threshold values, SaaS contracts are easily and quickly scalable into larger volumes.SaaS licences are usually fixed for the duration of the contract period (often three years) and extensions may always be purchased, but there is no flexibility downwards. In negotiations, be aware of how contract changes (Curve-out) are realised in the event of an acquisition, for example. Usually, this is impossible until the end of the agreed licence period, or the stopping cash flow can be directed to a different replacement SAP product or service such as LoB, reporting, integrations, etc.
When moving to the Any Premise version, existing on-premise licences can be converted to S/4HANA licences. Regarding such licensing, one must still remember the restrictions on indirect application use and client or supplier access to the S/4HANA Any Premise version.Summary of SAP S/4HANA cloud and on-premise solutionsTable 1: Implementation and differences in licensing and maintenance* SAP S/4HANA Cloud, extended edition is not available for new customers from 25th Jan 2022. Still available for upsell/renewals. The replacement will be called SAP Extended Services for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition.As the comparison indicates, the Cloud (Essentials) Edition is clearly SAP’s answer to true multi-tenant ERP solutions such as Oracle, Infor and Microsoft. It should be noted that the Cloud (Essentials) Edition includes much more functionality than its little brother, the SAP Business by Design version for small businesses.Table 2: Modification management differences* SAP S/4HANA Cloud, extended edition is not available for new customers from 25th Jan 2022. Still available for upsell/renewals. The replacement will be called SAP Extended Services for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition.The main differences are found in modification and expansion permissions. The S/4HANA Cloud Extended Edition, S/4HANA Private Cloud and S/4HANA Any Premise are more open to the client, with more flexibility for modifications.All SAP ECC-compliant modules with new features are available, including pre-configured Best Practise templates for 64 countries.
Built-in analytics and the Fiori experience are included in all and can be modified with key user features.
Data can be sent or received as part of the standard process, utilising pre-built open APIs.
IaaS or cloud platform as a service, Azure, AWS, GCP, etc.
SingleTenant, a dedicated client-specific cloud environment.
In our experience, shared use of the SAP – MES-Manufacturing Execution System, for example, may require partner-coded functionalities in S/4HANA, which are impossible to implement even in the S/4HANA Cloud Extended Edition.Table 3: Implementation and difference in maintenance tools* SAP S/4HANA Cloud, extended edition is not available for new customers from 25th Jan 2022. Still available for upsell/renewals. The replacement will be called SAP Extended Services for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition.Only the SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition and S/4HANA Any Premise versions support transferring critical business ABAP applications to the new version. The suitability of ABAP customisations must be tested using Brownfield conversion tools, such as the simplification list. In addition, data transfer from an existing ECC version is possible via conversion or extraction in software. TietoEVRY’s SNP partner solution for a Bluefield method is an option.Table 4: Database and operative system modification and access differences* SAP S/4HANA Cloud, extended edition is not available for new customers from 25th Jan 2022. Still available for upsell/renewals. The replacement will be called SAP Extended Services for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition.The S/4HANA Cloud (Essential) Edition is a more standardised SAP system, only implemented in a new Greenfield install. In terms of modifications on the operating system level, the Private and Any Premise products are the most flexible.Important! The separately available Model Company options for speeding up implementation were briefly pulled from the market by SAP. Now, they are returning under a new name: Enterprise Layer. The S/4HANA Private Cloud and S/4HANA Any Premise offers 25 pre-configured industry templates.We recommendThe S/4HANA Cloud (Essentials) Edition can be recommended to small and medium businesses as an ERP suite, like the Oracle Netsuite or Microsoft 365. However, SAP includes more features than its competitors right out of the box in 2021. This is also a solid option for larger businesses in search of so-called Administrative ERP, meaning only the basic selling, buying and wider business functionality are located in the ERP and e.g. core production processes (MES) operate elsewhere. In addition, this can be recommended as a multi-ERP strategy when more extensive SAP S/4HANA products are not needed in other countries due to their size.The S/4HANA Cloud Extended Edition can be safely recommended to large businesses, as long as the differences to existing ERP functionality are carefully identified while understanding how to build missing features as a native cloud solution, for instance. A solid understanding of SAP’s roadmap for the coming years is also highly recommended. Scalability and high infra use are a target of constant development for platform partners, even in the future. In addition, the Extended Edition suits both new and current SAP clients, provided that the client is prepared for implementation via a new Greenfield install and discarding their own ABAP modifications.The SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition can be recommended to all large and small businesses whose cloud strategy is already clear but who have not yet decided on or implemented their final application standardisation level or application enablers required for competitiveness. This version ensures scalability and the use of existing ABAP applications in the future, alongside the conversion of existing history data as part of your new solution.The S/4HANA Any Premise version can be recommended to businesses looking for a quick transition to the S/4HANA ERP age with minimal risks and without immediate changes to their operations. In the short term, this version can be the cheapest way by far to update your licences and database to a S/4HANA version, and thus this version can offer additional time for your final SAP suite in the cloud, on-premise or as a hybrid.The Any Premise version carries over existing critical ABAP functionalities, and the SAP GUI can also remain as the user interface. Naturally, this version can also be used as a template for a modification project by a larger business looking to upgrade their operations with S/4HANA capabilities.How are expansions and customisation done?Within the cloud-based solutions, traditional expansions can still be implemented according to our recommendations:Modernise your existing ABAP software: Turn your existing software components into Cloud Native software for more cost-effective maintenance in the future and improved integration opportunities.
Be sure to utilise SAP S/4HANA’s public API expansion interfaces — in the future, these will be your only access to the core system.
Side by Side expansions works most easily in SAP’s proprietary Business Technology Platform.
When you want to expand, the Extended and Essentials versions offer three options:

In-app extensibility: Use SAP tools designed for key users. This is well suited for UI or standard report modification, such as screen modifications.
Side-by-side “Embedded Steampunk” extensions: When your specific need is close to the SAP S/4HANA data model, SAP has introduced the new “Embedded Steampunk” for ABAP as part of BTP, utilising a cloud connector. By using this, you avoid standard code violations and ensure you will continue to receive updated versions in the future.
Private Cloud and S/4HANA Any Premise: The traditional Z-ABAP and side extensions, cloud-native programs (Azure, AWS, Google)Benefits of a cloud solutionIn all cloud-based solutions, the client benefit should be a lower life cycle TCO (total cost of ownership) compared to the old ECC. This comes in the form of cheaper implementation of faster SAP product features, directly benefitting the business, but also as lower costs in terms of maintenance, such as infra, development, safety and personnel costs.Our view supports the SAP objective, according to the attached image:The most common and therefore similar client processes are HR, business, procurement and purchasing. These processes see the largest number of benefits from Best Practise and automation, also via the mandatory continuous versions from SAP.
Processes that improve the competitiveness and individuality of businesses are more challenging in terms of staying with the S/4HANA standard version.Industry-specific innovations will become part of the basic solutions, but the extra feature options under the Enterprise Layer name (formerly Model Company) will remain.Read more about starting your S/4HANA journey and trip tips here.If you’d like to hear more, get in touch!", Mikko Vepsäläinen ,Digitalization , 27.1.2022
Corporate cash management trends in 2022,/en/blog/2022/01/cash-management-trends-for-2022/,Digitalization / Alexandra Larsen / 24.1.2022,The implications from the pandemic for business in general and treasury specifically have already been enormous. Remote working created many challenges - not just in the mechanics of how a treasury team can successfully work remotely; it also forced a rethink of treasury strategy and an examination of how things should be done in this new world., Alexandra Larsen ,Digitalization , 24.1.2022
Corporate treasury journey – From automation of payables and receivables to in-house banks,/en/blog/2022/03/corporate-treasury-journey/,Digitalization / Jane  Strom Pedersen / 24.1.2022,"Being able to automate common daily treasury operations frees up treasury time allowing staff to spend more time on adding unique value to the organisation. Corporate size, location, and industry determine the functioning of treasury departments. Every treasury works differently, but most would agree that efficiency is key to its success. Becoming more efficient requires examination of existing manual processes with a view to automate and improve. Banks can and should partner up with treasuries to enable them to meet their efficiency goals, not least by providing sophisticated automation and reporting tools. Exploring how digitisation may enhance treasury processes and seeking their bank’s assistance can help corporates on this journey.As companies are pushed harder to do more with less, treasuries often take the lead in demonstrating the power of the latest technology and partnering with their lead banks.Companies around the world are faced with economic uncertainty and a heightened volatile market. In response, corporates are seeking to centralise core treasury activities, to aggregate the transaction flows and to reduce risks associated with operating companies. Moving from a de-centralised to a centralised (in-house bank, (IHB)) treasury organisation may become the aspiration of large and smaller companies alike.IHB concentrate treasury activities, thereby reducing the volumes of external FX and cash transactions, as well as the number of bank accounts and relationships. This not only optimises treasury operations but also leads to lower costs for the corporate.In fact, a recent market study shows that 45% of companies globally have implemented an in-house bank. Main motivators behind the decision have been reduced cost and bank independence, reduced operational risk by avoiding unnecessary movements of cash and enhanced liquidity management.FIGURE 1Figure 1 above is an example of an approach treasuries might take in moving from a de-centralized (step 1) to a fully centralized (step 4) structure. Not all these transformational activities are relevant for every company, but on balance the principle is true. Often companies consider a phased approached to centralisation, starting with those areas where they get the greatest rewards such as account visibility, centralised payments, funding, and investments. Using technology to achieve this will always be at the heart of the project hence, working with external treasury systems providers and banks becomes increasingly important. The choice of which treasury system or systems to use is often made at the beginning of the project and the planned implementation is synchronised in line with the phases to ensure that by the end there is a single centralized system.Using tools such as Virtual Account Management (VAM), banks can provide the digital power to drive the move from a de-centralised structure to a centralised one.Virtual accounts enable companies to achieve centralisation by simplifying, streamlining, and consolidating treasury flows. This leads to an improvement in visibility of cash. In addition to tackling the challenge of account rationalisation, virtual accounts can play a pivotal role in any payables on behalf of (POBO) or receivables on behalf of (ROBO) structures. If a treasury centre makes or receives payments on behalf of a subsidiary, that transaction will refer to the subsidiary’s virtual account number. This will reflect simultaneously in that virtual account and post to the physical account associated with it.The corporate VAM journey can be a multi-phased one starting with the most pressing need by identifying the treasury and ending with managing various inter-company scenarios including in-house bank solution as indicated in figure 2 below.FIGURE 2Not every corporate will choose the option of full centralisation but by understanding the benefits of what can be achieved, a corporate treasury can pick those areas where it makes sense to strategically digitise.Indeed, some banks are looking to offer the concept of IHB as a service to clients recognising that setting up an IHB from scratch can be a costly, complex, and time-consuming exercise.By partnering with their banks to implement these capabilities, corporates can take advantage of the banks’ services thereby increasing the likelihood of success in a cost-effective manner. One of the biggest challenge treasuries need to deal with when considering a change in structure is the internal technology. Treasury data is often held/stored in many places and systems and banks can also help here. Through their previous experience with other clients or their links to Fintech companies who have developed application program interfaces (APIs) to facilitate integration, banks can become corporate treasury partners for change.", Jane  Strom Pedersen ,Digitalization , 24.1.2022
DevOps breaks down silos and increases productivity,/en/blog/2022/01/devops-way-of-working/,NextGen Enterprise / Nicklas Hilmersson / 19.1.2022,"DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) across the entire applications’ service life cycle. Put simply, it is about breaking down silos between the two and bringing developers and operations specialists together. Through close collaboration, teams can leverage one another’s competence and employees aren’t bound to just one repetitive task. Instead, they can take end-to-end responsibility, solve new challenges and explore other areas, thereby making their job far more engaging. It is becoming the de facto way to efficiently manage your IT landscape, especially if you are pursuing a strategy to become a digital enterprise. Its adoption improves product readiness and customer satisfaction through faster time to market, as well as securing constant alignment with overall business objectives.

They should now focus on DevOps because it takes it to the next level,” says Anton Rytterstedt, DevOps Transformation Lead at Tietoevry. “It changes the mindset and the culture within the organisation and introduces automation and new tools that enable teams to become self-sufficient.” Before the adoption of DevOps, it is essential to be prepared for a significant cultural and organisational change. “When starting, customers think it will be a year-long transformation project, but in fact it is a journey towards the optimisation of IT services that never really ends,” notes Tapani Tirkkonen, DevOps Lead Solution Consultant. “A company that wants to be a leader never stops trying to continually improve.” He adds that there is often a great deal of enthusiasm in the beginning, but reality may strike: “Customers suddenly realise that everything may be slower and require more effort than expected. If you aren’t fully committed, then you can get stuck halfway. Others see DevOps as a life vest for a failing project; if you think you can complete a transformation in just a few months and get back on track, you are wrong. It will only make things worse.” One common mistake Rytterstedt has seen many times is companies trying to cut corners by mimicking other successful models: “They will probably fail because they haven't understood how to adopt those models into their own organisation, products and value streams.” With the words of caution out of the way, Tirkkonen emphasises that the correct adoption of DevOps can give considerable advantage in solving problems and addressing shortcomings: “All in all, it’s an attitude to develop efficiently and maintain what you have developed, especially when you are doing that in a modern environment.”Be sure you know where you want to goA well-reasoned DevOps journey begins with an initial assessment. This provides a platform from which you can fully assess and understand your current state and clarify where you want to go. It’s important to remember that each DevOps journey is unique and must be tailored for each enterprise because some paths may be unsuitable. Tirkkonen explains that by gathering an overall picture of the customer, there is a clearer understanding of the value streams, organisation, challenges and applications or products: “We draw up a roadmap together and then help them start implementing it. However, it's important that the customer understands that there are elements they can't skip.” Once the assessment is done, our expert teams can also provide solution implementation and platforms that include the tools that customers need to have in place. Rytterstedt has one important piece of advice: “Too many customers see DevOps tools listed on some website list, implement them and have a false impression that they are now doing DevOps. The tools are just enablers. What matters is how you put them into use, the processes around them and how you organise your work.”The irresistible growth of DevOps“When we talked about DevOps a couple of years ago and many customers were still immature, we would have highlighted three elements: employees’ mindset, organisational culture and technology. Once you combined those, you would have had an efficient DevOps,” shares Rytterstedt. Today, with the level of maturity in the market quickly growing, DevOps has become a fundamental building block in the Next-Gen Enterprise Services Framework that has been defined for modern and highly competitive enterprises. Rytterstedt points to the services being delivered: “You have the Next-Gen Enterprise Services Framework handling everything from tickets to operations. If we look at development, it’s about enabling the team to perform to the best of their abilities, to deliver a product with quality and to reduce its release cycles.” Moreover, the extensive use of automation is an important part of DevOps to remove manual steps throughout the product lifecycle process. DevOps practices have been further empowered through AI and Machine Learning, technologies that we expect will be used more and more comprehensively in the future. “In addition to AI helping systems to understand and predict things, there is also the growing use of the public cloud. It is changing our idea of operations and infrastructure, giving more room to development,” believes Tirkkonen.More reasons to consider DevOpsAn advantage of DevOps is the provision of short feedback loops, meaning that developers are notified about issues early in the development life cycle. This saves time, lowers costs and reduces the number of errors out in production. “If you are working in an environment where it is important to quickly make changes in production to present new features to end-users, DevOps is perfect. It also guarantees efficiency. You have better quality control and can rectify errors before they affect the users. This is a lot!” notes Tirkkonen. The adoption of DevOps can benefit employers by making it easier to retain employees with a modern way of working in a supportive and automated environment. It can also help to attract and retain the best talents who are always looking for innovative and exciting challenges. Struggling to hide his passion for the DevOps culture, Tirkkonen concludes by saying: “When efficiency is increased and manual tasks are removed, developers and others can focus on producing value, by being innovative and continuously improving products and services.”", Nicklas Hilmersson ,NextGen Enterprise , 19.1.2022
Why AI alone can’t release the full value of your business,/en/blog/2022/01/why-ai-alone-cant-release-the-full-value-of-your-business/,Digitalization / Mikael  Johansson / 14.1.2022,"The foundations have been present in the market for some time now, but recent developments in the end-to-end supporting tools and processes have made data more accessible to everyone. Those who are able to seize the moment can achieve a competitive advantage over their competitors.Learning from the pastAt the start of this century, organisations had channelled their efforts towards measuring and following up on their core support systems and solutions. Most mid-sized or large enterprises had invested millions of euros in the building of a rigid and solid financial data warehouse or reporting solution. While there was merit in such investment, reflecting on its outcomes now leads us to the following assumptions:The focus was mainly on past business activities
Decision making was more reactive than proactive
The attention was moved away from core processesEverything could have been different if companies had stayed focused on the baseline of their core business processes that really created value. The values thus generated by analytics solutions would have been much greater. Reports suggest that about 85% of the users who use analytics solutions find them sufficient with regards to their business needs. This has been the case for several years and is currently a hassle for many organizations. If business processes are more integrated to analytics solutions, the recognized business value would increase. To fully support and align an analytics solution to the core business processes, it is more or less mandatory to include structured and unstructured, as well as batch and stream data. This has been a challenge for many until recently, but it is certainly feasible with today’s modern data management technologies.Predict, don’t reactThe real value for any organisation is not in reacting to financial issues that have already occurred, but rather having analytical solutions that combine real-time core business data with forward-looking prediction models based on historical outcomes. This has been challenging to achieve due to high costs and technological boundaries. At this point, it is worth remembering the time when customers asked for real-time answers and your reply was: are you really willing to spend that amount of money?During the last five years, analytics and data solutions have taken huge leaps forward in terms of its ability and functionality. This is driven, to a large extent, by the introduction of public cloud platforms, where the scalability of functionalities is having a higher degree of impact across a shorter timeframe. This ensures that even smaller companies and organisations can utilize capabilities that were only available to enterprise-paying customers in the past.It has become much more efficient to set up analytics solutions that can identify a baseline of core processes and then simply add more historical supporting systems, such as ERP and HR. Today, there are no barriers to taking this slightly different approach. By doing so, your company can add additional value to your investment.Having an end-to-end Data & Analytics solution that can support both your users and customers will help you stand out in the market. This will become an even more important way of creating a competitive advantage over time.To sum up, let’s take a look at the values generated when you adopt an analytics solution that focuses on core processes rather than historic support systems:Higher agility to manage business decisions

Cybersecurity in 2022: (Do not fear to) Lift the lid off the can of worms,/en/blog/2022/01/cybersecurity-in-2022-do-not-fear-to-lift-the-lid-off-the-can-of-worms/,Cybersecurity insights / Maria Nordgren / 13.1.2022,"What does this all mean for 2022? It means many, many things. But instead of going, as per usual, into a list of trends of cybersecurity, I bring forth one key thing that I see applies very strongly going forward.That is: Do not be afraid to lift the lid off the can of worms in advance. Meaning that when a cyberattack is starting, there is a small window when it is possible to minimize its impact and damage. But to take advantage of this window, one needs to be prepared.Think about yourself, as an end user of a PC. You have a simple set of instructions what to do when the PC begins to behave in a strange way: pull the network plug. Simple and effective.Of course, in any given organization, IT environments are inherently much more complex than the one with one user. Nevertheless, what organizations need is a set of pre-prepared clear and simple instructions what to do immediately when a cyberincident is beginning. Preparations and simple instructions would enable utilizing that small window to ‘pull the plug’; to minimize damage and make it possible to be up and running again quickly.‘Be prepared’ in this cybersecurity context starts with a couple of basic things: risk assessment; a risk mitigation plan; and a rehearsed step by step action plan, including disaster recovery practices. This must be a board level thing, including implementing top-down training sessions so that everyone has the plan, if not in their backbone, at least at a level where everyone knows where and to whom to turn when a cyberincident takes place.Building and optimizing your mitigation requirements and readiness is not that complex a thing. Make no mistake: it is a lot of work. However, when it has been done, one has a clear set of tools and procedures how to make the most of the short window for mitigation – and a clear picture of what happens when these measures are taken. Without the need to pause to think what needs to be done, and what will the impact across one’s organization and one’s ecosystem, and customers be when the cyberplug is pulled.As an analogy, in any public building, there is a defibrillator on every floor, with instructions how to use it. In the same vein, every organization needs to have a plan and setup what is the immediate plan of action when a server of PC begins to behave in an extraordinary way.So: lift the lid off your can of worms in advance. Have a plan what to do, how to do it, what are its impacts, and how to resume business as usual when (and nowadays, it is indeed ‘when’ not ‘if’) a cyberattack comes your way.Think of it as an investment. Either organize the worms in your can, or in the worst case, you and your customers will be eating them. Cybersecurity year 2022 should be about lifting the lid of your can of worms in advance.Do you want to know more about how to improve cybersecurity for your organization?Cybersecurity guidebook

Is your customer interaction on par with expectations?,/en/blog/2022/01/is-your-customer-interaction-on-par-with-expectations/,Digitalization / Jesper Viktor / 6.1.2022,"Digital commerce is the modern way of doing business. Both for professional buyers, and for sellers doing business with other companies. Or B2B, simply put. It’s not an add on or a separate store. It’s an integrated way of serving your customers that touches on every function within your company.To be competitive in this landscape, you must be able to serve your business customers wherever they are. Professional buyers are looking for information and services online. In fact, they spend more time online on their own than interacting in person with salespeople.Customers won’t settle for anything rudimentary, they demand better service and a better experience, because they know what’s possible. If you’re not able to tailor to the potential customer online, how are you going to meet and serve them? How are they going to find you? Fundamentally, is your way of interacting with business customers on par with their expectations?‘All business is about the customer and if you don’t align your overall customer experience, then your competitors will catch up and even outgrow you.’Tailor your services to reach your business goalsTo digitally orchestrate the buying journey, many processes inside your company need to be automated and digitised to allow customers to interact with you. Through automation and scaling, you’ll become more flexible, you can innovate, tailor your services better and reach your business goals faster.In our experience, a digital immaturity within an organisation is often discovered when the customer journey is recreated for a digital commerce experience. There are many processes that need to supply information and communicate with the web-shop. We often see that even very advanced companies, with a good market position, have a big technical debt that needs to be addressed. Often, the systems have just not been developed with customer interaction in mind.Transformation of salesWhen moving from traditional field sales to digital sales, it is important to ensure that personal sales and digital marketing are linked and are working to reinforce each other. The sales funnel and customer journey need to be interconnected, thus harmonising the experience and information that is encountered by the customer across all channels.The key to loyalty is meeting expectations and providing the customer with the right service all the time. From there, you build trust and value.A good principle is to enable customers to find information themselves and to self-serve wherever possible. Then bring in your personal sales representatives as experts providing advice when the customer needs it along their buying journey.We see from time to time some resistance when implementing a digital commerce platform. There is often a concern that digitalisation of the sales process can result in losing the personal relationship with a customer, but it is important to realise which parts of the interaction chain add value and which parts a customer prefers to perform themselves using self-service. In general, professional buyers would like to access pure information themselves and handle transactions whenever it suits them.However, this doesn’t eliminate your personal sales team. By including them in the project as the layer that contacts customers for their feedback is important, as well as underlining their role as experts. They should still be the experts who closely follow a relationship with the customer, focusing on helping, advising and guiding them when that expertise is really needed, as well as ensuring they pop up in the digital sales journey at the right times.Reduce anxiety and increase salesWe understand why many B2B sellers can feel overwhelmed in the beginning concerning where to start, which is why it is important to find a good entry point and an efficient approach to scope the project.You need to find that entry point by exploring your current situation. Start by identifying your business goals, the current sales process, the customers’ needs and perhaps even look at what the competition does. A good idea might be to contact your customers and ask them directly what they require, and what experience they expect throughout the buying journey.
Keep track of the data to understand what the customer is doing, so there’s someone to pick up the thread when needed. Keep an eye on the ball to be alerted if a salesperson or customer service representative should step in. It is essential to always make it easy to directly contact your sales personnel.
Focus on finding the best solution that works for you and don’t define the solutions in too much detail. Work in an agile manner, reprioritise all the time and iterate that roadmap is the way to success.It is time to ask whether your digital commerce platform is meeting your customers’ needs.Are you interested in knowing more?

We see it today in attempts to describe its value by using classic resources like oil and gold as metaphors. But data, like for example music or literature, is not ‘spent’ when used. Sharing should be the norm, even in competitive arenas, as the benefits from efficiency gains and innovation outweigh by far the temporary advantage one gets from trying to stem the tide when hoarding data”.Ok, so how can we go differently about this then?“To see these gains, we must start making cocktails, the data kind! Blending different data either between organizations, or different functions within one, or both, will allow the pursuit of new solutions to old problems, or even a toehold towards tackling brand new ones. Too long and too much have data been seen as a necessary evil to get a specific process done. In just a few years we will be putting palms to foreheads thinking: “Why didn’t we see and reach for this potential earlier!”Making cocktails sounds like a cool and innovative thing to do – and of course the blending of the data needs to be done in a responsible and secure way. How do you think everyone should work together to make this happen – thinking about the data owners, the “blenders” and the society at large?“Data and information will hopefully enter the political arena, because it is starting to be understood that data is a critical national resource in every way this is defined. It lies at the heart of our efficiency and sovereignty as nations, in our ability to efficiently manage our traditional resources and create quality services and improved quality of life in all of its phases. At the moment many branches of government are thankfully spearheading great advances, and cyber defence units have become the norm.Still, the principal, value-based discussion on data and information’s position and function in society, and individual lives, is nowhere near high enough or informed enough on the public agenda - with perhaps the exception of GDPR, an important perspective and a necessary piece of legislation. Unfortunately, it is not able to live up to its own ambition to not stifle innovation.A democratic society generally postulate rights and obligations that come with participation. It is time we start discussing also what obligations we have as citizens to share information, in order to do better for everyone and how do we define and enact ownership. You may think there is no alternative to our current norm. The kicker is that many of our conceptions, practices and laws related to ownership of data is stuck in the same mode that made it seem sensible to use oil and gold as metaphors.", Kim Remvik-Larsen ,Data , 21.12.2021
The key to recovery? Strategic workforce planning,/en/blog/2021/12/the-key-to-recovery-strategic-workforce-planning/,Digitalization / Fred Olsson / 20.12.2021,"The workforce has fundamentally changed, and there’s no going back. Eighteen months ago, as the world went into lockdown, organisations worldwide mandated or encouraged working from home. Now, that so many of us have embraced the practice, few are eager to head back into the office for the usual 9-5, seven days a week once restrictions lift. Amid all this change, one thing is certain: decades-old workforce planning processes will be of little help to businesses. Business leaders must start thinking about how they can prepare for what’s next.Agile strategic planning is key. With questions over the use of office space, employee productivity, COVID-19 restrictions and how businesses recruit and retain talent, HR, Finance and IT leaders need to act quickly, and this begins and ends with strategic planning. Here’s how.The planning disconnectTraditional workforce planning processes are relied upon to establish a plan for the year or quarter ahead. However, the pandemic shattered any notion that this static environment is still fit for workforce planning in the post-pandemic era.Many organisations find their workforce planning environment to be disconnected and hindered by legacy systems. It includes manual, laborious tasks, stale and often incomplete data, and fragmented communication and decision-making across departments. The result? Sporadic workforce planning, characterised by siloed decision-making, misaligned goals and priorities. That leads to bad hires that don’t suit the needs of the company’s growth and future plans. Relying on traditional planning cycles limits HR’s ability to adapt to the dynamic realities of the business. And that’s a big problem.Agile integrated planningThe truth is, if you’re not operating with agility, you won’t be able to steer your business successfully into the future. This is likely why a growing number of HR leaders have adopted an integrated agile workforce planning approach.Rather than saddling HR leaders with a siloed and misaligned environment, Adaptive Workforce Planning equips them with the ability to plan their workforce in sync with all other business plans, from corporate strategy to financials, operations, departmental budgets, and forecasts. This creates a comprehensive and dynamic workforce plan in sync with the business’ strategic goals. And it helps HR teams transition from tactical planning to more strategic workforce planning that puts the right people in the right place at the right time.Plan for every scenarioAs the workplace evolves and businesses try to find a new normal, planning and particularly ongoing scenario planning can be the difference between growth and stagnation. Scenario planning allows leaders to model various what-if scenarios based on an array of potential outcomes. More than ever, it is critical that businesses can quickly and easily iterate and develop multiple contingency plans. This is the key competitive advantage for businesses wanting to maximise the potential of their workforce.Workforce planning scenarios can range from modelling immediate needs to understanding the long-term implications of hiring, outsourcing, development, remote workers, or a return to the office. Other modern planning scenarios that are crucial include:Reskilling and upskilling costsDigital transformation and market conditions are changing the roles of existing workers. Decision-makers will need to model the full implications of reskilling or upskilling to address skill gaps. In companies where employees have been furloughed, and sectors such as retail and hospitality, the ability to understand the workforce’s needs and upskilling requirements is critical. It is only possible through integration and scenario planning.Managing a remote workforceMeasuring how employees may be impacted by remote work may lead to new metrics and benchmarks. Furthermore, by planning for every scenario and being able to pivot with agility, businesses can mould a post-pandemic culture that stands the test of time.Employee developmentDetermining the financial and operational pros and cons of various retention and development efforts will become increasingly vital. This is because the rise of remote work gives employees more options than ever. By balancing resources across departments and planning for spikes in resources and growth, business will be able to retain and attract talent. While also providing new opportunities to drive innovation and move the business forward.Most leaders will model the best, worst, and most likely case scenarios. The beauty of a modern, integrated planning approach is the ability to quickly and easily course-correct and recalibrate to build an efficient and productive workforce. Using data analytics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, scenario planning empowers HR to work with the actuals from HCM, CRM, and other enterprise applications, along with external contextual data. It provides insights to make the most informed, strategic decision possible and implement new scenarios rapidly as and when conditions change.Disruption is here to stayIt would be naïve to think that post COVID-19, business and economic disruption is over. In reality, there will always be scenarios where businesses will need to pivot and have the agility to move quickly.Embracing scenario planning, integrating it across departments and having all your data in one place doesn’t have to be a daunting prospect. In fact, you will have the structure and insight to understand the impact of unprecedented events on the whole business – from employee retention to skills shortages and budgets. And, then crucially, make the right decisions that will help build your workforce, inspire your customers and deliver the growth that will drive the business forward.With change and disruption now the rule rather than the exception, there is little time to waste. It’s time to integrate, plan, plan and plan again.Does the agile workforce planning topic resonate with you?

Why use cloud backup when my data is already in the Cloud?,/en/blog/2021/12/Why-use-cloud-backup-when-my-data-is-already-in-the-Cloud/,Cloud / Petr Magula / 20.12.2021,"But there is always a risk of data loss in several situations:Accidental or unintentional deletion of data by users
Third-party or hackers install malicious apps on your domain
Theft or loss
Ransomware encrypts your data and then demands a ransom payment.Advantages of Cloud Backup ServicesCloud-based backup systems do a lot of hard work when it comes to arranging and maintaining a backup. Advantages such as:Risk of Human Error is ReducedWhen it comes to cloud-based backup, human error is rare. However In the event of a tape-based backup, the person in charge of changing the tape leaves on vacation without transferring the duty to someone else. It's easy to foresee what will happen next. Consider the following scenario: Assume the backup is split onto two cassettes and the client is unaware. When the first tape is full, it pops out, and the client thinks the job is done—but oops! It's requesting a second cassette, thus the backup isn't finished.It can also happen if a junior employee keeps shifting blank cassettes in and out every night; they don't receive a failed message, but they don't understand the backup service is down. You can avoid these problems by using a cloud-based backup.ConsistencyYou don't have to rely on a single server or PC with enterprise cloud backup. A wide network of server centres can be found all over the world. Even if an entire facility goes down—which is quite unusual in the first place—another section of the network will cover it.Speed of Restoring DataIn some circumstances, restoring data can take a long time, but with Cloud-based backup, you can recover your data fast and easily (in few hours). Cloud storage is more efficient because it eliminates the need for physical delivery from an off-site location, tape handling, and seek time. Data that has to be restored is identified and streamed across the WAN, saving time and removing the requirement for a local tape infrastructure.MaintenanceUsing a service provider to manage cloud backup is simple. There's no need to be concerned about your data's physical location or storage capacity because the provider will manage it remotely. Furthermore, transferring backups to the cloud safeguards your data from ransomware threats.TietoEVRY has partnered with AvePoint to provide customers with secure collaboration solutions using Microsoft 365Backup may seem like just another item on your to-do list, but consider the consequence of a single data loss event. It will be inconvenient at the absolute least, and it will cost you money.TietoEVRY have partnered with AvePoint, one of the largest Microsoft 365 data management independent software vendor (ISV), to secure and protect Microsoft 365 and Teams.Read fact sheet about the most complete cloud-to-cloud backup solution in the market here.", Petr Magula ,Cloud , 20.12.2021
Continuous learning secures the future of our company and our people,/en/blog/2021/12/continuous-learning-secures-the-future-of-our-company-and-our-people/,Meet our people / Kaisa Kauppinen / 17.12.2021,"Learning culture as a cornerstone of developmentAt Tietoevry, continuous learning and development are part of our key values, along with client centricity, co-operation, and trust. Our learning culture emphasizes every employee’s learning path, curiosity and growth.All our employees use three pillars in designing their annual development path: learning from experience, social learning, and formal learning. Our learning culture is based on a 70-20-10 rule – enabling everyone to learn in diverse ways.Some 70% of learning happens through practical experience that can be gained from learning on the job, through role rotation, in new projects, or by experimenting with new ways of working.Social learning covers 20% of our learning culture and is supported by knowledge-sharing in our learning communities, by mentoring and by networking.Finally, 10% of every employee’s learning time is reserved for formal instruction through courses and educational training, covering both practical and theoretical knowledge.Social learning breaks down silosIn the spring of 2021, Tietoevry was searching for Competence Leads interested in supporting learning and development as a part of our “Keep learning” initiative.The initiative resulted in eight strategic competence areas receiving their new leads and I – to my great joy – got to head the customer experience competence area. I have worked within customer experience and design for more than two decades, and also have a qualification in vocational teaching. So I was very excited about such an opportunity!The Keep Learning initiative and the competence areas focus on helping our employees in learning and developing by providing 30 learning communities for the purpose of social learning.In the competence area of customer experience, we currently have six learning communities, each of which has a designated lead. The purpose of the communities is to support and encourage employees across the company to share their knowledge, activate members of the community to participate in events, and generate new information and insights.As a part of the Keep Learning initiative, a Keep Learning Week is organized twice a year. During these weeks, we provide both external experts to train on topical subjects, and encourage our own employees and communities to organize learning sessions, webinars, and trainings. The most recent Keep Learning Week was held in November 2021, with more than 1,800 employees taking part in the learning sessions.The initiative also includes Keep Learning Fridays, where every Friday Tietoevry employees are offered the opportunity to learn something new in a few different training sessions, with topics varying from week to week. At their best, shared learning moments break the invisible silos of a big company, support networking, and create new opportunities.Never-ending curiosity for learningMy personal learning path has been nothing short of multifaceted, and that is how I am aiming it to continue in the future. I thrive in solving dilemmas, experimenting, and gaining new competences.My curiosity for learning and developing led me to start my doctoral studies in the spring of 2021, with the ambition of providing new knowledge, insights and benefits to social and healthcare information system design.I believe in what our CEO Kimmo Alkio once said: “Life-long learning is a cornerstone for both the individual development of the employees and the success of the company.”", Kaisa Kauppinen ,Meet our people , 17.12.2021
Time to put sustainability at the heart of your operations,/en/blog/2021/12/time-to-put-sustainability-at-the-heart-of-your-operations/,Sustainability / Ulrika Lagerqvist von Unge / 15.12.2021,"At the same time, the business case for sustainable operations is becoming clearer day by day; talent is moving to employers that place sustainability at the core of their actions; the market opportunities connected to the achievement of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals are estimated to US$12t in 2030; and global consumers are willing to pay more for a product if it comes from a sustainable brand. In other words, the pressure on enterprises to both mitigate the negative impacts of their operations, and be part of the solution to many of our planet's most serious problems comes from a range of stakeholders.Against this background, companies should now be putting sustainability at the heart of their operations. Many would like to do so, but it is not always easy to know how to turn that intent into action.To start with, any solid operation needs to be steered through good information and accurate insights. Today, many companies collect and report on their sustainability performance annually for internal and external stakeholders. As collecting and analysing this data is a once in a year exercise, a company’s impact on people and planet is effectively being steered through the rear-view mirror. It’s looking backwards in order to move forwards, with the effect that planning and decision-making are often going to be behind the curve.The truth is that it’s a tedious and time-consuming task for a company to identify the right sustainability data, collect it, compile it and analyse it. Companies spend hundreds or thousands of manual hours on this exercise for annual-reporting purposes alone. Replicating the same tasks with a more frequent interval would require a massive amount of time. This is time that could be spent on other tasks with a bigger impact on operations and the surrounding world.Marrying technology, sustainability and business competencesBeing a sustainability professional in a powerhouse of technology and business consultants, I realised that Tietoevry actually had the means to develop a solution to these challenges. So a team of technology and business consultants came together to package it all up as the Sustainability Data Hub: a methodology that makes use of our sustainable business insights and technologies to give our customers instant and automated access to sustainability performance in near real time.Taking the hub into use starts with strategic scoping – a process where we work with our customer to identify the right parameters, metrics, use of data, and intervals. In the next phase we focus on the technical aspects, identifying the data sources and deciding how to automate data collection. In the final phase, we map and visualise the collected data against metrics and targets. Data analytics and scenario modelling can also be added, depending on business needs.Putting sustainability at the heart of operations – in practiceThe direct benefits of the solution are many – from reduced time spent on manual data collection to improved decision-making and risk management. Other benefits include easing compliance with new and upcoming sustainability legislations and frameworks, as well as more frequent sustainability reporting to stakeholders – meeting demands for improved transparency.In a fast changing and increasingly uncertain world, futureproofing your business is more important than ever. Companies need to listen carefully to their stakeholders, understand their operating context, and adapt quickly to the world around them. We hope that our Sustainability Data Hub can be a companion and a compass on the bumpy road ahead. If we can together transform business by putting sustainability at its core, we will all be the winners of tomorrow.Learn more about the Sustainability Data Hub features here", Ulrika Lagerqvist von Unge ,Sustainability , 15.12.2021
From Production Engineer to hands-on Data Scientist in healthcare technology,/en/blog/2021/12/petteri-ranta/,Meet our people / Petteri Ranta / 10.12.2021,"A Senior Data Scientist, saxophone player and passionate bookwormAfter just 6 months as a Senior Data Scientist at Tietoevry, it's easy to feel being a part of the team because of the diversity of the work I have been exposed to. Using Big Data, AI, API design and in-house data analytics tools, we are constantly challenging ourselves to build a more intelligent healthcare and wellbeing unit using cutting edge technology.My work drives me, but I’m not an all work and no play kind of man. When I’m not at work, I have my hands pretty full with my interests and my family! I am a father of 3 kids, a saxophone player, and a cat lover. I can also spend hours glued to PC games, especially Dota 2. You can also call me an avid reader and fan of theology, which I enjoy in many forms - books, podcasts and debates. During the short Finnish summer I spend long and late evenings at rivers, fishing.From production engineering to data scienceInformation technology and AI caught my attention during my time as a Bachelor’s student in Turku University of Applied Sciences, in the field of mechanical and production engineering. Hence, I decided to move to Tampere University of Technology for my Masters in software development and data analytics. I began my career in 2017 as a PhD researcher. I worked on various applied AI such as remote sensing, satellite and drone data, computer vision and time series forecasting. I also delivered numerous workshops with the idea of further pushing the understanding of the countless possibilities of AI and published four articles during this time.However, during the time I was finalising my dissertation, I realised that I was looking for more than just building research models. I wanted to work hands on and be a part of the change and growth in the healthcare industry. So, I got in touch with Joona Pylkäs, the Head of Data and AI in Tietoevry’s healthcare unit, who was hiring AI professionals at the time.Automation as key to intelligent healthcare of the futureThe main reason I wanted to be a part of the healthcare technology industry is that I think there is a massive amount of technological advancement needed to help make the healthcare industry more accessible and make it easier for doctors and patients to take better care of their health.I believe automation is key to intelligent healthcare of the future. It is the key to enable healthcare professionals who are already burdened with an overload of health data. Automation will help to streamline the data related manual processes. It will also help healthcare professionals make the best use of the vast amount of information and patient history available to them, which will give them more time to care for patients. For patients, this means your personal health data is readily available. This can be accomplished with advanced technology and collaboration between cross-functional experts from software and data science professionals to hardware engineers and UX designers etc.Digitizing healthcare to enable accessible and faster carePushing the boundaries around the digitalisation of healthcare and wellbeing is at the heart of everything my team and I do everyday. Currently, we are working with data pipelines in a big data environment, building in-house data analytics tools and creating proof of concepts for healthcare customers.We are also building a segmentation tool for people with possible diabetes, as well as an optical computer recognition system to digitize paper forms. In short, our purpose is to digitise all possible patient health information for both patient and doctor, so that they are accessible today, and to help find possible diseases and diagnoses faster in the future.Team spirit, technologically mature working environment and a direct impact on societyIt’s difficult to choose the best parts about my everyday work at Tietoevry. But one thing is sure: I do hands-on work and gain real time experience everyday, exactly how I had envisioned it before starting at Tietoevry.Having the opportunity to work in an technologically mature environment with cloud based microservices is definitely a major factor. The other part for me is my team - our Intelligent wellbeing unit of ten talented health tech professionals. We are a group of cross-functional people, who get to work on infrastructure to software development, product design, end user design, and API interfaces.I also love to work in our small group of 3 data professionals, where our daily morning meetings are personally very important for me. From sharing work related to personal anecdotes, this call helps keep the spirit of the team alive.Perhaps the most important factor is that my work is creating a direct impact on society and plays an integral part in the solutions Tietoevry is providing to technologize the healthcare industry in the Nordics. I get to learn and implement new tools and technologies, face new challenges and come up with innovative cutting edge solutions together that have an impact on many peoples’ everyday life.Do you want to join me and many more talented experts?

How cloud backup can support your business when working remote,/en/blog/2021/12/How-cloud-backup-can-support-your-business-when-working-remote/,Cloud / Petr Magula / 10.12.2021,"Here are 4 benefits of Cloud Storage while working from homeImproved AccessibilityThe phrase “working from home” suggests employees can only do work have access to while confined in their house. However, cloud storage allows for a more wide-spread accessibility and efficiency.Storing and organizing files on a remote cloud storage server provides access from anywhere via the internet. Additionally, it also provides a centralized system for accessing other files like a co-workers’s documents when you’re working together.Better Collaboration and no duplicationBetter Collaboration and no duplication with cloud storage and digital files; you can work with others on the same documents and projects simultaneously, and when files are edited, a single version is updated to keep changes organized.Editing paper documents requires printing out duplicates. If multiple people create and edit different copies of the same file, it’s easy to lose and miscommunicate data.Simplified Data BackupsWhether it concerns about disasters like accidental file deletion or spilling your morning coffee on the computer sitting in your lap, with cloud storage you always have a backup of all your data stored on remote storage servers to fall back on.In many cases, cloud storage systems have tools for automatic backups. You can upload and add new files immediately after creation. However, you can save spare copies of files manually if needed.Subscription-Based for temporary needsAs a SaaS, cloud storage costs are subscription based and don’t require businesses needing to personally invest in any kind of equipment.Besides the benefit of saving on up-front costs, cloud storage subscriptions can be cancelled and stopped. This makes them a flexible option for when work-from-home needs are constantly changing.Even if you are a small business, it can take a massive amount of time to manually manage all the security parameters needed to protect collaborative data. This time-consuming, complex task is even more complicated for anyone that is in the process of digitally transforming their workspaces. Thankfully, we can help!TietoEVRY has partnered with AvePoint to provide customers with secure collaboration solutions using Microsoft 365TietoEVRY have partnered with AvePoint, one of the largest Microsoft 365 data management independent software vendor (ISV), to secure and protect Microsoft 365 and Teams.Read fact sheet about the most complete cloud-to-cloud backup solution in the market here.", Petr Magula ,Cloud , 10.12.2021
"The bigger the company, the bigger the impact",/en/blog/2021/12/sami-puttonen/,Meet our people / Sami  Puttonen  / 8.12.2021,"When I started in my Senior Software Architect/Developer position at Tietoevry in August 2021, I became part of a company I already knew from before, as I worked here in a similar role during 2018–2019.You might imagine that a small company offers better opportunities for influencing one's tasks than a large company. However, my own experience speaks the opposite: the bigger the company, the bigger the impact. For example, at Tietoevry, the options for developing my own specialist role are excellent, and that’s what drew me back to the company. We have a wide range of interesting projects that you can choose to take part in based on your own interests.Learning new things is in my DNAWhenever the opportunity arises, I make time for studying and learning new things. You can’t keep up with the progress in the ICT sector unless you’re constantly up to date with developments and are willing to develop your skills and knowledge. TietoEVRY offers its employees opportunities to attend training in various ICT sub-disciplines. Moreover, we can receive financial support for the latest training from external providers.Learning is intrinsic to me, and hence, I’ve studied my whole life. My background is in engineering, and I’m also a personal trainer and a mental coach. In my mental coach studies, I have learned that solid interaction skills are very beneficial also in the working life.I appreciate the freedom of working hereSince my return, I’ve worked on a pensions system project for Keva, Finland’s largest pension provider. The task is to renew and modernize their pensions payment system. As a specialist in software architecture and development, I am using Java and Angular to implement the system onto the cloud computing service Azure Portal. Currently, this project keeps me fully occupied.Thanks to the already familiar people at Tietoevry, I instantly felt like returning home. I appreciate the company’s tangible trust in its employees. Being a part of Tietoevry provides a lot of freedom — you can work from anywhere. All that matters is that the job gets done. This suits me well because I like to balance my days with sports. I start my workdays early and take a break at lunchtime, followed by a relaxing run to reload my batteries. Later in the afternoon, I might visit the gym and then continue working in the evening. This offers me the perfect freedom of working when I feel most productive.In case we got you interested take a look at our open positions in our team: Java Software Developer/ ArchitectIn addition to sports, I’m involved in the organizational activities of the Union of Professional Engineers, and I’m also a member of Insinöörilaulajat (The Engineer Singers) male choir.

Time to get up and running fast on a cloud platform,/en/blog/2021/12/Time-to-get-up-and-running-fast-on-a-cloud-platform/,Cloud / Cathinka Scheie / 7.12.2021,"Let’s start with a definition of cloud computing. What is it exactly?A short definition: cloud computing means that you have access to IT resources that are not made available or managed by people but are instead made available through automated processes.The COVID-19 pandemic and sudden changes in patterns and consumption are proof that organizations need to be both responsive to these changes and agile enough to adapt. The last year we have seen a clear correlation between cloud adoption and cloud maturity of companies and how well they perform financially.Reach cloud benefits faster, without disrupting your businessSo, it’s time to reach cloud benefits as fast as possible and without disrupting your business. But what is the best path to the cloud for organizations? Unfortunately, there is no holy grail, as many cloud transformation options serve different business needs best.There is a well-known standardized model for migrating the applications to the cloud that is known as the 6 R’s:​Replatform


Refactor


Replace


Rehost


Retain


RetireBut there is a faster way to the cloud. In addition to those six «R» ‘s, there is luckily the seventh “R” Relocate that strikes a balance, reaching meaningful cloud gains at a reasonable speed without creating disruptions to business. This method tremendously speeds up cloud journeys. It decouples business transformation from technology transformation, thus allowing organizations to get cloud benefits from new technologies without forcing businesses to change simultaneously.With the seventh “R,” we Relocate the applications and workloads from data centers to cloud as they are, without redesigning the apps. This means migration can be done with almost no business disruption.So, what’s the story with “Relocate”?A new generation of IT management tools expands your current environments to cloud. It allows you to perform large-scale migrations of virtual machines with close to zero downtime for your application in the best of cases. This can dramatically increase the speed of migrations to the cloud.In cloud, public environments are a necessary enabler for low-risk and speedy cloud transformations. It specifically allow you to keep your on-prem setup on-prem, but with the cloud benefits mentioned below.A cloud shortcut, but not short on cloud benefitsFull cloud transformations are still essential for some companies, but “Relocate” can deliver cloud benefits much faster.Once applications and workloads are relocated to a cloud environment, organizations immediately see some of the key cloud advantages: flexibility, scalability, fast provisioning, API-driven automation, security by design, and improved business continuity, along with the obvious benefit of shortened lead-time to cloud.Today, new technologies and strong partnerships with service providers can simplify the adoption of cloud solutions, and enable swift migrations. This makes the “Relocate” method a no-brainer for organizations seeking to reap cloud benefits straightaway.Building a successful migration path starts with the design of an optimal environment. We help you build a migration plan that allows you to successfully move workloads to cloud. Read more here.Book a Cloud Advisory Assessment here to get started.", Cathinka Scheie ,Cloud , 7.12.2021
Offshoring: It's not just about low costs,/en/blog/2021/12/offshoring-its-not-just-about-low-costs/,NextGen Enterprise / Manish Kumar / 6.12.2021,"Uncertainty and disruption are now an integral part of every business environment. How do you continue being customer-centric, innovative, flexible, secure, cost-effective, and compliant while staying ahead-of-the-curve in such a dynamic scenario? How do you remain close to your customers and yet offer them the best services at the most competitive price? What mix of the above models will best suit your enterprise?Welcome to a hybrid world – where no problem or solution is one-dimensional and architectural complexity is passé. As risks and profits become more closely aligned, business models need to be more resilient and future-proof. These models must be customized yet global and open to frequent changes that suit multiple situations while ensuring business continuity. It’s time to up your game and take your delivery models to the next level.Making IT work for youAt Tietoevry, our focus is not on ‘what we can provide’. Instead, it’s about ‘what suits our customer best’. We help our customers identify cost-saving areas by simplifying and rationalizing their assets so that they can invest the savings in expanding growth and innovation. We also advise and guide our customers to capture the benefits of digitalization.So, how can you achieve these almost contradictory objectives? We know that one size does not fit all. Therefore, we have defined and use a variety of delivery models. These models work individually and together based on the specific needs and objectives of our customers.1. The “Nordic First” ModelIn this approach, the majority of customer engagement happens in a local setting, in the local Nordic language and is supported by the efficiency of a global team.In general, Nordic businesses spend 60-70 per cent of their annual IT budget on running application operations. However, just 30 to 40 per cent of them use it for new development that can support business growth and priorities.Local presence and industry-focused expertise, zero-touch automation approach and global delivery excellence is key for Nordic businesses to achieve operational efficiency across ICT operations and business processes.This approach is specifically suited to businesses designing a service experience for their end users who require a Nordic flavour to their solutions.2. Networked ModelThe networked model builds on the customer-fronting Nordic model and complements it by populating key roles with the best individuals, no matter where they are based. This also allows for multi-cultural and remote environments. The networked model accesses top talent across global locations and allows scalability – even with multiple vendors.This model lets businesses optimise quality and costs alongside flexibility. It is best suited to enterprises that have experience working in multi-cultural environments and need top-notch skills across various implementation phases.3. Industrialized Delivery ModelThe Industrialized Delivery Model prioritizes the scalability of technical skills and the cost-competitiveness aspect of the delivery approach. In order to ensure a fluent flow of information, also customer-facing roles are very often covered from off-shore locations.In certain areas, such as automation competence the best global technology expertise may reside in off-shore locations thus enabling enterprises to secure the benefits of both leading-edge technology and cost competitiveness. This model is best suited to projects where an off-shoring foundation has been already established, thereby giving the customer the combined benefits of low costs and ease of talent availability.Striking the right balanceThe pandemic has taught us that almost everything that can be done remotely will be done remotely. We have seen off-shore and near-shore teams manage high-level design and customer interactions exceptionally well.In our experience, the ideal solution for Nordic customers involves having a networked model that accesses top talent across delivery centers supported by an industrialized model (based on off-shoring with automation baked in) to keep costs in check. This includes tying business solutions brainstormed by those who are very close to the business and customers with enhanced multisite orchestration capabilities to bring in scale.We believe it is possible to get the best of both worlds.Are you interested in knowing more?  We are in a unique position to deliver the optimal mix of these different delivery models based on the needs of our customers.

What to expect from your IT partner,/en/blog/2021/12/what-to-expect-from-your-it-partner/,Digitalization / Pål Remy Østbye / 6.12.2021,"The tricky part comes when it wants a ‘little bit more’ in value to make the company future-proof in an agile, cost-effective, secure and resilient way. This is where the quality and ability of the partner comes in.Here is what you should expect from your future IT partner(s):1. Product+You expect high quality and lower costs. But does that ensure that you can focus on what really matters – i.e. the growth of your business? Perhaps not. Standardization is important when achieving cost-efficiency, but that must not stop you from wanting more. IT has moved from being a support function for business and should now be at the core of every company. This situation will become even more evident over time. So, look for more multi-cloud advisors with state-of-the-art enterprise services and end-to-end solutions.Your partner should be able to assess the ‘business usage’ of technology from your point of view and offer what is best suited to your business – be it Cloud, AI, machine learning, platforms, the Internet of things (IoT) or all of these combined. This result-oriented mindset will help you get more value from the product/service you invest in because your partner will have to maximize IT towards your core business.2. KnowledgeA partner acts as a pilot maneuvering through current and future technologies, based on deep industry and technology knowledge to make sure your business has the competitive advantage.It also plays the role of a trusted advisor and strategic partner, who jointly works with your business (and suppliers) to solve new challenges and meet the digital transformation goals of your enterprise. The partner should also have matured and well-developed relationships with its own vendors. This dimension adds to the technology landscape available.With a good IT supplier, you are on an ongoing and exciting journey of transformation and co-innovation. So, pick a partner who has specific and relevant knowledge, combined with local presence and a global perspective.3. Eco-systemYour partner of choice must be performance-driven and have the ability to work seamlessly in a multi-vendor ecosystem. This requires having agile and flexible development methodologies and modular and scalable system architectures that provide data and cyber security at all times.The objective is to reduce your process turn-around time, improve customer experience, create a great customer journey, increase business uptime, reduce business process complexity and have scope for innovation. A partner who has a DevOps way of working is agile and flexible and can help you achieve that.4. Governance & complianceGood business practices always make great business sense. However, disruption, increasing Cloud maturity and changing geopolitical landscapes have all made information governance a bigger challenge. Therefore, seek out a partner who can help make transparency, security and good governance an integral part of your IT strategy.5. SustainabilityLet’s leave the earth better than we found it for the next generation. Sustainability is good for the planet, for people and for business. Look for partners who help your business achieve sustainable outcomes with innovative solutions and business models. In most cases, these efforts go hand-in-hand with efficient IT solutions.Why TietoEVRY?We’re technology-agnostic! Therefore, our customers can have access to the best solutions in the world. We like to think of ourselves as a spider in a web that can reach out and use different technologies from different companies for the benefit of our customers. We can even combine some of these new technologies into the existing technology platforms of our customers.Additionally, we provide cloud solutions that give our customers a variety of private and multi-cloud opportunities with several vendors, including AWS and Azure, also in combination.

PMC Hydraulics’ successful transformation to a cloud ERP,/en/blog/2021/12/pmc-hydraulics-successful-transformation-to-a-cloud-erp/,Digitalization / Heikki Alho / 2.12.2021,"The successful result was guaranteed by the joint steps taken with Microsoft and TietoEVRY, which had already been discussed and agreed upon before the start of the implementation.PMC Hydraulics is the Nordic leader in innovative hydraulic systems and components for customers in the industrial, energy, mobile, and marine sectors. The company is headquartered in Helsingborg Sweden and has operations in eight countries, five of which were initially upgraded to the cloud ERP.Previously, the company's ERP system was tailored to suit the needs of different operating countries. In the transformation, it was essential to standardise and coordinate the use of ERP in the five countries.We first discussed whether to transform the entire system or whether we would be satisfied with improving our current ERP. The transition to the cloud raised doubts at the beginning, but we decided on this solution because it offers much more development potential in the future, PMC CIO Anders Bäckman explains in the webinar.When the project started three years ago, doubts concerning cloud services were still somewhat justified because of fairly new technology and rapid pace things develop in IT. Now, however, PMC has made the move to cloud services and that have proven that these concerns were unfounded. In addition to enterprise-level processes and functionalities, Microsoft cloud services have evolved as the most trusted and secure platform in the market, emphasizes Senior Technical Specialist at Microsoft Antti Koikkalainen.Together with system vendor Microsoft and consulting partner TietoEVRY, PMC decided to upgrade the ERP system to Microsoft Dynamics 365 cloud service. It was clear to all three parties where we are heading as a company and which steps to take to accommodate this growth. A consensus was soon formed as a team and with a common understanding, it was easy to start implementing the plan, says Heikki Alho, Head of Microsoft Dynamics Global at TietoEVRY.Cooperation between the parties worked through dialogue and discussion. It was critical that all business representatives were involved in the discussions from the beginning and that all PMC stakeholders and partners understood that the goal is to harmonise operations.Eight months of effortThe whole process took eight months. On TietoEVRY's side, about ten experts were involved in the implementation. On PMC’s side, the project involved about 30 people – in addition to IT experts, administration staff and naturally, the main users of the ERP.Microsoft contributed to the rapid implementation of the project.We want to be there with our clients when the services are implemented. We will meet with the parties and share best practices for implementation. All of us at Microsoft are there making sure that everything goes according to expectations and that the best features are included, says Antti Koikkalainen.Heikki Alho of TietoEVRY emphasizes that cloud-based ERP is not functionally that different, but the entire set-up and system creation are different from those in on-prem. Despite the scale of the project, deployment progressed smoothly in five countries, thanks to the dialogue with all parties.The client was adamant that we have to stick to the standard solution in the solution modelling phase. With wide implementation in five countries, there were only 13 modifications, that's all, he says.I have been involved in many global ERP and IT projects in general, but they have rarely been as successful as this joint project, Anders Bäckman says.Not by forcing but by discussion and realisationHowever, it was hard work to get everyone in five different countries to buy into the transformation - this was achieved not by dictating, but by communicating and helping people to understand that this is the best possible solution.Bäckman says that the challenge was by no means the technology, but the biggest effort was made to get everyone to accept the cloud transformation and understand what we were doing. After all, the functionalities for the end-user are the same.The IT department is not the primary user of the ERP, it is principally used by the owners of the various processes and people working in the business units, so they must be motivated to develop their skills and learn.CIO Anders Bäckman lists four key factors for success:Mindset, what you want to achieve and having staff commitment to the transformation
Understanding what we already have and what we really require in the new ERP system
TietoEVRY also had clear goals for what we needed at PMC. No changes were made to the standard solution without prior agreement with company representatives.
Cloud-based ERP with new features available on a fast scheduleThe transformation is the starting point for future development. The next steps include the implementation of the new ERP to three of our eight other operating countries, says Anders Bäckman.The transition to the cloud is constantly paving the way for new solutions and upgrades as we evolve, concludes Heikki Alho of TietoEVRY.", Heikki Alho ,Digitalization , 2.12.2021
7 criteria for building a successful central payments infrastructure for real-time payments,/en/blog/2021/12/7-criteria-for-building-a-successful-central-payments-infrastructure-for-real-time-payments/,Digitalization / Edgars Bremze  / 2.12.2021,"1. Take a user-first approachWhen developing an infrastructure, it’s essential to consider services that will be offered to users over time, therefore having a long-term view is essential. Adding additional capabilities to an existing infrastructure, that could have been incorporated at launch, adds complexity and costs that are avoidable with a user-first approach. For example, functionality such as request-to-pay should be built into the core infrastructure of any modern central payment infrastructure from the beginning.A good example of this is the US instant payment system, FedNow, where a rich feature set and expansive functions will be built into the core platform, which is scheduled for launch in 2023.2. Drive adoption with an open ecosystemCentral infrastructure must be flexible enough to respond to the evolving needs of both businesses and their customers. Providing accessibility via APIs and leveraging international standards, such as ISO20022, will enable payment service providers, banks and other financial institutions to connect to the system easily and structure their offering. This will encourage market participants to innovate and deliver new and better services to users, resulting in faster instant payment adoption.For example, to ease the access to the instant payments system in the Maldives, we are creating a Unified Payment Gateway (UPG) that will act as an API based access layer to unite all modules of the solution. UPG will enable customers to manage multiple payment accounts through a single interface, including seamless fund routing and merchant payments.3. Strive for interoperabilityToday’s payment system is fragmented. Different payment systems cannot easily communicate with one another. To meet customer needs, merchants have to offer customers multiple payments methods, which creates additional costs. Furthermore, if different payment platforms are interoperable, consumers could benefit from making instant transfers to each other among these platforms. Utilizing industry standards that support interoperability, such as ISO 20022, can help to resolve the fragmentation and support interoperability.4. Embrace cross-border paymentsThis year, the G20 has made cross-border payments a priority to address cost, speed, transparency and access challenges, in a move that will have significant ramifications for the industry. Looking further afield, an agreement between the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Bank of Thailand allows users of Singapore's PayNow and Thailand's PromptPay to send up to S$1,000 or THB25,000 daily between the two countries using only a mobile number. These trends, as well as cross-border initiatives such as P27 Nordic Payments and the European Payments Initiative, should be embraced.The market demand exists, it’s about looking into cross-border instant payments and envisioning how a local central payment scheme can communicate with another instant payment scheme. Again, common industry standards should be used to ensure its success.5. Utilize governance frameworksGiven that the adoption of instant payments is speeding up, it’s likely that they will replace traditional payment systems. As this adoption grows, it’s essential that the regulations and governance frameworks are in place to support and promote this. Rather than being seen as a hindrance to growth and business, they should define the operating models that support the secure and sustainable environments for service providers to thrive, while protecting customers and businesses. With intuitive frameworks in place, all stakeholders will be able to move forward with confidence.6. Negate AML and fraud scoringAML and fraud scoring are major challenges for banks, especially in the context of instant payments. Negating them is critical. This should be addressed at an industry level, whereby information on such matters as suspicious accounts and networks are shared between banks. As an example, the UK’s Faster Payments system is designed to identify and alert members about fraudulent account networks. Depending on the market, the necessary additional transaction monitoring and blocking of suspicious accounts could be managed by a central bank, central monitoring authority or a central payment processor. For success, the necessary processes, rulebooks and information exchange protocols must be established.7. Think digital, think mobile deviceDigital payments and e-commerce are on the rise, in part driven by our increased dependence on mobile devices, which is why many service providers turn to apps. When Sweden introduced Swish, the mobile instant payments platform, they went for a common, user-friendly mobile app supported by banks in the country. To meet customer demand for simple, secure and immediate mobile payment solutions, Bizum in Spain also launched a P2P payment app – a service consumers now use on a day-to-day basis.Where to startBuilding this type of infrastructure is a large investment requiring extensive resources, therefore we always advise our clients to investigate existing infrastructure projects deployed around the world and learn from them. If you are unsure where to start, we are ready to share best practice examples and use-cases and guide you in the right direction.Learn more: Instant Payments Infrastructure", Edgars Bremze  ,Digitalization , 2.12.2021

"S/4HANA authorizations – validate the old, bring in the new",/en/blog/2021/11/s4hana-authorizations--validate-the-old-bring-in-the-new/,Digitalization / Emilia Korhonen / 29.11.2021,"However, since the change to S/4HANA is a totally new product rather than a version upgrade or an extension to the existing system, it is even more important to carefully review your existing authorizations concept and optimize it for security and usability.SAP S/4HANA uses the same security model as traditional ABAP SAP applications. Users are still assigned PFCG roles in SU01 in the same way, but in addition to this, access to Fiori also needs to be maintained. For your security team, this added layer has the potential to make access maintenance more complex and prone to errors. So even if parts of your existing authorization concept are still valid, adaptation to meet new requirements is needed. A well-functioning and carefully designed authorization concept will not only increase system security and make user and role maintenance easier, but it will also help users to have a positive experience with the new S/4HANA system – and therefore have a positive impact on their attitude towards the change.For more on Fiori user management and authorization check the SAP Help Portal: User Management and AuthorizationThe amount of effort needed to make authorization changes will depend on how the new system is designed to be used. If the plan is to continue using GUI (the traditional graphical user interface client in SAP) and only implement minimal Fiori use you will need to do at least the following:Review the impacts on existing authorizations based on SAP’s Simplification List of upcoming changes; these impacts can include things like transactions becoming obsolete or being substituted by a new transaction or a Fiori app.
Set up authorizations in the new system including SU24 (maintenance of authorization defaults).
Migrate roles and adapt them with new content, or define and build new roles; remember to document all role changes.
Migrate existing and create new users as needed; this applies to both business and technical users.
Plan, execute, and support different levels of authorization (role) testing, and plan and execute issue resolution; again, remember to document all testing and issue resolution procedures. Also, remember to include negative testing (testing that users can’t see anything they are not authorized to see or execute any actions they are not authorized to perform).
Train new users and establish good communications with the whole user base.
Make sure you have a solid go-live plan including user role assignments and communicate access details to users.
Create a robust plan for support after go-live and a plan for handover to continuous support.
Plan rollback scenarios for authorizations and how to provide emergency access (SAP_ALL no longer works for everything).
If you are using a governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) tool, adjust the access control ruleset to include S4 and Fiori rules to make sure you do not lose visibility over risks in false Check out SAP’s YouTube channel for more information: SAP GRC solutions and SAP S/4HANA
Update or create authorization concept documentationThe list above can make the amount of work seem overwhelming considering that authorizations are only one part of the project. The good thing is that there are SAP guidelines to follow and experts available to help you break down even the biggest projects into understandable and manageable tasks.Below are some essentials to bear in mind:Include authorization in your S/4HANA project plan right from the start. If users can’t access the functionality they need or perform their tasks the new system will be useless. On the other hand, if the access given is too wide (the quick and dirty access solution) there is a risk of unintentional misuse, intentional fraud, or at the very least red flags from auditors.
Put serious effort into testing. Carefully consider who should do it and what needs to be tested. Please note that issue resolution for authorizations is more complex in S/4HANA than in a traditional SAP system. Allow plenty of time for retesting after issues are resolved and for discussion with business experts since authorizations issues are not always just technical but sometimes need business decision making and policy definitions.
Speak to your SAP authorization expert about recommendations and best practices. There is no need to reinvent the wheel.", Emilia Korhonen ,Digitalization , 29.11.2021
Putting trust to the test – Tietoevry employees choose hybrid work,/en/blog/2021/11/putting-trust-to-the-test--tietoevry-employees-choose-hybrid-work/,Meet our people / Trond Vinje / 26.11.2021,"Some of these plans seem surprisingly restrictive to me, especially given the opportunities technology provides and the smart new ways of working we have created over the past 18 months.The way we build the future of work has a massive impact not only on the employee experience, but also on the customer experience and on sustainability. Our future ways of working can cause people to either love us, or leave us.How our colleagues co-created the futureTietoevry’s values are openness, trust and diversity. To stay true to these, we invited all our 24,000 employees to co-create our future ways of working.During early 2021, employees from around the world shared their views and ideas through workshops and a crowdsourcing survey. We asked what had surprised them about working from home, how remote work has affected collaboration with customers and colleagues, how they see our future ways of working in a post-pandemic world, and how (or where) they would like to work in the future.With the survey bringing in 43,000 comments from almost 8,000 participants – and with hundreds of employees participating in the workshops – we can say with conviction that people want to contribute to planning for the company’s future! After all, what we decide today can have a big impact on each of our personal and professional lives tomorrow.What did we learn from our employees?“Some people cannot connect remotely, yet others fall in love on the internet. So it's obvious we are different.”As captured by this quote from one of our workshops, we are all refreshingly different as to where and how we want to work.Our survey revealed that the majority of employees (40%) would like to come to the office for 1-2 days per week – mainly for social reasons. The remaining 60% are quite evenly split between those who would like to come to the office on most or all workdays, would like to visit the office less than once a week, or would like to work fully remotely.From these findings, it became clear that our future ways of working need to be flexible enough to meet everyone’s needs.At Tietoevry, the future of work is hybrid – a combination of remote work and officesWe want to respect the diversity of our employees’ opinions by offering as much flexibility as possible, and by not forcing a set number of days at the office. Flexibility means more personal responsibility, but we trust our people to judge how to balance their own needs with those of our customers and their teams.We have guidelines for our common ways of working, and we closely follow local regulations and customer requirements. We invite employees and teams to openly discuss what hybrid means for you, as we invest in leadership training, support for remote work, more functional office spaces, and digital collaboration tools.Hybrid work is a true test of trust and leadership, and we are ready to learn along the way. Whether you are a customer today or an employee of the future, we welcome you to join Tietoevry on our hybrid journey!Are you interested in a career at Tietoevry?

RPA Solutions for SAP SuccessFactors,/en/blog/2021/11/rpa-solutions-for-sap-successfactors/,Digitalization / Rohit Bindroo / 25.11.2021,"Let´s get inspired by use cases of our customers who already implemented solutions based on Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to their SAP SuccessFactors environment. Read the stories below to understand when RPA-based solutions enable you to run the HXM processes more efficiently, while reducing the manual maintenance efforts required from HR administrators.1. OffboardingWhen it comes to offboarding tasks, many steps need to be taken and must be well-orchestrated to complete the process successfully. Administrators have to follow up with managers, update multiple systems, manually create and cross-verify various documents, and update any future-dated irrelevant records. We see that complex process often results in causing pain points to our customers until we propose and implement the automation. Our RPA solutions, tailored around SuccessFactors, help customers to take care of the entire offboarding of the terminated employees. After receiving a trigger from Employee Central (EC), the RPA process starts automatically on the initiation of termination. Here is the gist of what tasks are performed by the robot:After receiving a trigger from SuccessFactors EC, the robot checks employee records and accordingly informs various departments (Finance/IT/Payroll) by raising tickets/alerts/workflows in tools/applications like service now etc.
The robot sends a notification to HR Admins/Managers and other stakeholders.
The robot generates service documents/experience letters and other related documents for the terminated employee to be shared by the HR Admin.
The robot checks the progress of workflows and accordingly intimates various approvers for pending tasks.
The robot checks the future dated records and deletes them to ensure no impact on payroll and time off.
The robot sends updates to the active directory for stopping access on the date of termination for a terminated employee.
Most importantly, the robot not only performs these tasks, but at the same time monitors their progress, and alerts HR administrators or other stakeholders of missing tasks or missing information.2. Recruiting postingsAs soon as HR managers/Recruiters approve the Job Requisitions, the next steps usually involve posting the Job Requisition, reposting, or removing job ads from the career site. This again often results in a lot of manual efforts from Recruiters/Admins. Imagine how the efficiency improves, when the RPA solution automates the process as soon as the requisition is approved. Here are a few details of what the robot does:The robot reads the requisitions and posts the jobs to the internal career site, external career site, or the Job Boards.
The robot maintains the end date for postings based on the information in the requisition.
The robot checks the published job advertisement on Career sites and informs the recruiters when these become available.
The robot also creates and sends the XML feeds to the agencies/partners not available on the SuccessFactors Job Boards marketplace.
The robot receives messages from a recruiter about removing/ending any job ads postings via email, and accordingly removes the Job posts.3. Manage pending RecruitsOnce candidates from Onboarding/Recruiting move to Manage Pending Recruits Pool, the RPA solution will also provide a lot of value by performing the following tasks:The robot reads the manage pending recruits pool and validates the data from onboarding/recruiting.
The robot initiates the hiring process for the candidate and fills in the missing information.
The robot sends the notification to HR admins and other stakeholders after the completion of hiring.
The robot updates the active directory or sends information to any other IDP for access.
The robot creates the tickets in the corporate service desk tools to IT department/finance/procurement for assignment of workstation and other equipment.
The robot maintains the documents collected from the candidate during onboarding or recruiting in relevant sections of the employee's profile. Documents like work permits, authorization letters, clearance letters, experience letters, offer letters, education certificates and others.4. Documentation/workbooksAnother use case for our RPA solutions is maintaining the customers´ SuccessFactors workbooks and related documents. Robot reads/checks the system setup and accordingly updates the configurations workbooks. Especially for customers having extensive Role-Based Permissions in the system, Robots make it much easier to understand the setup as it formats and makes the information available in easy-to-read and visual formats.5. Mass changesThere are many objects for which we don’t have any easy options to carry mass updates in SuccessFactors. Our RPA solutions will help you with such tasks.Are you aiming to make your HR digital transformation journey smooth and efficient?

Time to get the full benefits of utilizing the Public Cloud as an SAP platform,/en/blog/2020/11/sap-on-public-cloud-hold-your-horses/,Cloud / Pete Nieminen / 23.11.2021,"At the Nordic level, we were standing behind. Maybe the reason was our very early adaptations of the Public Cloud, which were mostly lift and shift-projects to the early, very different from now cloud services. Back then, most benefits were left unclaimed and unreachable, decision makes were disappointed. Lack of knowledge or unwillingness to listen to the experts was the most common reason for failure.Even Gartner found out, re-visiting their research for Public Cloud infrastructure, that cost-efficiency if achievable usually in two years, but even in properly made transformation can still come up as negative ROI.For me, this just emphasizes that cost savings cannot be the only or even the primary reason for entirely new infrastructure.During the past ten years, Public Cloud has evolved exponentially. Terms like infinite scale, could native, always-up-to-date, Cloud DevOps and Cloud FinOps and many more hypes raised, but the actual business benefits were also within reach. I call this the second coming of the Public Cloud. This time, supporting the business is the key.Last year, I was able to list around 50 unique benefits for utilizing Public Cloud as an SAP platform. To mention a few:Extremely reliable, certified infrastructure with global reach
High-fidelity, on-demand platforms and services with automation
Infrastructure as a code enabling fast deployment and support operations with minimum or no downtime
Cost efficiencies due to on-demand infrastructure, multiple licensing possibilities and implementation and optimisation models
Last but not least, scalability, including for business.Scalable IT infrastructure is nice, but achieving a truly scalable business is excellence.Advantages of utilizing the Public Cloud as an SAP platform are indisputableThe technical, financial and business advantages are substantial. Unpredictable costs and huge capital expenses can now be transformed into operating expenses. First time ever, you can actually downscale and not only upscale your ERP costs during the long contract period. Even SAP itself predicts that more than 3/4 of its customers will choose Public Cloud as the next platform.So why should you: ""hold your horses""? Is there something wrong with the concept? No, and not because this is a big decision. There are over 5.000 organizations that have already made it. Most of them fully successful and getting full benefits. I am worried about those who are NOT getting the full benefits.Now when most of the enterprises have realized, that utilizing the Public Cloud as an SAP platform is an excellent idea for both business and IT, the organizations started rushing in. The future or present requirement for S/4 HANA is also accelerating the need for platform change.It is true that so many have done the migration to Public Cloud already, that probably no deep discovery and project planning phase is needed (note that I am talking about the BASIS migration now, not SAP applications) since the migration process is quite straightforward for those with enough experience on it.There are many things that affect the success of the migration and the final business transformation.First of all, this is a business project and not an IT project. Why? Because of the old principles of governance (including sourcing), architectures and best practices do not apply anymore.
Secondly, the direct cost savings is only a fracture of the full business benefits available.
Thirdly, Public Cloud, SAP and Cybersecurity is a combination where all parts require a new kind of understanding of the new ecosystem. There is also a great variety of Public Clouds and SAP cloud-based applications which need to be evaluated.There are the skills, tools and experience, so what am I worrying about? The rush. Previously I mentioned that the old ""ways"" do not apply anymore. Many of the organizations planning for the migration do not realize that they want the RFI's, RFP's and whatever answered in a week or two. Why? Because that's the way it has always been done.If you want everything to be done 1:1 it still does not work that way. Even with experience, automation and straightforward processes, you cannot do SAP on Public Cloud as a 1:1 migration. If you could, you would lose all possible benefits and pay too much from the beginning with never getting to any kind of break-even in costs - and you can't do even that, since most of the principles are not the same. You need to plan the strategy, start the journey with migration and establish a roadmap for controlled and measured business transformation.Learn more on on the subject of SAP on Public Cloud here.", Pete Nieminen ,Cloud , 23.11.2021
5 tips for a secure online shopping experience,/en/blog/2021/11/5-tips-for-a-secure-online-shopping-experience/,Cybersecurity insights / Oskar Ehrnström / 23.11.2021,"This is also a buffet table for cybercriminals. False web pages that capture credit card information, fraud, phishing, fake shopping sites, etc. are created to exploit people's fears and goodwill, to steal their personal information.So, in addition to checking the balance on your credit card and writing shopping lists, you also need to take certain security precautions before going into e-shopping mode. If done correctly, shopping online is convenient and easy – and safe.5 tips on how to make your online shopping a bit safer1. Pay attention to the networkIf you are not at home, pay attention to which wifi you are connecting to. Do you have the tendency of connecting to free wifi? If is it called ""Free Wifi"" or something similar, then you should consider whether to do shopping on that network. It may be a criminal who set up the wifi network to listen to your traffic and capture your personal information. And never use public computers for online shopping.2. Select apps with careDid you know that there are fake apps that mimic the official Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker to take advantage of our interest in Corona? Carefully review what permissions an app requires. Is it really necessary for an app that presents a visualization of the global distribution of the new Coronavirus, to have access to your pictures, GPS position, camera, and contacts? Some apps even want permission to record every keystroke on your phone. That includes any credentials or credit cards data typed.3. Surf safelyMake sure your devices are up to date and protected with commercial security products. For example, a security product may contain virus protection, firewall with intrusion protection, web filter, and phishing protection. A trustworthy VPN service is also a good option if you have to use public networks.When you need to make online payments, make sure it is https://www.shop.com and not http://www.shop.com. It will also appear as a small padlock in the address bar.4. Be careful of unknown online storesIf you shop in an online store that's new to you, there are things to keep in mind. In times of crisis, also many fraudulent online shops have appeared those market facemasks, hand sanitizers and other medical supplies. Even if the website appears trustworthy, you should check if the company exists or delivers the goods you have intended to buy.Do not click on banners in emails or on the web if you are not completely sure that the sender is legitimate. Before you click, hover over the banner and review the link. You will then be able to read the entire address. Does the address look strange (for example, contains many special characters or some letters that have been replaced)? If yes, do not click. When looking for what you want to buy, check out the ratings and reviews of the online store on a couple of different external sites.Other things like poor language or exceptionally attractive offers are also signals that you should listen to.5. Secure paymentThe webshop should use secure payments together with Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Swish, and/or direct payment from the online bank. And don’t forget to check your bank account statement to look for deviant transactions.Remember these simple tips, and you can proceed with your online shopping securely.Take the test!Are you able to detect what's wrong with these addresses?www.kjeII.comHere is the lower case L changed to the upper case I. When written in all upper-case, it actually looks like this: WWW.KJEII.COMdhl.amazondeliveryservice.comIt’s easy to think that this is a legitimate site to track your delivery, but it’s probably a site that distributes malware. Go through the shop site or the logistics site to track your delivery.www.ritua.lsHere, the Lesothic top-level domain is used to trick the reader into believing that the link leads to Rituals official website (www.rituals.com).

Cloud security ABC (part II) - How to hide from hackers,/en/blog/2021/11/cloud-security-abc-how-to-hide-from-hackers/,Cloud / Toni Kuokkanen / 19.11.2021,"A core part of cloud security is limiting the resources that are visible to the outside world – in other words, the internet. Leave doors wide open and your services will more than likely attract the attention of hackers. It’s time to prepare for a security breach.The “bad guys” use automation to snoop around, so they don't really lack the resources or time needed to steal your data and then turn a quick profit by selling it to the highest bidder on the darknet. So, you need to do a scan to verify what you are exposing to the internet –something that is often overlooked, leading to some embarrassing newspaper headlines. Doing a pen test or red team exercise isn’t a bad idea either.There are lots of tools for scanning, and some cloud-native tools do an OK job. Just remember to scan your systems regularly so you always know what’s happening. The same rule of thumb that applies to traditional IT security applies in the cloud: you are only as secure as your weakest link. We, humans, are usually the weakest link in any security system because social engineering can circumvent lots of security protocols. Fewer humans equal fewer problems so, as far as you can, you should replace manual steps with automation.Here are some practical tips on how to enhance cloud security:1. Secure your key management, when automating infrastructure. There should be no human-readable keys; instead, a service account should be the only way to access the infrastructure.2. Enable multifactor authentication because it doesn’t require any additional steps or complicated configuration work and it will eliminate a lot of possible negative outcomes.3. Read and write access rights in storage need to be examined meticulously to ensure they are secure. Overlooking is one of the most common reasons data gets stolen. This applies to databases too. A recent high-profile example of such a breach is the Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB leak where customers’ private keys were leaked. This vulnerability went unnoticed for a long period of time.4. Make sure your applications are not directly visible to the outside world by protecting them with an application gateway (Azure), Cloud Load Balancing (Google Cloud Platform), or an Application Load Balancer (Amazon Web Services). This makes it easier to manage the traffic coming to your service and makes it possible to block potentially malicious traffic.5. Keep it simple. When building cloud infra, complexity is your enemy. This is because when you don't know what you’re doing you tend to implement unnecessarily complex solutions that have a higher chance of being misconfigured, which can lead to potential attacks. In cloud terms, this is common sense, and skilled cloud engineers can be a huge asset in this regard.6. Train your users properly. As already mentioned, we humans are often the weakest link in the chain. Phishing and configuration errors are common causes of security breaches, and you can mitigate risk by training your staff well and keeping them up to date.A lot of cloud security articles focus on the technical aspects, which are of course important, but I like to talk about the human factor, as social engineering and plain old silly mistakes are often the cause of those “oopsie” moments. People are a company’s greatest asset, but if they are not treated right or not trained to do their job properly, they are also its weakest link.Building a cloud team that can lay a solid foundation and automation stack is a must for any company that is looking to stay safe and stay relevant.Time to talk about cloud security - Cloud security ABC (part I)", Toni Kuokkanen ,Cloud , 19.11.2021

The bumpy road towards a software-defined vehicle,/en/blog/2021/11/the-bumpy-road-towards-a-software-defined-vehicle/,Digitalization / Mikel Echegoyen / 18.11.2021,"Software is the heart of the modern car experience, making rides more comfortable, safer, less polluting, and adding new services over the lifetime of the vehicle. Executives in the automotive industry highlight that “Software will account for 90% of future innovations in the car” (Herbert Dies, Volkswagen Chairman).The increasingly complex automotive software environmentModern vehicles have over 100 ECUs (Electronic Control Units), altogether comprising 100 million lines of source code. Each new functionality for safety, comfort, infotainment, and personalization introduces additional electronics and components – and adds a large set of new software. This software requires extra development, integration, and quality assurance effort towards SOP (start of Production), and poses additional challenges to ensure software maintenance on a very long lifecycle and perform software updates.But this is just part of the puzzle. Different regional regulatory requirements, increasing options to fit individual car owner preferences, and evolving models to cater to market demands lead to large variations of configurations, trims, and models, which add another dimension to the complexity. The explosion of combinations means that not every configuration can be tested and verified in practice.Vehicle recall data for 2019 in the USA reveals that while the number of vehicle recalls has decreased, software-based defects are increasing. More software is needed to detect abnormalities, add reliability, and ensure quality and conformance to safety standards. On the positive side, software-based remedies have been used for many mechanical or electronic faults that would have required repair or replacement of vehicle components in the past.Becoming software-centric requires as much brains as musclesOver the years, Automotive OEMs have not been hands-on developing most of this software themselves. They have relied on tens of suppliers to provide the bulk of the software. Now, the situation is changing. OEMs are increasingly building their software engineering teams and practices – and driving further standardization either within their groups (e.g., CARIAD in the Volkswagen group), or through industry alliances such as AUTOSAR and COVESA (formerly GENIVI).Software complexity in vehicles is rapidly outpacing the ability to both develop and maintain it, but software engineering productivity is not growing nearly as fast. Just like the Red Queen in Lewis Carrol’s Through the Looking Glass, the automotive industry has realized that “It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place”. Delivering on the software-defined vehicle requires the industry to run smarter rather than running harder.We work with OEMs as a software engineering partner. Not only to scale their engineering, but also to adopt best practices in software development, DevOps, and Agile methods. Our experience in solving similar software complexity, scale, and re-use challenges also in other industries is instrumental to a successful transition to a software-centric automotive industry.Tips to “run smarter” towards software-defined vehiclesCentralize ECUs to reduce complexity: Consolidating Multiple ECUs into domain area ECUs reduces the amount of wiring, networked communication, and simplifies software development and upgrades.Use Closed-Loop SiL (Software in the Loop) for continuous integration and validation: Having the ability to test with software allows adding scale, frequency, and variation to the testing, complementing other testing techniques such as HiL (Hardware in the Loop), DiL (Drive in the Loop), and ViL (Vehicle in the Loop), which require physical elements that are harder to scale.Architect Over the Air updates (OTA) into the software lifecycle: Software updates to support variants, updates in security and defects, and adding new features and services are all very desirable, but they require rock-solid SW delivery, security, safety, rollback mechanisms and non-intrusive user experience (who wants to wait 10+ minutes for an update to be completed to be able to start the car?). This needs to be designed into the system-level software architecture as it spans both in-vehicle, vehicle to cloud, and cloud domains.Harmonize safety and security related development practices across the supply chain and use standardized quality metrics: while many standards for safety are commonplace in the automotive industry (such as ASPICE MISRA, ISO 26262) their adoption into engineering and DevOps practices varies greatly across the supply chain. In security, standards such as ISO/SAE 21434 (Road vehicles – Cybersecurity Engineering) and UNECE WP.29 (Regulation on Cybersecurity) don’t define details. This leaves room for different approaches in threat modelling, secure coding, secure design, DevSecOps practices – and degrees of quality across the software value chain.Learn more about how we help automotive companies to ""run smarter"" towards software-defined vehicles.", Mikel Echegoyen ,Digitalization , 18.11.2021
Time to redefine data management in cloud,/en/blog/2021/11/time-to-redefine-data-management-in-cloud/,Data / Emmanuel Raymond / 17.11.2021,"Winning the 2021 Microsoft Partner of the Year award in Finland and delivering the first global training for the new Cloud data management capabilities (CDMC, from EDM Council) together with Microsoft and a few others were key milestones for us – but what does it mean to our customers?During the last 12 months, we ran hundreds of meetings with Microsoft and worked with the best cloud data management specialists around the world. This blog offers my perspective on why we did that work and on what this work means for our customer’s journey to the cloud.For many of our customers, the cloud transformation is already well underway, and as part of the biggest Microsoft Azure community serving the Nordics, TietoEVRY is the natural partner to support that move. As we bring the best technology to our customers, they will not miss the opportunity to improve data management or to drive automation to improve data quality and secure data consistency across their new hybrid landscapes.Expectations for insights and data qualityAs more and more companies start to run their business in the cloud, many are realizing that the move represents a unique opportunity to take a closer look at what is there and do some housekeeping. This is a good time to remove obsolete applications and outdated architectures, adopt modern automation technologies, and “reboot” their data management practices to secure their investments, for example.Bringing the latest cloud technologies to our customers has also helped us to understand those cost savings can only be gained when these other elements are in place. New definitions of what good data looks like in the cloud have emerged and our customers’ perspectives have evolved.The move to the cloud is a unique opportunity to move away from a fragmented data environment towards a more controlled one. The cloud ambition and promise are not just to help with the data that is moved to the cloud but also to address the issues that remain in the legacy systems.Data inventories in the cloud will map data in other clouds and in on-premises systems. And the data lifecycles and data quality topics that benefit from these modern technologies have the ambition to cover the full scope.Cloud transformation is a catalyst for collaborationThe time has come to realize that the cloud is not just resources that grow or shrink but actually a means to foster collaboration within companies.Individual business functions within an organization are increasingly interested in the meaning of the data. At a time when knowledge is more fragmented than ever, the cloud can also represent an opportunity to unify different knowledge areas under a common representation of reality and foster new levels of innovation.As companies move to the cloud, we now have a new framework defining what “good” looks like. Cloud transformation accelerates new data approaches and new automation technologies that will motivate everyone to manage data in a meaningful way.Moving to the cloud is all about our customers and how we can better support you in your change journey.

"A positive environment, great colleagues, and exciting opportunities made me return to Tietoevry",/en/blog/2021/11/a-positive-environment-great-colleagues-and-exciting-opportunities-made-me-return-to-tietoevry/,Meet our people / Sanna  Beilinson / 16.11.2021,"One of the most memorable interactions during my four years at Tietoevry was when my manager asked me, “Sanna, what kind of project would you like to be involved with next? What would support your personal development?”Those questions embody the principles by which I have progressed in my career – and what is best at Tietoevry, the company is an enabler. The rest is really up to you.A short break made me appreciate the colleagues and opportunities at TietoevryI came to Tietoevry in 2017 through a Young Professionals program as an SAP consultant, practically joining an entirely new industry. I have a master’s degree in Economics and Business Administration and previous experience in management consulting and project management – but not in IT. I’ve always been passionate about learning and embracing new things, so at Tietoevry I quickly progressed into project management, and after a few years, I became the Delivery Lead of Public Cloud Finland.Last spring, I decided to accept an interesting offer from another company, but I soon started missing the strong work community and the opportunities at Tietoevry. After six months, I returned to Tietoevry in a new role in developing new public cloud services. I was a bit nervous about how I would be welcomed as a returnee, but the reception from both coworkers and clients was extremely warm. Microsoft Finland choosing Tietoevry as Partner of the Year in 2021 also showed that our hard work was paying off and this further validated my decision to come back. It was clear I had made the right decision.Awesome coworkers and supportive work environment is often taken for granted. I think Tietoevry’s atmosphere and work community is very rare. We have a strong drive to move forward, develop, and be the best in the market. In addition, I have also always felt I am supported, and we are always willing to help each other.Not all projects are right for your career, so choose the ones that areAt Tietoevry, we have different learning paths for different roles, but we can also influence our own paths. You only need to have the courage to ask in order to grow. We have a lot of training opportunities to choose from —including customized ones - and capability development is highly supported. Here, those who are ambitious and willing to work hard, are noticed and in my experience, are also given the opportunity to advance their careers. I have always been able to join interesting initiatives, and this is also how I have been able to continuously develop myself.Our Cloud Anywhere unit particularly emphasizes self-management, which can also sometimes be challenging. When opportunities are made available, you must be careful with taking on too much. On the other hand, in my own experience, Tietoevry leaders also support in selecting work that is beneficial for your personal growth. “Sanna, there’s a project available, but it would not help you grow,” is something one of my managers told me, which left a lasting impression.Right now, we are looking for a Cloud Advisor to join our team – in case I got you interested don't hesitate to be in touch and apply!To stay on top, you need to have a mindset of growthMy role in the Cloud Anywhere unit is to identify and develop new business opportunities and services for customers. Public cloud is a fast-growing and fast-evolving business, and you must have almost a start-up -like mindset in order to stay up-to-date. I feel that at Tietoevry, I get the opportunity to truly work with something new as well as have an impact in how we operate internally.I don’t want to sell products to customers; I want to offer them solutions with true value. This, I feel is also the principle and the collective goal of Tietoevry. My experience on the delivery side also helps me to understand what is realistic. I don’t like overpromising, which is why I sometimes need to disagree with a customer. However, I strongly believe that exactly those honest interactions are the ones that increase trust between us.In the end, it is working with great people that inspires me the most. I enjoy being able to genuinely help customers in their businesses. I am motivated by learning and making a difference, whether it is by supporting a co-worker’s well-being or a successful delivery to a customer.Sign up to our Women in Tech breakfast date where Sanna will be sharing insights on how cloud affects the way we all work Sign up hereWe are hiring all the time, so please check out for our open positions here and apply now!", Sanna  Beilinson ,Meet our people , 16.11.2021
Happy teams at DNA and TietoEVRY,/en/blog/2021/10/happy-teams-at-dna-and-tietoevry/,Digitalization / Milla Rosenholm / 15.11.2021,"Balanced team dynamicsThe importance of curating the perfect combination of skills and personality traits within a team was recognized early on as the main success factor in the long-lasting and fruitful collaboration between TietoEVRY and DNA. When the first agile team started working on DNA's B2C webstore seven years ago, a lot of effort was put into choosing exactly the right people for the job. It wasn't enough for a candidate to master the required technical skills; their personality had to fit the rest of the team. This approach has been used successfully ever since, with both TietoEVRY and DNA carefully evaluating all new hires to ensure the team dynamics remain balanced.Less bureaucracy, smoother workdaysThe work does not end there, though. There are hiccups in communication, differences in how people react to stress, and opposing views on solutions. Our full-time project managers and scrum masters dedicate a significant chunk of their time to ensure smooth workdays for everyone. Sometimes this means facilitating discussions between people with different ways of communicating, or protecting team members from the unwanted bureaucracy that is an inevitable part of working for a big company. The main objective is to make sure people feel satisfied with their working life and that they want to stay in the DNA project.Continuous learningWith their long-term assignments at DNA, TietoEVRY team members have a shared interest in customer success. Dedicated, vertical teams have vast domain knowledge about complicated telecom products and services and can solve issues independently. The evolving architectural target state and updated technology choices for DNA online development keep the work interesting and provide possibilities for growth and learning – a major factor highlighted by our developers when interviewed about the DNA project.Moving towards a microservices architecture and modern frontends with highly available and scalable test and production environments, through AWS Cloud Computing resources, has enabled fast experiments, left-shifted testing, rolling deployments, and the ability to release features on-demand. Even though the evolution from Java monolith deployments to the current state with fully automated CI/CD pipelines has been challenging and time consuming, the benefits are indisputable.From the viewpoint of a developer, the operational complexity and risks for the team are lower when using AWS Managed Services. Also, seeing your changes in production the same day you have written the code increases motivation and instills a sense of responsibility for the overall solution.In a working environment that values and encourages continuous learning, new technologies and ways of working have been taken into use. A good example of the expertise and eagerness to learn and utilize cutting-edge knowledge and best practice coming together can be seen in the Oma DNA mobile application, which truly sets the standard for intuitive customer experience in the telecom industry today.A happy team has a great balance of both skills and personalities.Virtual and collaborativeTietoEVRY’s development teams at DNA consist of people working from Finland, Poland, and Serbia, and everyone is equally important regardless of their geographical location or role in the team. With years of experience in online collaboration and inclusive participation, the impact of COVID-19 on everyday work wasn’t that severe for TietoEVRY teams at DNA as online tools for participation and knowledge sharing had already been widely used well before the pandemic. Mutual respect and a supportive team spirit, together with common ways of working and a shared time zone, make teamwork flow effortlessly.Even complex events such as SAFe PI planning are nowadays conducted entirely online. Visual online collaboration tools have proven to be a very useful addition to the virtual participation toolbox already in use.Fun at workWouldn't it be nice to go to work in the morning and meet your friends there? Over the years, we have witnessed plenty of friendships forming between people working on the same project. People with a similar mindset who work towards a common goal tend to get along, and it has not been uncommon for friendships to form that last even after changing employer. By organizing opportunities to get to know the people you work with, we have been able to lay the groundwork for an easy-going atmosphere where interaction and cooperation flow smoothly regardless of titles or roles.Although the pandemic has limited engagement, the project team is now looking forward to a new normal in which virtual day-to-day work is combined with casual get-togethers and celebrations. Biannual theme parties for TietoEVRY and DNA project members have earned a legendary reputation across both companies over the years.The small things matter, like cupcakes! Image: DNAConclusionsA good cultural fit and acknowledging personal and team-level achievements boosts people’s pride and satisfaction in their work. This increases the overall interest in the customer’s solution and generates tangible business outcomes. The opportunity to grow within your role and learn from your colleagues is essential for long-term project assignments, as are minimal bureaucracy and good collaboration tools and processes, whether virtual or physical.Happy people make happy teams, and with happy teams communication, collaboration, and innovation become easy and enjoyable!Five cornerstones for building a happy teamThe personalities and competencies of team members should fit together well
Team well-being is a priority, making good project management essential
Transparency, honesty, freedom, and responsibility together create a culture of trust
The opportunity to learn and grow keeps things interesting
The small things matter! Recognition for a job well done, coffee and cake, cat videos, team lunches, teambuilding events outside work, candy surprises, you name it!What makes TietoEVRY an exciting place to work?Our Customer Experience unit can help you deliver meaningful end-to-end experiences.", Milla Rosenholm ,Digitalization , 15.11.2021
How Workday helps us to drive agility and scale after the merger,/en/blog/2021/11/how-workday-helps-us-to-drive-agility-and-scale-after-the-merger/,Digitalization / Matthew Hanwell / 15.11.2021,"This impacted our ability to manage our global workforce, both new and old colleagues from different backgrounds, with different ways of working and different organizational cultures. It also inhibited the increased business agility and scale advantage that were essential to the newly formed company’s success.I would like to share how being a part of the Workday ecosystem both as a customer and a partner has helped us to become Tietoevry.Why Workday – single source of data and enhanced business agilityAbove all, we wanted four things. First, we were looking for a single common HR system that would enable us to operate efficiently as one company. Second, we needed common global processes, streamlined and smooth decision-making, workflows and approvals. Third came an effective, Nordic graduate recruitment process. And, of course, we wanted data and insights to be readily available to managers and decision-makers. We have achieved all these goals and more.Workday had been implemented across the Tieto business in 2017, and as a result, we believed we could build on this foundation to deliver the single source of people information and the rapid implementation required. The team was also confident it could deliver the training to the former EVRY employees in the tight timescales required.The initial Workday implementation for Tieto was delivered by our own Workday consultants, the same approach was taken for the merger project. The new Tietoevry HR team partnered with Tietoevry´s Workday consultants and formed a combined team to overcome the challenges and finally achieve together the successful implementation for the whole new company.Implementation delivered in just five months despite COVID-19Communication during the implementation was complicated by the fact that a part of the workforce was familiar with Workday, while the other part had never seen it. It was as if we were “speaking a different language” and it was important to get the balance right and ensure common understanding for both groups. In addition, the two companies had different histories in their approach to systems. To add to the challenges, the pandemic meant the project had to run fully remotely, requiring a different approach with greater personal attention from those involved. Luckily, Workday´s implementation methodology can be followed fully remotely and having the guidance from experienced Tietoevry Workday consultants gave us the confidence to drive the project at full speed.Designing the project to fit our needsWorkday´s implementation methodology provided a solid backbone to our project and allowed us to both incorporate EVRY into Workday, and to optimize the processes for the new company. For example, we used the work streams familiar from the standard implementation but adjusted them to support the merger of two companies. To each stream (functional and technical implementation areas) we assigned one stream lead from exTieto and one stream lead from exEVRY. This set up allowed us to make decisions together while having a smooth Workday learning experience for exEVRY HR colleagues.Special attention was paid to getting the team working together. Project manager Jasmiina Galenius facilitated conversations and organised meetings for common discussions to bring the right people together. This approach helped the co-operation within the team and to make sure everyone was on the same page. To ensure high user adoption, we focused on change management and communication towards the new and the existing Workday users which was successfully accomplished via a program organized by Juuli Rajalahti.To achieve the very strict timeline, the project team on both the consultancy and HR side had to keep focus and only include items in the scope that were business-critical. All the “nice to have” items had to be strictly kept out of scope and marked as development items to be addressed after go-live.Despite the challenges and scale, the project was delivered within budget, and the tight five-month implementation schedule was achieved, followed by a period of stabilization to ensure the synergy benefits from optimized technology could be tracked, understood and maximized.Gaining the support of key stakeholder groupsOverall, Workday has helped the newly merged Tietoevry join forces. Managers have gained effective and streamlined access to their new teams, enabling efficient service and transactions. Other stakeholders such as Finance now receive data from a common source. Common governance and controls have been implemented, for example, approvals and workflows such as job requisition approvals. And having a common system means we are better able to quickly react to the changing environment when needed.These are some of the key benefits we gained:Highly capable and unified global workforce
Improved support for remote working
Better business insight across the organization
Enhanced ability to share data and experience
New company-wide people processes and best-practice Performance ManagementBringing Tietoevry to life as a single organizationWorkday going live across the merged organization was a fundamental step in bringing Tietoevry together as a fully integrated entity. Until that point, the company existed only in principle but with the Workday go-live, it became more operational and concrete.The go-live represented the first time that people could see in the system where they belonged within the organization, who their team members were and who they were reporting to. Managers likewise could see information about their people, regardless of where the employee originated. Overall, as a result, Tietoevry has a single consolidated view of our employees, our organization, our core people processes, and workflows, these are pivotal in becoming a unified company.Solution for the futureAs Tietoevry is now looking into implementing the new strategy, our HR team will collaborate with several stakeholders across the company to design the reorganization. With the merger, we have a recent experience redesigning our organizational chart in Workday. However, as an agile company, we are looking to improve our tools all the time. Therefore, we are excited to see how Workday´s latest features will support our next reorganization with the new strategy.", Matthew Hanwell ,Digitalization , 15.11.2021
"Why sovereign cloud is a hot topic – 5 tips, and the background",/en/blog/2021/11/why-sovereign-cloud-is-a-hot-topic/,Cloud / Wenche Karlstad / 9.11.2021,"Behind the move to make clouds sovereign is the need for digital sovereignty. In practice, this is all about data: where does it reside, where is it flowing, and who has control over it? These questions are critical for a modern data economy, where data means power. Inevitably, cloud services come under the spotlight. They are the engines of the data economy.Solving the legal limbo around cloud servicesEuropean industries and public sector organisations are storing more and more data in cloud data centres. As everyone knows, this playground is dominated by American tech giants. Now, regulation has caused a legal limbo around cloud. Among the driving factors are the US Cloud Act and similar laws in other countries such as China. They are in conflict with new EU rules and decisions by the EU Court of Justice, in particular a ground-breaking case coined Schrems II.The European Union wishes to mitigate dependence and the risk of foreign access to critical data, also considering that cloud is the powerhouse of AI, and other essential technology. EU regulations, such as GDPR, Data Act and Data Governance Act, are meant to control the flow of data across borders to prevent the risk of access to data by non-European authorities. In particular, the rules demand that sensitive or critical data stay on sovereign soil. This is emphasised in the Schrems II judgment. As a result, Chief Data Privacy Officers now need to understand and assess what data is stored in the cloud and whether any of that data is being transferred outside of the EU.Also read our previous blog: What you should know about CLOUD Act, Schrems II, Gaia-X and data sovereignty regulationsThe amount of metadata that cloud providers are collecting is much greater than people realise. The collection is often automatic and may include data such as IP addresses, credentials, as well as logging and diagnostic reports. The recommendation is to do a thorough data classification and application assessment to secure compliance. Organisations must deploy the right applications and the right data into the right cloud, whether it is private, hybrid or native public cloud.It is necessary to differentiate what data can be classified as critical according to national and regional security standards. First, there are different classification tiers such as public, confidential or restricted data, which vary by country or region. Second, there are different types of industry data such as national, corporate, or personal. That is why the first thing to do is a full data and application assessment.Sovereign cloud to ensure data sovereigntyToday, sovereign cloud lacks a definition that is commonly accepted or used in the industry. But fundamentally it is about data, its ownership, trust, control, national interests, and compliance with regulations. Why?A sovereign cloud ensures all data including metadata stays on sovereign soil and prevents foreign access to data under all circumstances. It provides a trusted environment for storing and processing data that can never be transferred across borders and must remain under one jurisdiction. Sovereign cloud is really about protecting and unlocking the value of critical data. Sovereign clouds are mature and well-established solutions that are part of emerging multi-cloud landscape. They also provide all the other core benefits of cloud such as agility, security and automation.In the end, sovereign cloud should be a part of a multi-cloud strategy. It just demands understanding that not all data is the same and that there are differences between clouds. The clouds have a different value proposition, and organisations must use each flavour side by side. It’s time to update your cloud strategy to match the current regulatory maze and take sovereign cloud as part of the palette.5 recommendations for sovereign cloudClassify your data, and for critical and sensitive data, mitigate all risks including data sovereignty and foreign access risks.
Create a Chief Data Privacy Officer or Data Guardian role in your organisation.
Understand your data flows and conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) before moving to the cloud.
Shift from Cloud First to Cloud Smart, deploying the right data/workload into the right cloud.
Engage a partner as a trusted multi-cloud advisor to guide you.Above all, digital sovereignty is the right of the nations, organisations and citizens to have control over their digital autonomy and their data. The sovereign cloud infrastructure is the connected ‘highways’ needed to unlock all the potential of the data-driven economies and promote the innovation of the society through digital technologies. Digital ecosystems need to flourish through collaboration and open access to commonly architected data hubs. The values of openness, trust and transparency, as well as the inclusiveness that we are proud of in the Nordic countries deserve to be guaranteed through digital empowerment.We are here to guide you through the maze, so don’t hesitate to contact us to continue the discussion.Download a whitepaper about digital sovereignty to learn more!Learn more about our services here to ensure that your data is protected and kept sovereign with a trusted, cloud infrastructure and data platform provider.", Wenche Karlstad ,Cloud , 9.11.2021
Time to navigate the data regulation and European sovereign cloud,/en/blog/2021/11/navigate-the-data-regulation-and-european-sovereign-cloud/,Cloud / Alberto Valero / 5.11.2021,"I had the honour of being the presenter in our livecast that covered the regulatory situation broadly. We had guests directly from the European Commission and the Gaia-X project, heard fresh experiences from Nordic organisations, and tips on how to start with sovereign cloud.Regulatory status update from the European CommissionThe keynote was presented by Salla Saastamoinen, the Acting Director-General of the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers. She gave a high-level overview of data protection policies and the regulatory framework that are aiming at establishing European data sovereignty.“How and by whom data is managed can have a serious impact on our competitiveness and way of life,” she said, explaining the reasoning behind the regulation that affects cloud services.Looming in the background are open questions concerning transatlantic data transfers. They have been complicated by the US Cloud Act and the Schrems II judgment by the European Court of Justice. Salla Saastamoinen said that intense discussions are ongoing with the US administration to find a stable solution.The EU has a clear goal: ensuring that European businesses and public sector organisations remain in control of their data and have their data in the cloud processed according to European rules and values.Salla Saastamoinen also touched upon interoperability as the most interesting part in the forthcoming European data governance act for buyers of cloud services. Interoperability allows freedom from vendor lock-in, and smooth data transfer from one cloud to another.Watch the 10-minute keynote!Gaia-X as a key component to digital sovereigntyTo facilitate interoperability and European sovereign cloud, an organisation called Gaia-X has been established. Its CEO Francesco Bonfiglio described how cloud is vital for a data economy, but how cloud is nothing without data to feed it.“Cloud is a primary ingredient like salt. You need it everywhere, but you can’t cook a dish just with salt,” he said.Bonfiglio pointed out that Europe is a minimal player in the cloud, and is feeding other data economies with high-quality data. To remain competitive, the data flow must be reversed. Therefore, Gaia-X has been created to reduce dependencies on non-sovereign, non-European technologies. It aims to create a new ecosystem for innovation for Europe and to incentivise the creation of new digital services through data sovereignty.Gaia-X delivers three things: 1) technical specifications and policy rules, 2) key components to enable transparency, interoperability and control, and 3) labels that certify the Gaia-X compliance of services.Watch Francesco Bonfiglio's 20-minute presentation!How to comply with the regulations - Nordic experiencesIn the panel discussion, we had representatives from Nordic private and public sector organisations sharing first-hand experiences. While everyone seems to be struggling to some extent, there are differences between the Nordic countries.For instance, the public sector in Sweden is in ‘wait’ mode. Jörgen Sandström, CIO of the Swedish city of Västerås, said that municipalities possess plenty of sensitive citizen data. He admitted living in great uncertainty concerning regulation, making any long-term decisions difficult. Therefore, the city is discussing with cloud suppliers to make intermediate solutions until there is more clarity.Petteri Miinalainen, CIO of Finnish insurance company Fennia, said that the Schrems II ruling forced the company to pause its large cloud transformation process on the fly to ensure compliance with the legal framework. Fennia has taken strict measures in building the new environment and is looking for solutions to ensure data is duly protected.Maria Rautavirta, Director of the Data Business Unit at the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications that also has an influence on national and EU level policies, encouraged organisations to start using cloud, sharing data and building data capabilities.Data Protection Officer Nancy Yue Liu from the Norwegian Diakonhjemmet said that, when doing global research, they struggle with GDPR compliance when transferring data with non-EU research institutes. To mitigate risks, data anonymisation is used as much as possible, and a risk assessment checklist has been created to help product owners and researchers.Watch the panel below!Practical guidance with sovereign cloudNext, Patrick Verhoeven, Director, Multi-cloud strategy at VMware, discussed drivers behind sovereign cloud. VMware’s sovereign cloud framework provides not only data sovereignty and jurisdictional control, but also ensures the integrity, security, compliance, and interoperability of data.“The very essence of the way that VMware defines sovereign cloud is that it’s about protecting and unlocking the value of critical data,” Verhoeven said, and presented VMware’s sovereign cloud initiative to designate cloud service providers.Finally, Yulia Filipovich, lead compliance manager at TietoEVRY, shared an example of how a Nordic bank can embark on its journey to cloud. With expert advice, it classified all data and applications and made a cloud assessment to deploy data to the right cloud. She noted that non-EU clouds should not be considered taboo, but their use requires meticulous planning to mitigate compliance risks.Watch ""The practical guide to sovereign cloud today"" presentation!To conclude, the livecast confirmed that data sovereignty is about foundational values such as democracy and freedom. It is also practical and has business value. There’s no need to wait.

GoField – The three most important steps towards SAP S/4HANA,/en/blog/2021/06/gofield--the-three-most-important-steps-towards-sap-s4hana/,Digitalization / Kari Pietiläinen / 4.11.2021,"Tietoevry boosts your S/4HANA journey and by applying the GoField method, ensures the following:An ERP architecture for the future, and functionality of the S/4HANA system
A roadmap to S/4HANA comprising projects of a sensible size
So we can get going, and in the right direction.The objective is a future-proof ERP architecture. First, you define which functions will be included in S/4HANA, and which will be obtained through other systems.The S/4HANA roadmap includes a phased transfer, comprising several smaller projects, from the existing SAP ERP to the desired S/4HANA system. At the same time, you build systems outside S/4HANA. These projects need to be started in time. Together with SAP S/4HANA, external systems often bring clear business benefits, and it makes sense to seek them out as soon as possible.Perhaps the most important step in the GoField method is getting started. The first step, where you roughly define the 1) current situation, 2) the desired ERP architecture, and 3) create the roadmap in four calendar weeks. The fixed duration ensures that the first step will actually be taken, and the project will get launched.ERP architecture for the futureThe desired ERP architecture must support future business needs. When making decisions on ERP architecture, it is important to understand:which capabilities you want to have within S/4HANA
and which capabilities will be implemented through systems outside S/4HANAIt is often necessary to make changes in both directions in comparison to the current situation. SAP has added functionalities from traditional satellite systems (such as APO, SRM, CRM) to S/4HANA. And, on the other hand, there are cloud-based solutions from SAP and other system providers available for an increasing number of business capabilities. The most important border area business capabilities are:Border area business capabilities are essential from the point of view of integrations. Different satellite systems (often cloud-based), and S/4HANA as the core, have specific domains. And a rough integration architecture is designed between them.A capability honeycomb roughly describes the functionalities to be included in S/4HANA (dark blue), the functions that clearly belong outside S/4HANA (white), and functions that need to be analysed on a client-specific basis and are subject to an architecture decision (light blue).S/4HANA roadmapThe way in which you switch to S/4HANA is one of the most important decisions in the roadmap. The main options are Greenfield, Bluefield and Brownfield. Usually, Bluefield is the most suitable way to migrate.One of the core objectives of the road map is to find a balance between the rapid and agile development required by business, and the fairly extensive IT system upgrade required by migration to S/4HANA. The balancing is done using three swim lines.A new S/4HANA system will be implemented in the SNP Bluefield transition lane. More information about the SNP Bluefield method is available here.
New S/4HANA functionalities are configured and implemented in the S/4HANA Business Capabilities lane. This takes place simultaneously with the SNP Bluefield project and continues after the introduction of the S/4HANA system.
Projects based on some other system than S/4HANA will be carried out in the Outside S/4HANA lane.When the ERP architecture has been defined at the beginning and the roles of the various systems are understood, development can be done in a parallel manner.The first step – getting startedThe first and perhaps most important step in the GoField method is getting started. You roughly analyse the current situation, plan the desired objective and ERP architecture, and create the roadmap during a period of four weeks.The end result provides the starting point for decision-making and more detailed planning of the S/4HANA project.

Card versus Super-App: which one wins?,/en/blog/2021/11/card-versus-super-app-which-one-wins/,Digitalization / Tommy Sveum / 3.11.2021,"Furthermore, as growth in credit card usage slows, The Financial Times reports[1] the profitability of credit cards dropped between 20 and 30% last year alone, with banks having to invest more in incentives to encourage consumer usage.As we argue in our new white paper, however, it’s not all bad news for card providers. Research from PCM[2] predicts cards – in both physical and virtual forms – will continue to dominate payments for the next five years, with just over half of all non-cash transactions continuing via cards through 2026. At the same time, growth in card transaction volumes and value will continue as people switch from cash to electronic payments around the world, while our own research in the UK and Nordics[3] shows that, at present, consumers prefer paying with cards compared to digital wallets.Despite these positive signs, now is the time for credit card issuers to supercharge their card offerings to compete with digital wallets. Digital wallet providers enjoy the advantage that they can add new functions to their product almost instantaneously through over-the-air updates to apps. Furthermore, digital wallets usually have user-friendly management options available to consumers via apps.In “Reinventing credit cards for the digital economy”, we argue that card issuers urgently need to modernise their offering, including more flexible product design and more capable card management solutions to respond to the threat posed by digital wallets. Examples include accounts that offer a Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) option alongside a credit card, or a savings product alongside other insurance and lending options.Card management: the core challengeIf greater functionality and better customer interfaces are the answer, then today’s card management systems, and specifically their credit and lending engines, are part of the problem. Existing card management systems can be expensive to operate, requiring extensive in-house development upgrades and constant management to maintain compliance with standards set by card networks and other systems.While it’s possible to build a new credit ledger system in-house, this can be time-consuming and expensive, requiring the hire of experts in building scalable, flexible solutions that put the customer journey and experience at the heart of their design. All too often, in-house systems also struggle to interface with external systems given a lack of open API interfaces, with poor customer experience the result.At TietoEVRY, we believe developing a partnership with an outsourced provider of modern, future-proof credit ledger systems is the most cost-efficient and effective way for credit card issuers to meet the threat of digital wallets. Customers now expect the capacity to alter credit limits, access statements and change services immediately via online service portals delivered via an app. To meet this expectation, issuers need to upgrade their card management systems, delivering future-proof, flexible systems that can cope with rapid changes to product design and management both in the physical world and online.A new wave of Software as a Service (SaaS)-based credit ledgers is emerging. These systems enable banks to offer attractive, personalised and flexible credit propositions. Based on an API structure which allows banks to view and edit cards products and account information, these ledgers can be updated instantly and do not depend on batch processing. This means customers can see changes right away and new product features can be used immediately without waiting for updates or new cards to be issued. From a bank perspective, repayment terms and dates, fees, minimum payments and other parameters can be edited in real time, with changes applied instantly.To find out more about how modernising your credit ledger systems will power up your card offering for consumers, download our new white paper here.[1] See The Financial Times: https://www.ft.com/content/fe591579-2202-45f1-8c83-a7e7dd1200c4[2] The Digital and Card Payment Yearbooks: www.paymentyearbooks.com[3] https://www.tietoevry.com/en/newsroom/all-news-and-releases/press-releases/2021/03/time-for-biometric-security-on-contactless-cards-new-research-from-tietoevry-reveals-uk-consumers-contactless-concerns/", Tommy Sveum ,Digitalization , 3.11.2021
Making the Leap From Developer to Test Automation Specialist,/en/blog/2021/10/making-the-leap-from-developer-to-test-automation-specialist/,Meet our people / Eemi Närhi / 1.11.2021,"Test automation was an unknown subject to me at that time and it was not a big topic in the networks I was in. The only encounter I had with test automation was a demo at my university about Robot Framework which I felt was interesting.Eventually my days as a software developer came to an end and my journey started in Tietoevry, the biggest IT service provider in the Nordics. In 2018, I joined the company as a summer trainee focusing on test automation. At that time, I was studying business information technology at Laurea University of Applied Sciences, and I was quite close to graduating with a bachelor’s degree.Jump into the deep endSoon after I joined Tietoevry, I started working in the renewal of a nationwide pension payment system. It was a big project which was done in a global delivery model in which more than 70 people participated. It felt exciting to be placed straight into the action in a real project. My main focus was on developing test automation solutions in a team of talented test automation and DevOps experts. In the beginning I was a little worried whether I would be able to build good quality Robot Framework testing for a complex system with no professional experience under my belt. However, my concern was swept away because developing test automation with Robot Framework proved to be quite easy to learn.In late 2018, I switched to part-time working when I had several university courses to complete. The possibility to combine the early stages of my professional career and my university studies is an excellent example of the flexibility we can have in our careers at Tietoevry. I could also choose to work from home when I felt the need to do so even before the pandemic started and remote working became common. The flexibility helped me in finishing my bachelor’s thesis and eventually graduating in 2019.All in all, I built hundreds of automated test cases for the pension payment system. Most of them were made for testing the system’s microservices REST APIs, but I also created some for the system’s user interfaces as well. The practice our team had was to prioritize building test automation for the APIs, because those tests are easier and faster to create and more robust than brittle UI tests.I value the experience I have from being a developer because it put me in a better position to understand some technical things about the system, like how REST APIs behave. Speaking of technical things, it probably would have been much harder for me to understand how Git version control was used in the project to store test automation resources if I hadn’t used version control systems in my previous role.The pension payment renewal is still the largest project I have participated in. Practicing new tools and learning to use them is always important, but for me the significant professional growth and lessons come from the projects. I’m very grateful for getting to collaborate and grow with all the amazing people there. All the experiences, challenges, and successes from working on such a complex and critical system are priceless to me. It was truly a perfect opportunity to grow!Continuous improvement brings me continuous happinessMy goal for 2021 has been to start learning how test automation solutions can be built in continuous delivery tools. I got a great opportunity to start achieving that goal when I joined our low-code team in the spring of 2021. I started looking into how test automation solutions can be built on a commercial low-code platform called OutSystems. It is a visual platform that accelerates the development and delivery of applications with AI-assisted tools. Application development is done with a graphical user interface instead of traditional programming.Regarding testing, automated unit tests can be built conveniently with the same visual workflow. This is provided by BDD Framework, which is a testing framework for OutSystems applications that encourages test- and behavior-driven development. Once I had finished creating a few tests the workflow seemed clear to me.Since I was curious about what test automation frameworks could be used for automated UI testing of OutSystems applications and given that I had plenty of experience with Robot Framework, I went ahead and did some experimenting. I was able to build automated tests for an OutSystems web application with Robot Framework’s Browser Library. Once that was done, I integrated the Robot Framework testing to Azure DevOps. I had certified myself in Azure cloud platform which helped me along the way. What motivated me greatly was the fact that TietoEVRY supports and encourages people in learning new technologies and achieving certifications which is useful in real projects.As I’m focusing on test automation, to me one of the strengths of OutSystems is that they provide a nice way to integrate continuous delivery tools with the OutSystems platform. That integration is critical since Azure DevOps is the place where the test automation is running in the shape of a CD pipeline. This pipeline is used as a quality gate for deploying our applications safely to production. I could talk more about our OutSystems continuous delivery pipeline, but perhaps I will share more of that topic in another blog.Ella Viitasuo is scoring goals both on the ice rink and at Tietoevry as a Test Automation Specialist.

But no more. As digitalization is everywhere, so must cybersecurity be everywhere.

Headless SAP – A practical guide to the architecture,/en/blog/2021/10/headless-sap--a-practical-guide-to-the-architecture/,Digitalization / Kari Pietiläinen / 28.10.2021,"1. An introduction to headless SAPThe concept and benefits are described in our previous blog.2. Headless SAP architecture – an exampleWe applied headless architecture to a tricky customer challenge that demanded an intuitive user interface plus lightning-fast response times. The business-critical process was already running on SAP, and only minimal changes to the existing SAP solution were allowed.Below we explain our architecture on three levels:UI development and framework
Front-end application
SAP back end and connectivityOur favourite platform for headless SAP development is Microsoft Azure, but similar architecture and concepts are available from all the major cloud platforms.UI development and frameworkThe solution required a fast, reliable, and state-of-the-art front end. React was chosen as the front-end framework because of its excellent adaptability and proven reliability.Front-end applicationThe solution’s core logic is built on top of Azure Function, a serverless offering that enables pay-per-use pricing and scaling from a few to millions of requests per hour – perfect for our solution, which will experience heavy loads during peak hours and low utilization outside of business hours. CosmosDB is a database solution that supports our core logic implementation by storing and staging data required by the application.Azure AD is used for user authentication and authorization, allowing us to provide users with a familiar and secure login process and to isolate our front-end application from SAP back-end user management.SAP back end and connectivityThe magic of our headless SAP architecture lies in how we integrate a modern UI framework and front-end application with an existing SAP back end.We expose SAP ERP 6.0 business processes via a modern REST API on top of the Azure platform. All SAP development details, user management issues, and connectivity complexities are hidden behind this API. Reading and writing data to SAP is as easy as using any web API.With SAP Gateway we converted the SAP data model to a standardized OData format without any changes to core business processes. The old ERP system became a modern web server with surprisingly little effort.3. Developing headless SAPHeadless SAP architecture shows promise as a design principle. In addition, we have found several benefits during the development and operation phases compared to traditional SAP development:We were able to bring in developers without an SAP background.
We achieved agile delivery with best-of-breed development and deployment tools.
With little to no SAP custom development needed, it was possible to keep the core clean and stable.Headless architecture allowed us to pinpoint bottlenecks and solve issues easily. The solution was so well contained, we were able to test parts of the application individually and determine the source of problems. In coupled architecture, this would not have been possible.4. Smooth transition to S/4HANAOur example was developed against SAP ERP 6.0. The transition to S/4HANA will be smooth both from a user and a technical perspective. Users can continue to use their front-end application normally after the S/4HANA transition, and only a few ABAPers need to migrate APIs from ERP to S/4HANA. S/4HANA might require minor changes to ABAP code due to the simplified data model in the HANA database.Are you ready to delight your SAP users with a superior user experience and make your organizational journey to S/4HANA a smooth one? Here’s how:Make the decision to switch to headless SAP architecture.

Data lakes and warehouses part 3: Azure Synapse point of view,/en/blog/2021/10/data-lakes-and-warehouses-azure-synapse-point-of-view/,Data / Timo Aho / 25.10.2021,"To familiarize yourself with the topic, I suggest you read the previous articles in this series first.Data lakes and warehouses part 1: Intro to paradigmsData lakes and warehouses part 2: Databricks and SnowflakeData lakes and warehouses part 3: Azure Synapse point of viewData lakes and warehouses part 4: ChallengesWe now consider a more novel solution that has a slightly different angle to the topic. Namely we will discuss Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics environment. As a matter of fact, the motivation for this post was the number of questions in the line of “Should we take Snowflake, Databricks or Synapse?” After this post, I hope you understand why the question is difficult to answer.Azure Synapse collects multiple products under the same umbrellaIn the previous posts we noted that a data analytics platform can be divided into stages. In the picture above, green illustrates a processing and blue a storage tool. We can see how Azure Synapse environment covers both processing and storage. For the other mentioned products, please check the previous posts.To be exact, Synapse is not a single product but a framework which offers a set of tools as components. This way, we have multiple cloud data products under a single brand and interface covering all the cloud big data analytics platform stages. Moreover, Synapse environment offers tools for both data warehouse building and data lake development.Now, the first question is whether we gain anything in branding multiple tools again. Why do we not use the tools separately? Personally, I am starting to think Synapse umbrella product makes sense. We will come back to the question later. Let us first start with an overview of the Azure Synapse environmentAzure Synapse componentsLet us briefly go through Azure Synapse Analytics environment as I understand it. Azure Synapse Analytics platform could be described to have following components:Graphic ELT/ETL tool, named Pipelines, for data ingesting and processing. In practice, the component is the same as the older Azure Data Factory service.
Dedicated SQL pool data warehouse for data structuring. Related to this, Microsoft made a blunder in launching Synapse. Initially, this component was introduced to cover all the Synapse environment. I still run into the misunderstanding of Synapse being just a new name for the data warehouse.
Programming language based Apache Spark pool and Serverless SQL pool for data querying and processing in the cloud. These components are novel and available only in the Synapse environment.In addition to these, the environment offers following functionalities between the components:A centralized graphical workspace user interface which gives access to all the tools
Light visualization capabilities and integration with Power BI reporting
A common data lake table schema repository usable in all the tools
A natural connection to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 cloud storage service and Azure AD permission managementAs far as I know, similar overall framework is unique and not yet offered by any other cloud provider.So, what is new for analytics?Some of the tools, especially Data Factory and the data warehouse, were already available before Synapse environment. Thus, they do not really bring new value. It might very well make sense to use the components separately without the full framework.However, for instance Serverless SQL pool is a great new functionality in Azure big data offering. It is an SQL querying tool available as a service: You do not need to build any infrastructure. It is available right away and you pay by the usage. The best comparison point to this would be AWS cloud environment Athena service. Moreover, Apache Spark pool is a tool which could shortly be described as a light version of Databricks.Conclusions – Tool packaging helpsAll in all, do we gain something with Synapse framework? I must admit I was initially really sceptic about this. However, after getting some experience, my personal answer would be affirmative, to some extent at least. First, there is real integration between the components. For instance, it is possible to define common relational database type tables which are accessible from multiple tools.On the other hand, having a single workspace as a graphical user interface is beneficial. Typically, you need to have quite a wide understanding on cloud big data components when building a new analytics platform. With Synapse, they are easily available as a package. This both helps new developers to start working but also might help in handling the security of the overall solution. Thus, I would say Synapse framework has been quite a successful investment for Microsoft, at least from a technology perspective.An interesting detail arises when we go back to the data warehouse and data lake paradigm distinction presented in the first post of the series. From an expenses point of view, the two paradigms can be seen in the Synapse environment components. Except for Synapse Dedicated SQL pool data warehouse, all the processing components are paid by the usage as is typical to the data lake paradigm. All the tools even have an automatic shutdown. Thus, if you try the Synapse environment, remember to shut down the data warehouse to stop it from gathering expenses. The other components take care of themselves.Azure Synapse environment is quite unique in the sense that all the relevant big data lake and data warehouse tools are gathered in the same package. Even if you can use some of them separately, combining them has its advantages.", Timo Aho ,Data , 25.10.2021
"Time to get updated on CLOUD Act, Schrems II, Gaia-X and data sovereignty regulations",/en/blog/2021/10/time-to-get-updated-on-cloud-act-schrems-ii-gaia-x-and-data-sovereignty-regulations/,Cloud / Yulia Filipovich / 22.10.2021,"What significant steps need to be taken to defend digital sovereignty in regard to overseas laws? In order to clarify the situation and in an attempt to dispel some doubts and skepticism concerning the CLOUD Act, let’s recap what has happened since its introduction.You might also be interested in our livecast recording: Navigate the data sovereignty maze – from cloud first to cloud smartHow the CLOUD Act impacts all organizations, not just cloud providersThe CLOUD Act shouldn't be associated with cloud providers only; it applies to all companies doing business in the US. The act has two distinct parts. The first clarifies the existing legal situation and process to be used by US law enforcement agencies, referring to concerns that the MLAT (mutual legal assistance treaty) is too slow and creates massive challenges for crime-fighting authorities. The second part authorizes the US to enter into executive agreements with foreign states. On October 3, 2019, the US and the UK entered into the world’s first-ever CLOUD Act Agreement – the US-UK Bilateral Data Access Agreement. This agreement allows law enforcement agencies of both countries to demand, with proper authorization, electronic data regarding serious crime directly from tech companies based in the other country.No EU member states have signed such an agreement with the US. MLAT is still the norm for cross-border data discovery as the optimal mechanism for law enforcement requests for data involving EU data controllers or processors.Schrems II and personal data transfer to third-party countriesOn July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) released the Schrems II judgment, which had significant implications for users of US cloud services. The CJEU annulled Decision 2016/1250 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-US Privacy Shield, and reiterated the fact that it considered Commission Decision 2010/87 on standard contractual clauses (SCCs) for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries to be valid. The clauses contain obligations for both data exporters and data importers who transfer personal data to counties outside the EU and receive such data from the countries outside the EU.In practice this meansThe EU-US Privacy Shield, a self-certification framework which allowed data transfers to the US, can no longer be used to transfer personal data to US.
SCCs are still valid but require a case-by-case assessment on whether EU-level data protection is ensured; if not, supplemental technical and contractual measures must be put in place.
All existing SCCs must be updated with the new EU templates by December 27, 2022.Customers of US cloud service providers must now verify the recipient country's data protection laws, document its risk assessment, and confer with its customers. The full list of non-EU countries that the EU considers to have an adequate level of data protection is available on the European Commission website.On May 19, 2021, the European Data Protection Board established by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) adopted the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe Data Protection Code of Conduct (CISPE Code), the first pan-European data protection code of conduct for cloud infrastructure service providers under Article 40 of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. One of the key advantages offered by the CISPE Code that goes beyond GDPR is retaining sovereignty over data by giving an option to select services that store and process customer data, ensuring it remains within the EU. It helps EU organizations to ensure that their cloud service providers are in compliance with GDPR and to avoid the uncertainty caused by the Schrems II ruling.Hear European Commission's update in our livecast recordingReaching consensus over the use of encryptionThe CLOUD Act is so-called “encryption neutral”. It does not give US law enforcement agencies any new powers to compel a service provider to break the encryption of communications. Also, the CLOUD Act neither prevents a service provider from assisting the customer in encrypting their information nor places restrictions on foreign countries having their own rules regarding decryption in domestic law.On October 11, 2020 the US released an international statement: End-To-End Encryption and Public Safety. This statement calls on technology companies to collaborate with governments on mutually agreeable solutions, pointing out that today's end-to-end encryption solutions preclude all access to content, even when investigating the most serious crimes. This initiative has already been signed by the governments of the UK, Australia, Canada, India, Japan, New Zealand, and the US.In November 2020, the European Council adopted a resolution on encryption: Security through encryption and security despite encryption. It calls upon EU member states to join forces with the tech industry to find the right balance between security despite and through encryption, develop a regulatory framework, and innovate investigative capabilities around encryption.Gaia-X is not just a cloud but a networked systemTo add to the list of regulations you should be aware of, there is also Gaia-X. Gaia-X is a European initiative to promote and develop the digital economy by establishing the next generation of data infrastructure: an open, transparent, and secure digital ecosystem where data and services can be made available, collated, and shared in an environment of trust. One of the aims of this initiative is to mitigate dependency on overseas providers by bringing together people from different companies, research institutions, associations, administrations, and political parties to form a European cloud provider ecosystem and to build solutions that can be protected by European data laws. CISPE is one of the founding members of Gaia-X.Hear from the latest updates from the CEO of Gaia-X in our livecast recording.How to navigate the regulatory mazeWe will continue to combat requests that are contrary to digital sovereignty in terms of overseas laws. While we are witnessing what is happening on the legal battlefield and wondering whether our information may be the subject of a criminal investigation, we must ask ourselves if our security practices are strong enough to confront the real cybersecurity threat.In real life, attackers don't care where a workload is located, and in fact, an attack might move from the on-premises local network up to the cloud and vice versa. Security experts need visibility that spans all environments to understand the broader picture of what malicious actors might be doing. The high road for handling security issues is having insight in the form of a centralized dashboard that combines both preventive and reactive measures to ensure a holistic approach.To future-proof your business, your organization needs data classification and a multi-cloud strategy that can secure safe data flow across different environments and ensure business continuity. This strategy must comply with global, local, regional, and industry-level regulatory requirements.In our next blog, we will discuss more about how organizations can manage the regulatory maze and give some practical examples.Read next: Why sovereign cloud is a hot topicWatch a livecast recording: Navigate the data sovereignty maze – from cloud first to cloud smart", Yulia Filipovich ,Cloud , 22.10.2021

SIAM - The Fifth Pillar,/en/blog/2021/10/SIAM-The-Fifth-Pillar/,Cloud / Satyendra Seth / 20.10.2021,"If we look at the ITIL service lifecycle pictorial representation, we find Service Strategy at the crux and all other lifecycle phases revolve around it.This in other terms also mean that if the Service Stratification phase is robust, then all the other phases will start aligning themselves around the same and will be able to deliver effective SD. This is yet another key aspect of discussion, however I say maybe for some other day.Now if we look at the 4 Ps of Service Management, which are also known as the 4 Pillars of SM, they provide foundation for effective Service Delivery using ITIL as the best practice. SM is something we have now been doing for decades, so the pivotal question is what SIAM brings in for us in terms of improved SD.What is the Fifth Pillar in SIAM?I have been asked this in multiple workshops, trainings, webinars and likewise as to how can I describe SIAM in 1 word. Well, the first time I was asked, I am sure I could not do it, however later when I turned back the pages of my professional life and started relating it to what am I doing in SIAM, I was able to figure out that 1 word to describe SIAM. Governance, is that key word that differentiates SIAM from traditional SM. Ironically we have been interchangeably using Delivery and Governance at our will / convenience, which is actually not the case. Delivery focuses on delivering the services and Governance deals in governing the delivered service.Governance is a structured methodology to achieve Value Creation. In principle through SIAM we need to ensure governance in and around:E2E (End to End) Service Governance.
Contract Governance across provider(s).
Ecosystem level Governance across provider(s).
Governance around Tools and Process standardization across provider(s).SIAM weaves up the multi-vendor environment into a single ecosystem, where the philosophy is “We succeed together and / or we fail together”, and the objective is to eliminate “Blame Game” and “Coexist in Harmony”. And just in case if you are wondering, these are not some good-looking English statements, we have many examples to exhibit this on records. And this is exactly “The Fifth Pillar” which I think is introduced by SIAM to ensure efficient and effective SD, elevating the traditional SM to the next level. And this is how I perceive SIAM and “The Fifth Pillar”.All very well said, however yet not done. What does SIAM need for apt Governance?SIAM Enablement / Empowerment: SIAM should be empowered to act on Client’s behalf in every aspect of SD. SIAM should have that power and control to act, recommend and improvise independently to the very possible extent and later in conjunction with Client to be able to Govern the SD lifecycle End to End.
SIAM Acceptance / Collaboration: Client organization is a huge pool of stakeholders and to bring in Governance through SIAM, it requires a conscious effort at Client end to embrace SIAM within their ecosystem. This acceptance is the key attribute for SIAM’s success in enforcing Governance framework across Partner(s) and Client. Once SIAM is accepted, collaboration starts percolating and irons out the SD as would have been expected from SIAM.
Technology Strategy: SIAM needs to be enabled with Technology Strategy and have a deeper understanding of Client’s outlook towards Business Technology and the landscape as it would be in near and far future.
Tools Strategy: SIAM will need understanding of Client’s Tools Strategy to ensure the partners adhere to the same and work as one team and not in silos.
Process Strategy: Well defined Process Strategy from the Client will empower and enable SIAM to ensure the same is percolated well within the Partner ecosystem.
Partner Strategy: A well-defined Partner Strategy will enable SIAM to be more vigilant and aligned towards apt Partner selection and ensuring Client’s Process, Tools and Business Strategy are well embraced / adopted within the Partner ecosystem.Looks easy, however is it that easy to adopt and adapt SIAM? I’ll be continuing these aspects in the coming blogs to understand and discuss about the minute details in detail.Happy reading and keep abreast.P.S. These are my opinion based on years of experience and engagement in the SIAM space. Further views are solicited and appreciated.Want to get more insights on the next generation SIAM services that matches the new demands and different drivers for Service Management transformation?

The passion for IFS made Damith Jinasena take a leap from Sri Lanka to Sweden,/en/blog/2021/10/the-passion-for-ifs-led-damith-jinasena-to-a-new-career/,/ Damith Jinasena / 18.10.2021,"I was born and raised in Sri Lanka, where I started my career as a support consultant at IFS Applications. Today, I have over 12 years of experience in the IFS technical domain, integrations, and cloud technologies. As a developer and consultant, I got the opportunity to travel the world, and of all countries I have visited, Sweden always felt like a second home with all the nice people I met and the closeness to nature. I was also inspired by the new ways of thinking, the creativity and innovations. I joined Tietoevry in 2019, and it was of course challenging to move to Sweden all the way from Sri Lanka together with my family. But I did it without hesitation because I felt that Tietoevry fit my career expectations and it was the right place for me to be.Keep learning new things – and sharing my expertise with othersToday, I work as a technical consultant in the IFS Application Services team. My daily work includes designing and developing solutions for customers related to IFS ERP, building integrations for connecting other systems with IFS and guiding customers and colleagues around the technical aspects of IFS. Besides that, I have a huge interest in cloud technologies, so I am also a part of the IFS cloud deployments where we setup IFS in different cloud platforms. My passion for IFS and technical stuff even extends beyond regular office hours. In my spare time I help the IFS online community by answering questions, blogging or coding for fun, like Raspberry pi or Arduino. Besides my passion for IFS I also enjoy cycling and reading books, especially autobiographies.What made TietoEVRY a perfect match for me is that we provide the complete IFS solution package from application operation, support and consulting. This means that there is always an interesting problem to solve somewhere in our IFS team, and as someone who likes to move beyond traditional thinking, I adore meeting new challenges in different areas. Helping others and learning new things really motivates me, and one of my favorite things about Tietoevry is that we have so many learning and career opportunities. But most importantly of course, is that I have a great team of colleagues which makes work so much fun.The keys to success in my workFrom my experience working as a developer and consultant, I think that the most important skills to be successful in this work are:Communication - To get a better understanding about customer problems, we need to build good communication skills. Different customers express their needs in different ways, and by listening and asking questions, we can get a better idea of the situation and take appropriate actions.
Self-confidence - We work with high profile customers, and ERP plays a major role in their business. Usually, they seek our help when they cannot solve a problem by themselves. It is always challenging to work in those situations, but when you trust yourself and your skills, you can accept any challenge with a smile.
Teamwork - Teams are always the key to success. Helping each other and asking for help is equally important when working as a team. When you have a good team, working is a lot of fun and can deliver high quality solutions to customers at the same time.
Learning - There is something new to learn every day at work. We must keep ourselves updated with the product and technology changes to stay sharp in our industry.Joining Tietoevry was a critical decision in my life.

AI: the gateway to successful churn prevention and customer retention,/en/blog/2021/10/ai-the-gateway-to-successful-churn-prevention-and-customer-retention/,Data / Aleksandr Peussa  / 14.10.2021,"As a result, many companies experience an increased risk of churn, which leads to squeezed profit margins. According to Insvesp Consulting, it can cost five times more to attract a new customer than it does to retain an existing one. Moreover, according to the book Marketing Metrics, businesses have a 60 to 70% chance of selling to an existing customer while the probability of selling to a new prospect is only 5% to 20%.The risk of credit risk mitigationHistorically, banks have always concentrated on credit risk mitigation, which leads to a situation in which churn event-related risks remain uncovered. However, based on current market conditions, churn could lead to even bigger losses than traditional credit losses.Not surprisingly, profit losses due to customer churn are a big risk within consumer finance. In the Nordics and Baltics, this is driven by a highly competitive consumer loan market which is dominated by brokers offering customers a simple but effective product. By completing a single loan application, consumers can receive dozens of offers from different banks – so they no longer need to apply for loans at individual banks. Essentially, broker companies act as an expensive sales channel for banks who now have to pay broker commission for customers, customers who would previously come to them directly. And, if a customer churns, the bank in question pays twice in the sense that they lose the expected profits from the customer and incur the additional commission cost of acquiring a new customer to replace the churned one. Therefore; preventing churn is imperative.Effective churn preventionThere are two important aspects of customers’ churn prevention:Identifying customers with high churn risk
Taking appropriate actions to ensure customer retentionIf a bank is unable to do these effectively, unnecessary operational costs are incurred. These include costly customer relation operations and lost revenues through offering better banking conditions to customers who have no intention of churning. This costly process can be minimized by using AI.A new approach to churnBy analyzing your customer’s past and current behavior, our AI solution can identify existing high churn risk customers, several months before they actually churn. It includes powerful insight and traceability tools that provide personalized recommendations to retain these customers. Recommendations include lowering loan interest rates, increasing loan amounts, and reducing monthly payment instalments.Additionally, our AI solution can help you identify the sweet spot between credit risk and churn risk, based on your risk appetite. This will depend on if your bank concentrates on:the low credit risk segment where credit losses are minimal but churn risk is high
the high credit risk segment where churn risk is low and credit losses are higher
somewhere in the middle.If you want to turn your historical data into a competitive advantage, intensify portfolio profitability or just hear more about our AI-based solutions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

"SAP security on the public cloud – the same, but different?",/en/blog/2021/10/sap-on-public-cloud-security--the-same-but-different/,Cloud / Pete Nieminen / 14.10.2021,"Being a late bloomer, on the plus side, as a late starter, we have avoided the early adopter pitfalls, and the public cloud is now much more mature in terms of large-scale SAP implementations.The public cloud has now become so good at providing business flexibility, scalability, and security around business-critical systems like SAP that can’t afford not to make the move to the public cloud. When I talk about the public cloud, I mean the hyperscalers like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform. Currently, the large-enterprise SAP market is dominated by Azure, but time will tell how the battle plays out between the public cloud giants.Security has been a hot topic in the ICT world since the late 90s. In modern cybersecurity, we have several standards, compliance models, and best practices. The world is full of security companies that are inventing better solutions to counter the ever-increasing threat of cybercrime.So how does this relate to SAP on the public cloud? Traditionally, SAP has been sitting in the inner premises of enterprise infrastructure, protected by the strong physical security of datacenters and somewhat layered outer protection. The only SAP-specific protection has been security updates, which have not been applied consistently due to the complexity and business criticality of the SAP ecosystem. The cyberworld has changed during the last ten years. Attacks are extremely complex, combining long-lasting hidden application threats, physical access exploitation, and government-funded penetration toolkits.Shared security responsibility – a new governance model for enterprisesHyperscalers will take care of physical security, hyperscale infrastructure, and the hyperscale software layer better than any normal enterprise could ever afford to do or be able to do alone. This alone is a good enough reason to move SAP to the public cloud. Some time ago the rest of the shared model was considered the customer’s responsibility, but that has also changed. Previously, enterprises utilizing the public cloud relied on the support of their skilled and certified integration service providers and specialized cybersecurity companies; now, the hyperscalers offer a wide variety of cloud-dedicated tools to manage the rest of the security landscape. As a good example, Azure offers tools like Sentinel, Security Center, Information Protection, Identity Protection, and Microsoft Defender to protect business-critical application ecosystems, along with customer endpoints.Despite the significant progress made by SAP on the public cloud during the last seven years, it is still in its infancy compared to SAP itself, which has been around since the 70s, and cybersecurity, which came to prominence in the 90s. The agile and constantly evolving cloud brings its own challenges to the equation.TietoEVRY has released a whitepaper to help enterprises familiarize themselves with the topic and to give some security guidance for those who are planning or have already begun their SAP on the public cloud transformation.", Pete Nieminen ,Cloud , 14.10.2021
Time to make your integration strategy a business strategy,/en/blog/2021/10/make-your-integration-strategy-a-business-strategy/,Data / Rakesh Singh / 12.10.2021,"But organizations are realizing that integration is no longer only a technical question for an organization, but rather a business requirement.This shift began even prior to the COVID-19 era, but it is now more apparent than ever that the pandemic has had a huge impact on our society; in the ways we conduct business as well as how we communicate and provide services. People are using many different sets of applications to take care of their daily business needs, and none of these applications work alone – they need to communicate with several other applications to perform the task. Therefore, organizations’ integration strategy has become a business topic and can no longer be delegated to the IT department.The business landscape is changingWe can clearly see how the business landscape is changing. Where historically the focus was on delivering high quality products, the focus has shifted towards a more results-oriented mindset where customers perceive value differently. Organizations have now started talking about added value of products or services, rather than purely considering the cost, and it is playing a major role in decision-making processes.It is interesting to see how the changes in the business landscape have impacted technology solutions. Over the last few years, we have seen a revolution, where organizations are looking for flexibility and adopting fast changing technology like AI and IoT. It is no longer the case that one enterprise application is taking care of all business needs. Every team or department has the freedom to choose their own tools and solutions, whatever best fits their business requirements. In order to meet the requirement of flexibility, it’s important that ERP solutions address the future challenges and provide an ecosystem to support innovation.Flexibility to meet the future challenges of ERPCOVID-19 and the shift towards online purchasing over traditional physical stores, has shown that current ERP systems are not agile or flexible enough to keep pace with the required speed of change driven by customer behavior. Even before the Covid-19 era monolithic ERP was a major hurdle in organizations' modernization strategy, due to heavy customization and application limitations. Thereby pushing organizations to revisit their ERP strategy.As per Gartner; By 2023, organizations that have adopted a composable approach to ERP will outpace the competition by 80% in the speed of new feature implementation.To ensure that all applications together with the core ERP system work seamlessly together and deliver the expected results, it is important to have an integration platform that makes this possible.Picking the right integration platformIn its simplest term, an Integration platform is software that supports a number of applications to integrate across on-premises resources and cloud. Some of the major benefits are optimizing business processes and reducing cost and bottlenecks.The first step any organization needs to take when selecting an integration platform and an API management platform, is to choose which available platform is best suited for their business requirements. There are of course several options available on the market with its own pros and cons. It is important to focus on features supported by the specific platform and its business usage.Some important points to keep in mind when selecting the integration platform:1. Integration anywhere with any applicationsIn this innovation era, the number of applications being used by organizations is increasing at a very fast pace. All these applications need to communicate with each other, and with the applications from customers and vendors. These applications have the possibility to run from any location and/or any server. It is important that the integration platform supports all these integrations.2. Fast developmentTo support business expansion, it is important that newly acquired systems work together with existing systems. To get maximum benefits it is important that this integration happens very fast. Therefore, investigate which integration platforms support low code with auto-deployment features.3. Hybrid solutionLots of new systems are available as a SaaS (Software as a Service) solution or running in the cloud. At the same time most of the legacy applications are still running on-premise. Organizations will achieve maximum benefits when data between the systems in the cloud and on-premise communicate with each other. Silos are no longer an option for organizations: an integration platform should support hybrid solutions.4. FlexibilityIt is important that the integration platform is flexible enough to take care of the ever-changing application landscape. This means that the platform should not only support both cloud and on-premises applications, but also have the capability to scale up and scale down when needed.5. API ManagementIt doesn’t matter if a solution is based on a microservice, is monolithic or if legacy applications are being used – data between systems need to communicate with each other. API management is the process of creating and publishing API, enforcing their usage policies, controlling access, nurturing the subscriber community, collecting and analyzing usage statistics, and reporting on performance. API Management is one of most crucial requirements for a successful digital journey of any organization.TietoEVRY is well established in the Nordics with global delivery capabilities and expertise in both ERP and integration solutions.

Changing Platforms: Reinventing credit cards for the digital era,/en/blog/2021/10/changing-platforms-reinventing-credit-cards-for-the-digital-era/,Digitalization / Tommy Sveum / 12.10.2021,"On the face of it, things don’t look great for credit card providers. The number of debit cards is growing twice as fast as credit[1], while WorldPay predict[2] that digital wallets linked directly to accounts and BNPL solutions will account for 48% of all non-cash transactions by 2026. If that’s not bad enough, The Financial Times recently reported[3] that the profitability of credit cards dropped by around 25% last year alone as banks invested more in incentives to encourage consumer usage.That said, as we show in our new white paper, it’s not all doom and gloom for credit card providers. Demand is still growing, fuelled in part by the continued move away from cash, and by newly-affluent consumers looking for the convenience and international capabilities that credit cards offer. Furthermore, the growth in virtual card issuance has revitalised the credit segment for online use.Despite these positive signs, there’s no doubt that credit card providers urgently need to modernise their offering, including more flexible product design, instant updates of card functionality and more capable card account management solutions. In brief, cards need to adopt some of those features – such as multiple functionality and over-the-air updates – which fans of digital wallets enjoy.Our white paper, “Reinventing credit cards for the digital economy”, argues that today’s card management systems, and specifically their credit and lending engines, do not make the introduction of flexible, dynamic, multi-function products easy. The card management platforms currently in use are expensive to operate and can require extensive in-house patching and upgrades to maintain compliance with standards set by card networks and regulators.Historically, credit card ledgers have been used to calculate fees, manage transaction flows, calculate interest and undertake other basic functions. Our view is that banks must power up these ledger systems and enable a new generation of card products featuring multi-function, flexible cards that can be issued and managed in both physical and virtual environments. Examples include adding or editing loyalty points functions to credit cards in real time, or – for corporate cards – offering the same wide-ranging functionalities offered to consumers. This is particularly important given reports in Europe[4] that corporate customers are unhappy with the narrow range of functions available on corporate cards.Banks could also use these newly-capable platforms to add other functions, including loan financing, insurance, BNPL, reward programs and campaign management as well as subscription payments alongside the main credit function.Our white paper makes the case that the most efficient means of achieving this system-wide upgrade for credit products is to switch to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based credit ledger solution. In this way, banks can reduce the costs associated with in-house software upgrades and compliance, while also improving the interoperability of their card systems with other account functions and delivering more dynamic and capable products to market.In moving to the next generation of credit ledgers, banks will effectively reinvent credit cards as a viable competitor to multi-function wallets. Such new credit ledger systems could be a game-changer, enabling banks to take advantage of their strong customer relationships to rethink how cards are used and managed for decades to come.To download a copy of our new white paper, “Reinventing credit cards for the digital economy”, click here.[1] The Digital and Card Payment Yearbooks: www.paymentyearbooks.com[2] WorldPay/FIS: “The Global Payments Report 2021”: https://worldpay.globalpaymentsreport.com/en/[3] See The Financial Times: https://www.ft.com/content/fe591579-2202-45f1-8c83-a7e7dd1200c4[4] See a recent Norwegian survey of corporate cardholders: ): http://www.epsi-norway.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bankbransjen-2021-et-sammendrag.pdf?x34714).", Tommy Sveum ,Digitalization , 12.10.2021
Is an open-source-based solution viable for edge computing deployments?,/en/blog/2021/10/is-an-open-source-based-solution-viable-for-edge-computing-deployments/,Cloud / Marcin Nicpon / 12.10.2021,"The telecommunication industry has used edge computing for years with proven benefits for end-users and service providers. We see more and more industries developing their edge computing strategies when seeking improved performance, cost-efficiency, and security.The evolution of the edge computing approachMany earlier edge computing deployments were based on dedicated function network appliances with integrated hardware and software, which easily led to vendor lock-in situations, limited scalability options, and lengthened time-to-market of new services.The evolution of cloudification and virtualisation technologies enabled increased predictability and performance, and more and more service providers started to use Commercial off-the-shelf hardware-based applications for edge solutions as well. Today, the majority of Independent Software Vendors already offer commercial systems based on those principles.At the same time, a strongly growing open-source culture, communities and independent contributors have started to foster industry innovation and create groundbreaking cloud and edge software solutions. Intel Smart Edge Open (OpenNESS), which is deployed in our platform, is also strongly supported by Intel’s roadmap. This ensures that all the latest performance and functional Intel technology features are available in the package and makes the platform future-proof as well.Addressing challenges of open-source-based edge solutionsOpen-source solutions also bring challenges related to readiness for commercial deployments and structured support. Service providers who opt for productising opensource solutions need to ensure that the right competencies and skills are already in-house – because building them from scratch requires investments and impacts both time-to-market and the total cost of ownership of the solutions.The challenges we saw our customers experiencing inspired us to join forces with Intel and Advantech.

Diversity drives equality in digital services,/en/blog/2021/10/diversity-drives-equality-in-digital-services/,Sustainability / Satu Kiiskinen  / 11.10.2021,"In this rapidly changing world, algorithms steer the lives and choices of people more and more often. It’s important that services meet the diverse needs of different user groups, and that algorithms and AI neither favour nor discriminate against anybody.At the same time, people must have equal rights in their access to digital services. But there is still a long way to go in achieving this.By working together, we can ensure that different viewpoints and needs are not forgotten when digital services are developed. In building our digital future, we must ensure that services take the different backgrounds of people into consideration.Citizens of all backgrounds use digital services, so the services need to be designed with diversity in mind. It’s important that we have versatile teams for developing services and algorithms, as designers influence technology with their personal backgrounds and attributes.Diversity creates new growth opportunities for businesses and societyDiversity brings different viewpoints and ways of thinking. By embracing this, a company can make better decisions in every part of its operations. The different ideas arising from diversity and unbiased innovation breed services, products, and ways of working that better meet user needs.Companies that promote diversity in their operations are also the most attractive employers. Diversity is a value that attracts new experts while building deeper engagement with the ones a company already has.All this directly influences the success of companies. Diversity is essentially a competitive factor that ultimately affects profitability and value creation.Lack of diversity can lead to distortions in servicesThere are several examples globally of how a lack of diversity has led to distortions in coding and the development of technology. Often these problems are the result of the share of women working in the industry being too small.Several digital services exploit AI and algorithms based on data. Any underlying omissions, mistakes or distortions may have a significant impact on the use of such services, especially when different types of users are objects of a decision made automatically by AI. For example, an AI-based recruitment tool at a popular online retailer automatically reinforced predominant bias and attitudes related to gender, and began to discriminate against women.Cultural stereotyping and gender bias have also been experienced in translation services. For instance, the AI of a widely used translation engine automatically assumed that a nurse is a woman, even when it was not possible to derive gender from a personal pronoun. Distortions can also be found in several speech-recognition services that understand the voice of a man better than that of a woman.We invest in diversity: from words to actionsThe strengthening of diversity and equality is central to TietoEVRY’s core values and goals. As part of our responsibility plan 2021–2023, we published an ambitious goal for the future: our aim is to increase the share of women among our personnel to 40% by 2026, and to 50% by 2030.In Finland, only around one fifth of technology-industry experts are women. They are part of a rising trend though – in the past five years the share of applicants to ICT studies has doubled. But there is a lot more to do before we can balance the distribution and attract more women to become experts in our field.", Satu Kiiskinen  ,Sustainability , 11.10.2021
Time to talk about cloud security (part I),/en/blog/2021/10/cloud-security-abc/,Cybersecurity insights / Toni Kuokkanen / 8.10.2021,"While the above statement is largely true, there are some misconceptions about how cloud infrastructure should be used and managed – and what the risks are.Don’t play fast and loose – unless you want to loseI have spoken with a lot of clients about the importance of knowing what you are doing, how you are doing it, and why you are doing it. In the cloud this is even more important as it is so easy to play fast and loose. And if you’re doing things in an uncontrolled way there is a big risk that you’ll unwittingly expose some attack vectors that hackers can exploit.The next thing you’ll know is you’ve had data stolen, or ransomware injected into your systems, or maybe you’re mining bitcoin for someone else. And all it took for you to expose your systems to these risks was a few mouse clicks.To really know what you are doing takes a lot of practice, and practice makes perfect. We have all seen those job adverts where companies are looking for ‘rock stars’ and ‘cloud ninjas’; while these fanciful job titles might seem ridiculous on the surface, competent cloud professionals aren’t far from rock stars or ninjas in terms of their value to your organization.Doing things with limited knowledge ties you to certain solutions which might not be optimal and might be too complicated; with complicated solutions you run the risk of not knowing which resources you are actually running.My take on all this is that you need to know your cloud solutions inside out, like the back of your own hand, if you’re going to be able to make them simple and secure. Here’s where automation ­– one of the cornerstones of every modern cloud deployment worth its salt – comes in. And if your vendor is doing cloud deployments from a graphical user interface let’s have a chat and I can pinpoint all the issues that come with this way of doing things.With these fundamentals, the cloud just became saferThe robots are comingAutomation brings stability, traceability, and repeatability to the cloud. And it should be implemented to the max wherever possible.I cannot emphasize enough the importance of automation; it doesn’t matter what the tool is – if it gets the job done and manages version control, that is key.Automation brings with it the possibility to track what changes have been made, who made them, when they made them, and why. This provides a comprehensive audit trail that we can use to minimize those “oopsie” moments to some extent.Automation bundled with a cloud-native way of doing things means double the benefit as you can have more control over the resources used to run your applications. You can scale resources on a more granular level to meet the needs of your users, and when there is a quiet moment you can scale down to the bare minimum. Deploying new environments can be automated and done straight from the development team Kanban board, and, vice versa, once an environment is no longer needed it can be removed automatically.I have a dark past in on-premises computing and it is mind-boggling how quickly the landscape has changed – and I think this is just the beginning. We are on cloud v1 and once AI and the cloud’s next phase hit full speed there is no room for old school.In the next blog in this series I’ll delve a little deeper into some easy steps you can to take to secure your environment.Time to modernize to cloud", Toni Kuokkanen ,Cybersecurity insights , 8.10.2021
How to get true security – a modern SOC responds to modern threats,/en/blog/2021/09/How-to-get-true-security-a-modern-SOC-responds-to-modern-threats/,Cybersecurity insights / Mikael Fryksten / 3.10.2021,"In today's world of constantly evolving cybersecurity threats and challenges, a modern Security Operations Center may be the best bet your company could make to keep functioning and stay safe from harm.The SOC in a nutshellThe idea behind the SOC is for it to operate as a separate unit that concentrates on keeping the company secure at all times. An SOC deals with security issues both on a technical level and on the business side of the organization. It consists of people, processes and technology that work together to enhance the organization's security posture.In essence, an SOC is a collection of top-level experts and intelligent threat detection and automation technology. It can help in making your company more resilient when facing modern threats. Both the IT security experts and business operations people work together to mitigate the risks that security challenges pose to business continuity.An SOC can be an internal unit, especially in a big corporation. However, it is often beneficial to outsource the security operations and buy your SOC as a service. This way the company can concentrate on its core business, while top experts take care of threats.Post-Covid changes and the information explosionThe enterprises' digital environment has seen massive growth in data. For example, a huge amount of telemetry data is created every second by a multitude of sensors and devices.As the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, the field is constantly evolving. This poses great challenges for security, as the number and types of assets to be monitored are extremely varied. This telemetry explosion complicates everyday cybersecurity and its management.As businesses have increasingly moved to the cloud, a whole new category of threat models and attacks have emerged. This requires new kinds of solutions for defending your company against cyber criminals.The huge increase in remote work during the past year and a half has also raised new concerns. When most of a company's employees work from home – and probably will continue hybrid work even after the pandemic is over – security challenges are very different than in the traditional office environment.Automation is the key to good securityThese rapid changes mean that security must adapt fast. The attackers and the attacks are growing more sophisticated all the time. So you need the right mix of technology and people who are able to detect current threats and know how to deal with them.For SOCs, this means that there must be good capabilities for automation, so that the experts can concentrate on providing security information to the business instead of doing routine tasks. Automation also minimizes human error and facilitates the proactive management of security.A truly capable SOC will amplify its offering with anticipation and foresight. When an incident does happen, the SOC will be able to concentrate its monitoring efforts on threats that are relevant at that moment in time. Knowing that your company is in safe hands means you can sleep better at night.Want to know how to build resilient security for your company? Contact our experts.Want to learn more?

Bring DataOps to life with the help of data warehouse automation,/en/blog/2021/09/bring-dataops-to-life-with-the-help-of-data-warehouse-automation/,Data / Teemu Ekola / 30.9.2021,"Challenges with traditional data warehousingMany of us have witnessed companies deal with plenty of issues that arise from poor data models. A very typical problem is that the model has grown over time and the dependencies within a model are numerous, which makes the model maintenance exhausting. Another typical problem is that the model doesn’t reflect to real life anymore. Over time, the business environment has changed, but there has not been a possibility to refactor the model. Things are handled with short cuts and exceptions.The knowledge of these peculiarities lies within very few people who have lived throughout the model development. For everyone else, it is difficult to see why the data model is built the way it is. When these few people leave the company, others struggle to take over and understand the data model, and it might set the company back to square one with their data.Traditional ways of doing data modeling and warehousing do not really support business involvement or agile teamwork. Maybe due to the technical nature of data warehousing, it became purely an IT department task in many companies in the past. As a result, organizations often find themselves in a situation where business and IT are miles apart and data development lacks focus and ownership.Incremental improvements to data model made easy with the Data Vault paradigmThe root cause behind these problems is that changing a data model is a wearing task. The Data Vault modelling embraces the idea that data models change and expand over time. The Data Vault methodology enables incremental changes and frequent updates to the data model. The approach requires discipline, as modelling work needs to be done meticulously and correctly. Cutting corners at this point would sabotage the model. Also, changing the model frequently introduces more possibilities for human error.A good data warehouse automation tool helps to overcome these issues, leverage the pros of a Data Vault, and essentially take the necessary steps towards DataOps.DataOps (data operations) refers to an operating model that uses various personnel roles to support data-driven business development. Read a more in-depth definition of DataOps.A visual data warehouse automation tool brings business and IT togetherAutomating the SQL generation needed in Data Vault development is something that many companies have noticed necessary when trying to build a Data Vault. There are multiple tools out in the market to automate this task. But why to settle just for techie type of scripting automation when it is possible to bring along an enterprise grade, visual data warehouse automation platform which is able to drastically change the data warehousing from IT department’s rehearsal to collaborative, business driven effort.DataOps is about agile way of working (1), DevOps practices (2) and there is definitely a need for an automation tool (3) to enable frequent changes and multiple environments. The fourth ingredient in DataOps is the data understanding. And because data is a footprint of the business, the business needs to be involved.When you choose a data warehouse automation tool with a visual interface and graphic data modelling capabilities, more people from the organization can participate in the data warehouse development. A good tool will not change your organization, but surely provides a good foundation to build on the cultural change towards genuine DataOps.For me, this kind of democratization of data is one of the most exciting prospects that modern data warehouse automation brings. We are already witnessing steps that are moving data development further from hardcore coding and towards shared business development. Who knows, maybe in a few years the competences of business analysts include data engineering.Datavault Builder helps turn data warehousing into an agile collaborative effortTietoEVRY partnered up with 2150 GmbH, and we can now support our customers in modernizing and automating the datawarehouse development using Datavault Builder automation tool.Read more about the partnership.The Datavault Builder automates work and brings efficiency into data warehouse lifecycle. For organizations ready to delve deeper into the opportunities of data-driven business, the Datavault Builder is a tool for modernizing their data warehouse development to business driven, collaborative effort while providing improved efficiency in the maintenance phase.Here is how the Datavault Builder changes the ways of working:No coding expertise needed. Visual models and reporting means that there is no need for SQL expertise to be able to participate in the development. Business and IT people share an understanding, and everyone can contribute irrelevant of their coding skills.Faster time to value for business. As the Datavault Builder enables incremental improvement of the data model, the modelling work doesn’t have to be finished (nor can it be) before it starts to provide insight for better decision making.Flexible teamwork on the data model. Integrated version control allows different teams to work on the data model simultaneously, and the changes can be easily merged.Built-in features cover many phases of data warehouse development. The Datavault Builder features eliminate need of separate tools as it covers functionality for designing the data model, building data integrations (ETLs), scheduling integrations and documenting the model. This brings cost-efficiency and streamlines work.“Migration from legacy data warehouses to modern, cloud-based data warehouses with Datavault Builder takes less time and money than many expect.

Reinventing card platforms during banking’s radical change,/en/blog/2021/09/reinventing-card-platforms-during-bankings-radical-change/,Digitalization / Hans Sjölund / 21.9.2021,"Retail banking - from branch to digitalMany of us might remember a retail bank branch from 20 or even 30 years ago: a reassuringly traditional institution with strict opening times, lines of customers waiting to speak to advisors or tellers and, in the background somewhere, a huge steel door leading to the vault where the money was kept.Fast forward two decades, and banking is digital. Almost three-quarters of Europeans now bank online, and 66% shop online at least part of the time, according to research from PCM[1]. PCM’s research details how branch banking has declined by half over the last 20 years, with further declines predicted to 2030. In other words, we’re in the middle of a shift to fully digital banking – which means transactions are faster, shopping is done via a laptop or mobile device, and security concerns shift front and centre as fraud migrates to the digital channel. It also means customers now expect very high levels of service, including the instant delivery of innovative, digital-first approaches.Time to change platformIn our new white paper, we explain why and how the card business has to reinvent itself to keep pace with this once-in-a-lifetime change. At a time when retail banks are under intense pressure to improve margins and rationalise their services, the profitability of card programmes is declining as issuers grapple with complex legacy technologies and rising costs in several areas. Our research in the UK and Nordics[2] shows consumers continue to see contactless cards as their go-to payment method – but this means issuers must take decisive steps to ensure their card platforms are fit for tomorrow’s digital-first economy.Most issuers employ a wide range of card management software platforms, each built to serve different systems, business units or geographies. Using multiple card platforms is inefficient and time-consuming when it comes to rolling out new services or responding to the growing range of regulatory requirements our industry faces. What’s more, it also increases operational risk as each platform requires individual attention to maintain regulatory compliance and interoperability. The risk of system failure also grows as these platforms become older and more vulnerable.The answer to these complexities is to rationalise the many card platforms issuers use into one integrated solution. In doing so, banks will cut the cost of issuing cards and control fluctuations in revenue from card issuing as all activity passes through one fully integrated platform. They can also reduce the amount of time and money spent maintaining regulatory compliance across multiple platforms, while introducing new technologies such as instant card issuing and mobile optimisation gets easier. Products are delivered to market more rapidly, compliance is simplified and the up-front investment in developing a new card platform is reduced.The best route to rationalisationTo date, digitisation has taken traditional banks too long and has been partial at best. Rationalising card platforms makes sense as part of a wider change to fully digital banking; it also helps free up capital and resources for innovation in other areas. As banks rush headlong to “go digital”, they should not ignore the fundamental changes needed in their existing business.Our new white paper explains why the optimal means of rationalising card platforms is to embed a proven solution modified to suit a bank’s individual needs using Software as a Service (SaaS) as the delivery model. By taking the SaaS option, banks can improve their speed to market and adapt rapidly to changing regulatory demands.Traditional retail banks are currently facing an existential threat from “digital-only” banks, which are predicted to treble in size by 2030[3]. Given such intense competition, a piecemeal approach to digitisation is not a winning strategy. Banks must rationalise their card platforms to optimise operational efficiency and service delivery. By outsourcing tasks such as platform updates and compliance requirements to an expert third-party partner they can trust, banks will be free to create and deliver innovative products that enhance their customers’ experience and improve loyalty.To download a copy of “The race to digital: why banks must rationalise card platforms”, click HERE.[1] See the Digital and Card Payments Yearbooks 2020-2021 at www.paymentyearbooks.com[2] See: https://www.tietoevry.com/en/newsroom/all-news-and-releases/press-releases/2021/03/time-for-biometric-security-on-contactless-cards-new-research-from-tietoevry-reveals-uk-consumers-contactless-concerns/[3] See UK Tech News, 12 July 2021: “Traditional banks could be reduced to storage vaults”: https://uktechnews.co.uk/2021/07/12/traditional-banks-will-be-reduced-to-storage-vaults-by-2030-unless-they-move-away-from-a-one-size-fits-nobody-digital-approach-quadient-warns/", Hans Sjölund ,Digitalization , 21.9.2021
TietoEVRY continues to deliver market leading fraud prevention and customer experiences,/en/blog/2021/09/tietoevry-continues-to-deliver-market-leading-fraud-prevention-and-customer-experiences/,Cybersecurity insights / Simen Berg / 17.9.2021,"This unique combination provides TietoEVRY’s customers with operational efficiency, effective end-customer interactions, fewer false positives, and shared costs on compliance and technological development.Close to one hundred satisfied customers are already enjoying the lowest basis points in the market, monitoring and reporting in compliance with PSD2, and saving millions of Euros each year through TietoEVRY’s fraud prevention service. As an example, DNB enjoyed a 98% detection rate on card fraud in 2020. Due to the high detection rate, below one percent of cards issued by the bank were actually subject to fraud.TietoEVRY’s calculations suggest that implementing a managed service for monitoring payment card transactions and accounts can save customers between 25% and 60% in operational costs. Moreover, utilizing consortia rule sharing enables TietoEVRY to detect fraud faster, protecting payment service users and organizations from criminal activity more efficiently.Efficiency and effectivenessAt TietoEVRY we offer an alternative to high running costs and heavy technology investments. Through our extensive experience in running financial crime prevention operations for our customers, we have created an optimal setup for leveraging the latest technology in line with regulatory demands. Combining different transaction types in a multi-tenant monitoring utility, we can detect patterns at entity and network level, creating opportunities to share threat patterns across customer portfolios.One of the key benefits of a multi-tenant managed service is having both depth and range in data, making it possible to see both the finer details and the big picture. Combined with the intelligence provided by our customers and partners is vital to us. It means our systems and staff are far better equipped to deal with changes than they would be if looking at a single portfolio.In our managed service, highly trained investigators work 24/7/365 on monitoring emerging risk patterns together with machine learning algorithms and AI. As soon as the system detect or stop a specific transaction, our response team will notify your end client.", Simen Berg ,Cybersecurity insights , 17.9.2021
Taking the cloud-native approach into the DNA of telecom application and infrastructure development,/en/blog/2021/09/taking-the-cloud-native-approach-into-the-dna-of-telecom-application-and-infrastructure-development/,Cloud / Harri  Salomaa / 16.9.2021,"Cloud-native helps to increase operational efficiency in complex and multivendor software development and life-cycle management. Our entire telecom software engineering team is aligned with a cloud-native approach to enable elastic and resilient telecommunication infrastructure and scalable applications. The key benefit is accelerated and automated software deployment into the networks.What does the true cloud-native approach mean?We follow the cloud-native best practices and take full ownership of the infrastructure on which applications are running. In engineering terms, we run apps by hiding the ""physical"" Infra behind APIs, management, and orchestration software. This means that our customers can make more flexible vendor choices regarding compute, networking, and storage.Telecommunication companies believe strongly in the benefits of microservices and container-based architectures, and so do we. With many of our clients, we develop and deploy self-healing applications. When each microservice is autonomous and independent, it is easy to monitor and upgrade a service without impacting others.However, cloud-native is not just about microservices. Nor is cloud-native infrastructure the same as running apps in a container and using container orchestration, even though they provide several advantageous features needed in cloud-native infrastructure. In the cloud-native infrastructure, we can effectively manage both monolithic and microservices if need be.What is cloud-native’s role in Telecom?Cloud-native means that applications must be as platform-agnostic as possible and run on various designs. Almost all telecommunication service providers have a tailor-made infrastructure setup and configuration. The benefit of cloud-native goes way beyond new feature development, for example, in 5G. It also provides a way to make older technologies such as 4G/LTE more flexible in terms of hardware choices, and it increases capabilities for enterprise IoT mobility.The cloud-native approach and best practices are not tightly connected with the underlying architecture and infrastructure. Therefore, they are also adaptable to all kinds of infrastructure configurations from on-prem to hybrid and private/public clouds.In this hectic transformation, it is gratifying that we need not rewrite all existing software as a microservice. Instead, we can make it more hardware agnostic and run it on cloud-native infrastructure.Some areas where our telecom software experts are active:Infra and Applications development for the telecommunications industry: 5G, Data Centres, Apps, Network HW, SoC providers, Service Providers, OSS/BSS, and Open-Source Communities
Cloud DevOps: creating, configuring, and tuning various development environments, continuous integration, and delivery frameworks, toolchains as cloud services, integration services, and driving architecture for cloud-based R&D
Free and Open-source software such as OpenStack and Kubernetes, targeted for telecom cloud-native and network functions virtualisation infrastructures
Modular designs simplify the adoption
Network management and orchestration, including embedded operations & management, and Open Networking Automation Platform (ONAP)
Cloud-native telecom technologies, such as CloudRAN/vRAN/O-RANThe cloud-native delivery model is a critical enabler to gaining the best out of provisioning and managing telecom cloud resources. The right tools for the cloud-native delivery model allow an increased speed of new feature deployment – and accelerated time-to-market for getting new services out quickly.Learn more about Telecom cloud-native development.", Harri  Salomaa ,Cloud , 16.9.2021
Government to citizen payments – is it time to switch to real-time transactions?,/en/blog/2021/09/government-to-citizen-payments--is-it-time-to-switch-to-real-time-transactions/,Digitalization / Edgars Bremze  / 15.9.2021,"Today, people expect to be able to access resources and services quickly and effectively. The public sector is no different, instant access to funds can be essential to ensure the safe and speedy financial recovery of individuals, particularly in a crisis.Some governments have already acted. The Australian government, for instance, developed a new real-time payments platform some years ago that enables its citizen to get faster access to government payments. In a crisis, such as flooding or forest fires, citizens can receive financial assistance in a matter of seconds. Such immediate action is now a key part of the country’s emergency response.In the US, the resilience of the country’s payment infrastructure, FedNow Service, was put to the test as billions of dollars in COVID emergency relief payments were issued nationwide. Emergency relief payments were particularly important for households and small businesses with cash flow constraints.When a crisis occurs, it’s important to have a well-functioning government to citizen payment system in place. However, the benefits reach far beyond this.Banking for the unbankedGovernments that provide access to digital solutions and payments bring inclusion to society, by supporting the unbanked, often the poorest demographic in a county. This enables payments to be made, for instance, into accounts or pre-paid cards. In Pakistan, for example, the government has recently announced the launch of Raast, an instant digital payment system. This will be used for government payments, including pensions as well as national financial support programs.Even if financial inclusion is not a prime goal, by switching from cash to electronic government payments, support for national retail payment systems becomes inherent. Such a structural impact will undoubtedly lead to a stronger case for improved access and usage of transaction accounts.The future – cashless societies and central digital currenciesThe move to cashless societies and the growing interest in Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDS) – a digital form of cash issued by a central bank and backed by country reserves –should also be an important consideration.Many governments are investigating the possibility of creating their own digital currencies, such as the Swedish e-krona. CBDC’s would enable citizens and indeed businesses to have accounts linked directly to central banks from which government can make direct payments. Again, this would offer inclusivity to the unbanked. The same accounts could be linked to commercial banks to ensure governments are not competing with the private sector.No matter what happens, the rise of virtual currencies has meant that for many governments it has become a question of when rather than if to launch a CBDC. With that in mind, any new payment infrastructure development should support them. Extending the use of central bank money, i.e., CBDCs could allow central banks to meet future payment requirements and enhance cross-border payments, while promoting new innovations.Choosing the right payment infrastructureBy looking at user behaviour we can see that typically, somebody who receives government payments withdraws the full amount once it’s deposited. One reason for this is the nature of the payment products used. These tend to be basic single payment services with limited functionality, in other words, they are not user-centric. However, research by the World Bank found that when able to choose a service provider, a recipient of government payments is far more likely to keep a certain amount of funds in their accounts. Furthermore, they are likely to remain a customer of the service provider and test different digital features connected to the account.To that end, for the good of the market, it’s vital that a single closed-loop payment scheme is not able to dominate a market. Markets require an open, interoperable national payment infrastructure that can be leveraged by any market participant – banks, payment service providers and businesses. An open infrastructure like this can ensure citizens have the opportunity to choose their preferred way to receive payments.In summary,The way in which government payment programs impact and influence public welfare should not be underestimated. From supporting the unbanked to granting instant access in a crisis to changing the way citizens interact with government payments, they all make an enormous difference to society.At the same time, governments also have a role to play in stimulating the investments being made in instant payment infrastructures, which will ultimately also have a positive impact on citizens.At TietoEVRY we understand what is required to build reliable and robust payment infrastructures that serve the needs of a nation. Developing a new payment scheme is complex but when done correctly, offers many benefits. Our experts can help you design the right system for your needs based on benchmarks from around the world.From strategic plans to launch and maintenance, we make sure you and your citizens benefit from instant payments, long-term.

Human-centric approach for a humane cause,/en/blog/2021/09/human-centric-approach-for-a-humane-cause/,Digitalization / Aleksi Kärkkäinen / 13.9.2021,"Organisations both big and small often overlook this question. Instead, they build the platform around the team’s internal needs and slowly get carried away from the customer. The digital development becomes a guessing game and the patchwork result only faintly answers customer needs.Startup Refugees evaded this common pitfall by placing the user first from the start. The organisation, founded in 2015, is a social innovation group that aims to connect immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees with employers. These job seekers upload their professional history and network with employers on the digital platform “Match”. And Startup Refugees even offers resume workshops for job seekers to succeed on their platform. This standout catering to customer needs is no accident, as from the beginning, Startup Refugees involved users in the design and development process. In other words, they kept the user central.In 2018 TietoEVRY embarked on a joint journey with Startup Refugees to fight against digital inequality and to help in building more equal societies. In the spring 2021 the collaboration continued by planning the future of Match tool. In the span of two months, TietoEVRY conducted a series of stakeholder interviews, co-design sessions, and UX/code analyses. This deep dive into “Match” culminated with the creation of a step-by-step guide for the future user-centred development of the platform. The report gave a new direction for the development team and a review of future user experience features. We were driven by understanding the users and their needs, so instead of resorting to guessing, the team worked through an empathetic approach to build understanding and provide useful recommendations.Elisa Vepsäläinen, CEO of Startup Refugees, appreciated how “The work with TietoEVRY enabled Startup Refugees to get clarification where we are and how to develop Match further.”Our tips for better user understanding to enhance user experience:Get close to the customerMany organisations avoid going to the customers for advice. They fear burdening their clients or coming across as unprofessional. But this could not be further from the truth. Customers want to feel valued and heard, enabling them to directly impact the products and services they buy. Additionally, organisations gain an opportunity to gather feedback on their assumptions and even accumulate new user innovations.The quick pace of the project with Startup Refugees prevented us from interviewing direct users. Instead, the team approached the frontline experts who frequently interacted with and helped the users. Their insights illuminated the needed digital platform improvements and enabled agile design work.Don’t give homeworkNo one likes homework. It is tempting for the design team to use questionnaires and other fillable materials to gather insights. But surveys often go unanswered. They are often half-heartedly filled an hour before the deadline or in five minutes before leaving work for home.Instead, focus on in-person (or online) interviews, where conversations are agile, easy, and responsive. This proved to be extremely effective with Startup Refugees. Participants showed up full of excitement and energy to co-design sessions. Everyone took their turn to talk, share, and ideate on the spot. And so, the TietoEVRY team got the undivided attention of numerous participants with a wealth of user insight.Prep to succeedWe all love to ideate solutions, swiftly passing thoughts back and forth until a key idea springs up. But in service design, this process can easily carry us away from the root issues. It is critical to simultaneously ensure the foundations of the project are up to date and will support new user-centred ideas.For Startup Refugees, this meant early attention to the code of the “Match” platform. In fact, our user-centred guideline for its future development heavily emphasised fixing and strengthening the code bedrock before building new user features on it.Ideation alone can fall apart at the technicalities, so a well-wrought and prepared pathway is the surest road to success.In sum, the accomplishments of digital design depend on the organisations’ ability to look beyond itself. Shift your sight away from internal pushes and pulls and turn it towards the customer. Address the customer needs first. How? Speak to the customer and to those who know the customer.

Workday Implementations: Five post go-live considerations,/en/blog/2021/09/workday-implementations-five-post-go-live-considerations/,Cloud / Ian Strachan / 9.9.2021,"After go-live when we often take a moment to reflect on the lessons learned, all the hard work and dedication that implementations need, and begin to gain the benefits of the Unified Platform that is Workday.The nature of agile projects is of course that we focus on the most important decisions to keep moving in a timely fashion. This means multiple items will remain, post go-live for your attention, and these will need a structured, mindful approach.So, during the implementation project, what did you postpone, either decisions entirely, or to delay implementing decisions that were made, so that you kept your project on budget, on time and in scope?Equally, you now need to maintain the new HR system, keep it aligned with your business, and working fluently and efficiently. There are many topics to take into consideration, so let me help you to identify the most crucial areas.1. Business ProcessesFundamentally, processes run systems - that has, and probably always will be the case. During your implementation project, decisions were made about how your processes must flow. It may be that the decisions were taken while your Workday knowledge was still in its early stages, or to simply reflect your existing “ways of working”. Perhaps compromises and workarounds were needed to achieve this?Now that your Workday knowledge has progressed, and project deadlines are not looming, try to consider, can your processes be built in a more advantageous way?Further, now that you are experiencing first-hand how Workday’s self-service functionality can facilitate greater involvement by managers and employees, and as user familiarity increases, this may anyway be the right time to start considering process improvements.Combining these two reviews of your configured processes can give good value, whether this is done internally, or with the help of your chosen consulting resource.Lastly, post go-live, be very clear about who will own each process, and make this information available to your users. Clarity of ownership ensures your user community can efficiently feedback any issues found, driving further improvements and, critically, enhancing user engagement.2. SecurityAs we move from project kick-off to life in production, the overall security configuration can become quite complex. Complexity impacts system performance and the ability to efficiently resolve new issues as they arrive, post go-live. Consequently, you should review your security configuration again soon after go-live - a holistic, top-down view can provide insight into inconsistencies, and layers of complexity that are no longer required.If you are not confident in achieving a good level of depth in your security analysis internally, ask for a review from your post-production support partner. You should receive improvement and simplification suggestions, ensuring your system performs as efficiently and effectively as possible.And of course, Workday is a living breathing system which you will no doubt develop over time. Complexity can lead to errors finding their way into your configuration as changes are made, even in disparate areas.Workday delivers a security exception audit report which is a very good diagnostic tool. This shows separately domain, business process and security group errors, and should also be reviewed regularly.Depending on the volume of changes you typically are making, it might also be time-efficient to build out your own custom reports. These can even trigger alerts to your security administrator, so that you can mitigate any impact if errors do occur.3. IntegrationsNo man or woman is an island, and neither is Workday. Data flows in and out of Workday in multiple ways, be it manual re-keying, via mass loads or by integration.During the project, budgetary considerations may mean some integrations were avoided, causing your “business as usual” to require more manual effort than necessary.Naturally, any time user intervention is required, a risk of error, however small, is present, plus manual effort takes time from users that might otherwise be used more productively.Conversely, if you integrate any data flow as much possible, errors found can be resolved and avoided completely in future, and you empower your most valuable resource, your people, to instead focus on more valuable tasks, driving value into the business.Revisit those project decisions, and review the amount of time being used for manual work, the volume of errors that are occurring and the impacts of these errors. You may find that the cost of implementing those backlogged integrations is outweighed by the advantages they bring.4. Feature ReleasesWorkday feature releases happen twice per year, so at least one feature release will usually be delivered during your implementation project.Your implementation partner will typically be hands on with an impact analysis, including regression testing of this new release during the project. Typically the focus is on ensuring everything continues to function as expected and per the decisions made before this new release.However, each new release brings additional functionality and improvements that could be of great value. While these may have been sidelined during the project, it is advisable to revisit these to understand where we can derive maximum value from our investment.Partnering with your chosen post-production support resource is invaluable here in assessing the cross-functional impacts these may bring, and ensuring the options are fully understood, pitfalls are avoided and new functionality can be taken into use in a timely fashion.5. End User ExperienceUser adoption and engagement is a key deliverable for any successful project and is affected strongly by delivering targeted user training for your new system.Be mindful of your audience and try to create training content and approach accordingly. If your users are likely to access Workday infrequently, consider whether simple, clear documentation or in system guidance might be the most appropriate format, along with a very light training session and incentivise users to begin using the system.Conversely, if you are training your internal HR, Financial or IT resources, perhaps a deeper, hands-on test environment might be more effective. Potentially your Sandbox Preview tenant could be utilised, however you may be concerned about data visibility or security. If so, speak to your post-production support partner about the possibility of provisioning a separate testing tenant, with scrambled data or even just sample data.Also, compared to legacy systems, Workday improves user experience, we see this again and again. But backlogged development items can often be the difference between an improved user experience and an amazing one. Those “nice to haves” from the project often relate to user experience, while you focused on processes, data integrity, compliance etc.Do not ignore these, they can be a game-changer for your employee satisfaction statistics.Honorary Mention: ReportingAnd one last thing (I know, that’s six areas not five, but think of this as across all areas rather than its own).Do not forget to use Reporting. Workday delivers hundreds of excellent reports across all areas, but let your internal reporting resources or your partner consultants know your wildest reporting dreams.In many HR systems, creating and updating reports can be a huge effort, taking many weeks for results that are “nearly there”. Workday makes reporting upon, and analysing, your data possible in ways that previously required multiple systems, HR and Financial data sources, Excel, PowerPoint, etc., with users needing advanced skills in each.With Workday, the ability to analyse your line of business data is far more achievable, directly within Workday itself. Even that one report you always thought would never be possible.But don’t settle for possible… go further, go get amazing, and wow your people!Do you need help ensuring your Workday setup develops with your business, or perhaps any of the issues discussed here resonate with you?If so, or to simply discuss how Tietoevry can be of service, contact us via the contact form.", Ian Strachan ,Cloud , 9.9.2021
How close are we to urban automated driving?,/en/blog/2021/09/how-close-are-we-to-urban-automated-driving/,Digitalization / Mohamed  Harb  / 9.9.2021,"About five years ago there were many startups declaring their programs and presenting demos alongside big automotive OEMs and Tier1s. Consolidation initiatives started when startups began realising the challenges and related costs of evolving demonstrations to a safely running industrial product, and we are still on that path today. When I look at the current progress, I don’t see the aspiration of having autonomous vehicles on urban roads on a large scale with a profitable business model becoming a reality within at least the next seven years.Safety is the main challenge in L3 autonomous drivingSafety is certainly the main challenge. OEMs won't risk jeopardising their brand with fatal safety incidences. As there are plenty of critical safety requirements, the cost for both development and deployment are major concerns. Besides rigorous testing, there are additional demands like safety-by-design, such as redundancy. As a result, the cost of development and the cost of a final product can easily rise to a level that makes it very challenging to establish a profitable business model.Towards more affordable automated drivingMostly the development is trying to solve automated driving-related challenges mainly at the vehicle level. However, especially when it comes to an urban environment, the challenges ahead are too large to be solved only from a vehicle side. I believe that a more holistic approach including other technologies and the surrounding environment will significantly help to realise automated driving in urban settings.Our experience in V2X projects showcases the benefits of taking advantage of telecom technologies such as 5G and increased computing power with edge computing. Infrastructure plays a key role in enabling urban automated driving and speeds up time to market. Most importantly, it can be a solution for a profitable business model.We showcased a case example and ideas at the event on the 16th of September, ScaleUp 360° Advanced Driver Assistance Systems Europe.

Data lakes and warehouses part 2: Databricks and Snowflake,/en/blog/2021/09/data-lakes-and-warehouses-databricks-snowflake/,Data / Timo Aho / 7.9.2021,"To get the background into the topic, please read my previous blog post about the data lake and data warehouse paradigms.Blog seriesData lakes and warehouses part 1: Intro to paradigmsData lakes and warehouses part 2: Databricks and SnowflakeData lakes and warehouses part 3: Azure Synapse point of viewData lakes and warehouses part 4: ChallengesAs we learnt in the previous post, data analytics platform can be divided into multiple stages. Above, we can see a picture giving a general understanding of roles for Snowflake and Databricks in the pipelines. Here we can categorize the tools to either processing (green) or storage (blue). Databricks is a processing tool and Snowflake covers both processing and storage. Delta lake, on the other hand, is a storage solution related to Databricks. We will cover it later.According to the definitions given in the previous article, we can roughly say that Databricks is a data lake based tool and Snowflake is a data warehouse based tool. Let us now dig a bit deeper into these tools.Databricks is a data lake tool with data warehouse features­Databricks is an Apache Spark based processing tool that provides programming environment with highly and automatically scalable computing capacity. Apache Spark is the de facto standard programming framework for coding based big data processing.Databricks billing is essentially usage based. You pay for the used computational resources and nothing else. In principle, Databricks is particularly suitable for processing data in the early stages of a pipeline, especially between bronze and silver layers. It can also be used for preparing gold layer data but is not at its best in providing data for, say, reporting tools.Recently, Databricks has significantly extended its capabilities to the direction of a traditional data warehouse. Databricks provides a ready-made SQL query interface and a lightweight visualization layer. In addition, Databricks offers a database type table structure. The database type functionality is specifically developed with Delta file format.Delta file format is an approach for taking database strengths into the data lake world. The format provides, among others, a data schema versioning and database type ACID transactions. In accordance with the data lake paradigm, the file format itself is open and free to be exploited by anyone.Based on Delta format and Databricks tool, the company is trying to spread a notion of a novel “Data Lakehouse” paradigm for a data lake and data warehouse hybrid approach.Snowflake is a scalable data warehouse drawing from the data lake paradigmSnowflake is a scalable data warehouse solution developed specifically for cloud environments. Snowflake stores data in a cloud storage in a proprietary file format. The data is therefore only available through Snowflake, according to the data warehouse paradigm. In addition to computational resources, you also pay for the data storage in the Snowflake file format. However, you also have the typical data warehouse features like granular permission management available.Snowflake disrupted the data warehouse market a few years ago by offering highly distributed and scalable computation capacity. This is done by completely separating storage and processing layers in the data warehouse architecture. Traditionally, this has been a major obstacle for data warehouse solutions in the big data world. This is one of the ways Snowflake is expanding its solution in the direction of the data lake paradigm. Nowadays it offers, among others, efficient tools for real-time data ingestion.It is probably not an overstatement to say that the success of Snowflake caused a crisis in Amazon Redshift and Azure Data Warehouse development. Scalability of the latter two data warehouse solutions was significantly more restricted: If you wanted to avoid high expenses, you needed to choose between small storage capacity or slow processing. Very often, a suitable combination was difficult to find. Thus, you usually paid a significant amount of money for reserve resources you did not actually use. Nevertheless, both the products have taken steps towards solving this issue.Conclusions: Databricks and SnowflakeIn this post we discussed two very popular multi-cloud data analytics products: Databricks and Snowflake. We specifically studied them from the viewpoint of their background paradigms as discussed in the previous blog post.We noted that Snowflake has a basis in data warehouse world while Databricks is more data lake oriented. However, both have extended their reach beyond typical limits of their paradigms.Both tools can definitely be used alone to fulfill the needs of a data analytics platform. Databricks can serve data directly from a storage or export data into data marts. There is no need for a separate data warehouse. On the other hand, data can be ingested directly to Snowflake for processing, modeling, and offering. In my experience, pure Snowflake solutions are more common, perhaps because Databricks has not been around for so long.However, as brought up in the previous post, it might be a good idea to use both of the products in a single platform. The breakdown of this kind of solution is depicted in the picture with Databricks reading and processing raw data and Snowflake taking care of the publishing end of a pipeline. It is also important to note that Databricks and Snowflake are doing collaboration for better integration between the products.All in all, future seems even brighter for hybrid solutions.", Timo Aho ,Data , 7.9.2021
SIAM: Delivering value in multisource environment,/en/blog/2021/09/SIAM-Delivering-value-in-multisource-environment/,Cloud / Sudhendu Chaturvedi  / 7.9.2021,"This enables the business to have a clear line of sight and extract value that it wishes to from the provisioned services.However, the question on how the value can be derived from a complex chain of services and suppliers remains for the business. The outcome generally is a perception wrought with confusions and IT is seen as inhibitor for the business, which lacks both proper governance and end to end visibility. Bypassing of IT by different Lines of Business becomes the norm of the day which results in an incomplete picture of services, hard to measure service levels and provide performance visibility.SIAM plays a major role in ensuring business objectives are aligned and achieved. Henceforth, we explore how SIAM helps different stakeholders achieve the desired outcomes.Value for Business ITThe Business IT has a demand for answers to specific questions. Some of these are:How can the demands of the business be met in today's digital world froth with immense complexities?
How can business reduce operational risk and cost?
How can business prepare for tomorrow and manage rapid changes in the digital environment?SIAM answers these with providing a management methodology that in turn provides a robust approach helping in sourcing, integrating and managing specialist services, applications & support form external service providers. It allows for a flexible sourcing and service provider models which help reduce operational risk and cost, improve the ability to meet the demands of the business with an integrated and seamless approach. The integrated approach thus achieved from SIAM, helps in realizing a single business facing IT service organization for the End users. Further to the above:SIAM introduces service integrator as a capability which provides overall Governance, metrics and management for better handling of supplier ecosystem.
It provides guidance at Strategic, Tactical and Operational level which allows the Customer to manage and visualize the supplier ecosystem in a better and cohesive fashion
It has the mandate to introduce standardization of processes, tools and technologies which translates to improved overall performance, better operational and financial discipline and improved satisfaction of business usersValue for Centralized ITThe centralized IT, owing to its specific nature of responsibilities, also looks for a way of working that alleviates its pain points. Some of which are:What is the performance of service providers and how can it be improved?
How can the performance of suppliers be reported and measured?
How can providers and their contracts be aligned towards larger business objectives?SIAM, through its operating model, provides a template for the IT to easily put in place best practices and achieve its objectives that further align with greater business demands. SIAM, through its Governance at operational, tactical and strategic levels, helps bring standardized metrics for the supplier ecosystem. It helps provide an integrated performance management system to help customer understand and manage the overall service provisioned by their partners / suppliers. SIAM thus helps the IT to have a robust structure in place and a clear oversight of the performance of the environment.Value for Partners / SuppliersIn the current multi sourced environment, Suppliers play a crucial role where they now help co-create value with their customers. In such an environment, Suppliers must not only understand and align with their customers’ strategic objectives but also work with other suppliers to provision services that are seamless.However, most of the times this alignment is not realized as Partners work in silos with less to no sight of strategic objectives. Some of the questions that arise from such way of working are:Why should I care what other vendors do, if I deliver activities in my scope?
Why should I connect with SIAM when I can enjoy direct relationship with Customer?
Why should I share data with the SIAM provider?SIAM, through its Service Integrator capability, provides platforms for Partners / Suppliers to integrate and understand the overall service provisioning for the customer. This helps demolish the silos and create an environment of true collaboration. It also helps institute Forums and Workgroups where Partners / Suppliers can engage and coordinate with each other to better achieve the said collaboration. The collaborative approach thus achieved helps the Supplier ecosystem to both understand and achieve desired business outcomes.Value for End UserAt the end of the day, it’s the End user who consumes the services and therefore wants the concerns addressed. The demand for consistent customer experience is default and hence some of the questions arising from the community are:My request takes so long because of multiple providers
When there is an issue, whom to approach and how?
How to ensure my workstation has necessary applications, always connected and secured?SIAM helps standardize processes and tools which enable a single window of service for Business User. The business user thus feels empowered to manage his resources and issues in an effective manner which in turn improves overall satisfaction for the Services being delivered. While the business user experiences ease of use, IT gets enabled to maintain better control of such services and keep things secured by their ability to enforce standards and policies. There are no wasted hours or lost budget dollars.SIAM, thus helps put in place an environment which is flexible, controlled and provides a complete view of the services under provision. It helps achieve seamless provisioning of services from best in class suppliers with a clear view of the service level agreements and value derived from such services.Learn more by visiting the SIAM website.", Sudhendu Chaturvedi  ,Cloud , 7.9.2021
Time to modernize to cloud,/en/blog/2021/09/modernizing-to-cloud/,Cloud / Christopher Arsene de Jesus Wiborg / 3.9.2021,"Picture a hiker standing on top of a massive cliff looking at the other side. She sees where she wants to go, but what’s the best way to get there? She could put together a makeshift bridge, take the long way round, maybe paraglide over? The real challenge is assessing which of her options is the best. In the scenario where she’s an expert bridge builder, we must consider the potential opportunity cost of pursuing this option over another.Perhaps paragliding is a quicker and more cost-efficient option, but we still need the tools, the expertise, and the right circumstances. Therein lies the root of the cloud technology challenge; technical knowledge to understand the task and outcome, and a strategic mindset to evaluate the best course of action.Where technical knowledge meets strategic mindsetJust like bridge engineers, cloud computing engineers go through extensive training and formation. There is a reason why the IT industry experiences scarcity in these profiles; a lot of their knowledge and competence is only gained through actual fieldwork which gives a disadvantage to recruitment.Cloud technology changes and evolves so rapidly that new features are launched and decommissioned in the blink of an eye, which makes it hard for even skilled cloud engineers to keep up. One could also argue that it all may seem quite simple in cloud marketing videos and showcases, but truth be told, cloud computing can get very complex and not everyone is predisposed to pursue the technical prowess needed to meet the challenge. Even yours truly admits to being quite green.It is no surprise that there is a significant shortage of these experts compared to general market needs, which means that they are often swamped with work with little time to get familiar with new emerging features, cloud technologies, as well as the task of passing off their knowledge. So far, we have only identified the challenge on the technical side, but the strategic aspects remain. How does one come about measuring the economic and strategic pros and cons of a cloud transformation project?The real benefits of cloud computingIf you break it down to its core, the simple truth is that it is almost always cheaper to buy a single physical server instead of renting that same server in a public cloud; depending on the size, your break-even point can even be reached within the first year. However, this calculation does not take into consideration the real benefits that most often are hard to quantify.These strategic elements can include the need for redundancy, backup, disaster recovery, cost of maintenance, patching, and monitoring, or evaluating the effort to replace hardware and IT infrastructure when the time comes.If that wasn’t enough, these are only infrastructure points of interest; we have not even scratched the surface of the potential modernizations possibilities that lie in the middleware, the software and applications, data management, and coding principles. The real pot of gold at the end of the proverbial rainbow lies in these potential gains. However, they require a heavier investment in the allocated time, expertise, and resources.The organizational structure that is necessary to take full advantage of modern cloud computing is an equally important talking point, for what would be the point of having innovation at your fingertips if your organization is not structured to act on it. The ability to be agile towards market changes for instance, also means that the organization must be flexible enough to shift workforce focus for an adequate response.Simply put, the things to consider are many, the matter is complex, the outcomes are numerous, and the consequences vary greatly. How do we fix this?The answer is not necessarily simple, but it is logical. Basically, you have an idea of what you want to accomplish, and you want to define the steps necessary to bring this idea to life; The Black Box of (Cloud) Innovation enters the ring.The Black Box of (cloud) InnovationThe Black Box of innovation is a well-known concept in academic work of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, as made known by for instance Philippe Aghion and Jean Tirole, building on Schumpeter’s work on Research and Development. In short, the concept describes that innovation is an irregular and non-linear process where the factors that lead to successful innovation differ from one project to another. All though we are not dealing with inventions, there are parallels that can be drawn between these two scenarios.Almost all cloud transformation comes with a version of the notorious black box of innovation. Sure enough, there are many tools and published best practices to technically migrate and transform one’s services into a cloud computing model, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it will lead to a resounding success.There are aspects that hold a certain degree of uncertainty. The more significant the transformation is, the bigger the box. And because large boxes can be intimidating, we tend to lean towards simpler transformations that often result in little change; at the risk of oversimplifying things, if you’re running some apps on a server in your basement and decide to run the same apps in a public cloud datacenter, you’re really just swapping basements.Open the box! Naturally, the first step towards fixing this is by opening and demystifying the box and there’s no better way of doing it than just reaching in and dragging out its content. It’s quite difficult to completely identify all its elements, but by removing as many unknowns as possible the outcomes can become clear enough to validate if the path is the right one, or an alternative should be considered. Let’s look at how this is done.Step no. 3 of cloud transformation: ReadinessIn a recent webinar: “Clear skies ahead - How to accelerate your cloud transformation”, we reviewed the three main steps of cloud transformation: Opening the cloud innovation box is done during the Readiness phase. This phase is a whole chapter of its own, but in essence, you want to make sure that your idea resonates with your vision and strategy.Figure out the “why?” If for instance, your only goal is to gain more storage capacity at the cheapest price possible to address your growth of data, then cloud storage could be an option, but classic tape libraries will still give you the cheapest storage money can buy.Getting all the facts on the table, measuring the probable gains and the cost estimates will tell you if you can achieve what you were after in the first place.Figure out the “how?” How will you do it, what will it cost, and what will it take? This often starts with the need for the right competence to decipher this whole process, but identifying the right tools to use, and accessing the right information is important as well. Do you have the right people and competence? Is there established precedence for the transformation you’re going for that can give you reliable information regarding expected outcomes? Laying out the technical and strategic outcomes you’re trying to achieve for the sake of meeting your overall strategy is crucial to success.Figure out the “who?” The people factor has several important roles in this process.Firstly, the right competence will be able to properly understand and know how to act on the components of the black box. This will enable the ability to design cloud solutions, build strategies, calculate cost estimates, and evaluate the actual outcomes of the project. This aspect is quite crucial as this may also identify modernization paths that would not have been known to lesser skilled individuals.Secondly, it is recommended that skilled and experienced project teams are engaged to implement the transformation project. Costs are often an important factor to consider in these projects, and without a structured and controlled approach, not only could these costs skyrocket, but the implementation itself could be riddled with errors.A final and yet important point to keep in mind is to facilitate the process internally. This means freeing up the time for application owners, IT staff, strategic and economic personnel. Equally, this means creating a budget for competence improvement such as technical and strategic certifications, and if necessary, acquiring additional staff or consultants if necessary.If you can bring with you a single take-away from this blog post, is to always have a plan. With a good plan, the black box of cloud innovation can turn transparent and help you reach your goals.We at TietoEVRY can help you make the right choices, and transition seamlessly to the Cloud.Book a Cloud Discovery & Assessment with us here.", Christopher Arsene de Jesus Wiborg ,Cloud , 3.9.2021
The race to digital: why banks must rationalise their card platforms,/en/blog/2021/08/the-race-to-digital-why-banks-must-rationalise-their-card-platforms/,Digitalization / Hans Sjölund / 25.8.2021,"In our new white paper, we argue that retail banking is undergoing one of the greatest changes seen in its 800-year history. The shift to digital banking, including biometric security, faster payments and mobile commerce, has led to a huge rise in customer expectations when it comes to outstanding service and the instant delivery of innovative, digital-first services.At the same time, leading sources such as the UK’s Financial Times report that the profitability of card programmes is declining as issuers grapple with complex legacy technologies and rising costs in several areas. Despite the rise in digital wallets and account-to-account payments, cards are going to continue to play a central role in payments – and issuers should be taking decisive steps to ensure their card platforms are fit for tomorrow’s competitive environment.Survival of the fittestBanks need to revisit the way they manage their card programmes not just to reduce cost, but also to improve efficiency, deliver a better customer experience and ensure they can adapt to increasing regulatory burdens our industry will face as it attempts to tackle recent massive rises in fraud – particularly online.Given the huge numbers of cards out there, it’s no surprise there’s a plethora of different card management software platforms, each serving different systems, business units or geographies. Leaving aside the improvements in terms of costs and efficiency when rationalising card platforms, the presence of too many card platforms increases operational risk as each requires individual attention to maintain regulatory compliance and interoperability. The risk of system failure also grows as these platforms become older and more vulnerable.By rationalising their card platforms, banks can reduce the cost of issuing cards and control fluctuations in revenue from card issuing as all activity passes through one platform. They can also cut costs associated with maintaining regulatory compliance across multiple platforms and introducing new technologies such as mobile devices. Products are delivered to market more rapidly, compliance is simplified and the up-front investment in developing a new card platform is reduced.While almost all banks now recognise the need to digitise, to date this has taken far too long and has been undertaken piecemeal. Rationalising card platforms makes sense as part of the wider change to banking delivered in a fully digital environment; what’s more, it helps free up capital and resources for innovation in other areas. As banks rush headlong to “go digital”, they should not ignore the fundamental changes needed in their existing business.Our new white paper shows that the optimal means of rationalising card platforms is to embed a proven solution modified to suit a bank’s individual needs using Software as a Service (SaaS) as the delivery model. By taking the SaaS option, banks can improve their speed to market and adapt rapidly to changing regulatory demands.A piecemeal approach to digitisation is not a winning strategy for retail banks currently facing significant competitive threats. The new wave of “digital-only” banks are predicted to treble in size by 2030: given such intense competition, banks should not be spending time laboriously updating legacy card platforms and worrying about compliance requirements. These tasks can and should be left to a trusted third-party partner, leaving the bank free to create and deliver innovative products that enhance their customers’ experience and improve loyalty.To download a copy of “The race to digital: why banks must rationalise card platforms”, click HERE.", Hans Sjölund ,Digitalization , 25.8.2021
What’s in it for me? The implications of Central Bank Digital Currencies for everyday users and banks,/en/blog/2021/08/the-implications-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-for-everyday-users-and-banks/,Digitalization / Kim  Engman / 25.8.2021,"In the second of a two-part series, Kim Engman looks at the progress of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) including the different designs for CBDCs and how they might look; why they may impact most parts of the economy; and why consumers, business and banks would and should care.Read Part One: Bye-Bye Cash. Why Central Banks are Pushing Digital CurrenciesInspired by so-called cryptocurrencies and stable coins, and building on the development of open banking, instant- and mobile payments and private alternatives to money, central banks are looking to create Cash 2.0. This has the potential to be a lot more than just a means of paying for goods and services, it could change money forever.Most central banks are advancing CBDCsCentral banks, representing close to 90% of the world’s GDP, are either researching, piloting, or developing a CBDC. In fact, the Bahamas have already launched theirs – the so-called Sand Dollar.And the central banks of the three major currencies of the world (US Dollar, Euro and China’s Renminbi) are actively pursuing a CBDC.China seems poised for a 2022 launch coinciding with the Beijing Winter Olympics (live pilots are ongoing with millions of users), the US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has deemed a digital Dollar a high priority project, and the European Central Bank has just started a two-year digital Euro project paving the way for a possible 2025 launch.In our own neighborhood, for the past few years the central banks of Norway and Sweden, Norges Bank and Riksbanken respectively, have been publishing thoughtful and detailed reports contemplating the societal- and financial considerations including high-level design choices of a CBDC.This year, Norges Bank will embark on a two-year pilot project and the Swedish Riksbank has since 2019 been carrying out an e-krona pilot which we, at TietoEVRY are actively taking part in. Denmark’s central bank is officially averse to the idea of a CBDC at the time of writing.Cash 2.0 – smart moneyBeing digital, CBDCs inherently have the potential to be much more than just a means of payment.Central banks, by way of the design of a digital currency, have the option to both consider how CBDCs are funneled into the economy, as well as their traits and features.Depending on the design choices, commercial banks, consumers, businesses, and the economy may be greatly affected. Key questions need to be addressed such as: should a CBDC be interest bearing? How are virtual “bank runs” mitigated? And what will be the impact on Monetary Policy?Unlike today’s cash which is distributed via licensed banks, central banks could also choose to distribute CBDCs by way of new intermediaries - or even straight to the public.They could also choose to make CBDCs programmable and limit individual CBDC usage to specific situations, type of goods and services, online/physical stores, domestic/international purchases, purchase size, etc.Additionally, choices must be made on how to balance anonymity and privacy. For instance, whether it should be possible to track CBDCs with different thresholds of privacy/anonymity dependent on transaction amount (like the People’s Bank of China is considering).Equally importantly, central banks need to consider if they will require all users of CBDCs to have an account with the central bank, or whether they wish to emulate today’s banknotes and coins where users can share cash between themselves with little oversight. It is a choice between an account based or value (token) based CBDC.The future of commercial banksGiven the many CBDC design options open to central banks, commercial banks must be proactive and engaged. I have noticed a change in attitude amongst banks and banking associations from hesitancy, a few years ago, to a much more inquisitive attitude today.Due to the systematic nature of commercial banks, the central banks are also keen to listen to the financial sector. CBDCs will undoubtedly be a partnership between central banks, governments, the financial sector as well as consumers and businesses.What about users?Speaking of consumers and businesses, interestingly CBDCs are being driven by central banks, and not demanded by consumers or businesses.Even though CBDCs would be a claim on the central bank, and thus guaranteed, users would not see an upgrade from the digital “money” they have today.If one were to ask the average consumer, most would say that the money in their bank accounts is already digital, and perfectly easy and secure to use by way of cards or mobile phones.Central banks will need to motivate and explain a CBDC to the general public, and likely need to ensure CBDC usage, by way of both push- and pull-effects. For example: CBDCs could maybe be “pushed” into the economy, by governments mandating public payments and/or payouts for businesses and consumers alike. And perhaps a “pull” effect could be if businesses were to prefer instant, and maybe cheaper, payments in CBDCs and push by requiring CBDC payments of their suppliers as well as customers.Did you miss Part One?Check out Part One of this two-part series where I explain why central banks are pushing digital currencies.TietoEVRY and Central Bank Digital CurrenciesSweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, has been conducting a CBDC pilot since 2019 with the aim of “investigating whether it is possible to issue a digital complement to cash, a so-called e-krona” and with the objective to “Learn more about how a technical solution for the e-krona could work”.TietoEVRY is proud to be part of this e-krona pilot, focusing on how to include commercial banks’ infrastructure and role. We are convinced that CBDCs will be an integral part of the future financial- and payments landscape.

What can the payments world do to cut emissions?,/en/blog/2021/08/what-can-the-payments-world-do-to-cut-emissions/,Digitalization / Tomasz Pawlowicz / 19.8.2021,"Payment business is, by definition, digital.For simplicity of this blog, let’s assume that digital translates to less emission. In reality - digitisation represents the highest potential for the emission reduction, but it does not deliver anything automatically.From its very beginning the payments business relies on electronic connections between the payer and the payee. As in many other industries, we have had a less digital limitation, often called “last mile” and it relates to the way the payer identifies him or herself and therefore, how the payment is initiated. Historically plastic cards with the payer information on it, had either a magnetic stripe, or a chip. It is also clear we already have the technology to address this “last mile”. But that’s not all we can do. Here is a list of directions I propose:1. A card needn’t be physicalAlmost all new ways of payment do not require payer to identify him/herself with anything physical other than a mobile device. Today the data, including personal data, is easily migrated to a smartphone. We see rapid growth of tokenization and wallets such as Apple Pay, Google Pay or other ways of payment, that are fully based on the smartphones’ ability to keep data and wireless transfers secure. We, as an industry, have a responsibility to provoke consumers to opt towards such methods where plastic card is only optional, not necessary. The major initiative in this field is to replace card delivery by ability to tokenize it in a wallet. Let me rephrase it as this is important detail: replace, not give an option to tokenize the card that has been delivered. Once a card has been produced – the emission benefit is lost.2. Card can be more eco friendlyExperts say that one plastic card production is an equivalent of 20 g of CO2 emission. We can reduce it by 75-80% by producing the card from alternative materials. If card production is necessary, we should invest in minimizing harm it makes to the environment. All major producers and all major personalization centers are ready to provide such a possibility.3.  Why not share information about carbon footprint of the purchase?I can only agree to the wide-spread idea that the biggest potential benefit coming from electronic payments is information. Building sustainable business is a chance to materialize such benefit. Payment method, card, wallet, application, aggregates all our payments. Moreover, it can aggregate information on what we buy. From this point we are only one step away from information on what carbon footprint we generated by our purchases. There are functionalities that can translate our list of transactions into carbon footprint. Moreover, a great best practice is to give the consumer a chance to compensate his or her footprint financially.4. Payment Service Provider as a responsible companyEach entity, engaged in a method of payment, should also calculate its’ carbon own footprint. It requires collecting information on carbon footprint from all its vendors, cooperants and engage in a constant pressure on reduction. This topic, however, is a separate, long story that requires dedicated focus and exceeds the scope of this blog.5. Making all the internal processes paperlessCompanies, with PSPs as no exception, should continue investments to migrate processes to paperless and allowing customers to fully interact with the PSP in a digital way and automating internal processes. As this also includes convincing as many customers as possible to utilize digital channels it easily becomes most expensive point in the list.In summary there is a list of initiatives that payment industry should undertake, if it wants to build a sustainable business. The major powers are digitization and information - these are the foundation of the industries prosperity. Let’s use them for a good cause.", Tomasz Pawlowicz ,Digitalization , 19.8.2021
Bye-bye cash. Why central banks are pushing digital currencies,/en/blog/2021/08/why-central-banks-are-pushing-digital-currencies/,Digitalization / Kim  Engman / 19.8.2021,"Money, as we know it, is in transition. Banknotes and coins are no longer accepted by many merchants; digital money crosses platforms and newly created private currencies have emerged.Central banks around the world have not been standing idly by, while a plethora of alternative money forms are moving into the currency space.Increasingly, they commit to exploring and pursuing the opportunities that a digital, interlinked, and networked society affords them, even where money production is concerned.The cashless societyThe transition of money can be best witnessed in the Nordic countries, which are moving rapidly towards a ""cashless"" society – hastened by a large uptake of person-to-person mobile apps such as Danish MobilePay, Swedish Swish and Norwegian Vipps, and in-store payments via Apple Pay and various Android wallets. Norway leads the region, indeed all of Europe, with a mere 3% of retail payments being cash-based.The cash countdownCopenhagen Business School and Sweden's KTH Royal Institute of Technology estimate in a research paper commissioned by The Swedish Retail and Wholesale Council, that by 2025-2027, cash will no longer be in wide use. The paper even sets a date by when cash will no longer be feasible for merchants as a means of payment: March 24, 2023!Reliance on the private sector escalatesWith open banking, instant payment solutions and alternative means of payments popping up, the complexity for lawmakers as well as central- and commercial banks, businesses and consumers is increasing.Add to this mix, private and (mostly) unregulated digital “money” such as Bitcoin and Ethereum often labeled “cryptocurrencies”, and stable coins like Facebook’s Diem, and it is easy to see how complexities quickly escalate.As cash usage decreases, the reliance on the stability of commercial banks combined with a solid system of regulation, is imperative within the financial sector and the various payment rails built on top of this e.g., Visa, Mastercard, and domestic cards.Noteworthy, is that upwards of 97% of money is actually “produced” by commercial banks (by extending loans and credits to consumers and businesses) making the banks “systemic” in a societal context.However, even with the most stringent regulations and legislation in place, commercially generated money sitting in bank accounts, and their concurrent worth, will never be 100% guaranteed for account holders. Only cash comes with that guarantee as it’s a direct claim on a central bank. Case in point: within the Eurozone, deposits over EUR 100.000 will be lost, should a commercial bank default.The road to Cash 2.0So why do central banks want digital currencies?Well, commonly, central banks are required to ensure financial stability, stable prices, and safe and efficient payments, i.e., supply cash and regulate wholesale and retail digital payments.And with an increased reliance on the private sector for payments and money production, central banks are increasing their efforts to come up with an alternative to cash and perhaps re-establish their role in the money production and -payments eco-system and create something other than just money as a means of payment, but a digital version of cash that may include value-added features – or Cash 2.0.Coined by Bank of England in 2016, this new form of money is called CBDCs – or Central Bank Digital Currencies.In a 2020 discussion paper, the Bank of England also listed what seems to be seven primary reasons that central banks are pursuing CBDCs. Diminishing cash usage being one of seven.TietoEVRY and Central Bank Digital CurrenciesSweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, has been conducting a CBDC pilot since 2019 with the aim of “investigating whether it is possible to issue a digital complement to cash, a so-called e-krona” and with the objective to “Learn more about how a technical solution for the e-krona could work”.TietoEVRY is proud to be part of this e-krona pilot, focusing on how to include commercial banks’ infrastructure and role.

Data lakes and warehouses part 1: Intro to paradigms,/en/blog/2021/08/data-lakes-and-warehouses-intro-to-paradigms/,Data / Timo Aho / 18.8.2021,"Cloud environments offer many kinds of benefits like scalability, availability, and reliability. In addition, cloud providers have plenty of native components to build on. There is also a wide selection of third-party tools, some specifically designed for clouds, available via cloud marketplaces.Tools naturally tend to emphasize their own role in the analytics ensemble. This is often confusing when you are trying to select the best toolset. In this post, we go through general guidelines on the strengths and weaknesses of many of the tools.This is the first post of a three-part series where we evaluate differences in the basic approaches, or paradigms, of data warehouse and data lake based solutions.Blog seriesData lakes and warehouses part 1: Intro to paradigmsData lakes and warehouses part 2: Databricks and SnowflakeData lakes and warehouses part 3: Azure Synapse point of viewData lakes and warehouses part 4: ChallengesTwo paradigms: Data lakes vs. data warehousesBased on some major component choices, cloud analytics solutions can be divided into two categories: data lakes and data warehouses. Simply put, data warehouse solutions are traditionally centralized while data lake solutions are decentralized to the core. Both approaches have their strengths and are often used for slightly different purposes. Nowadays, it is common that products have features typical of both the categories. Even then, products still exhibit their original category and its point of view.Let us call this basic category approach a paradigm. Understanding the basic philosophies of paradigms helps in understanding the big picture. In this post, we dig deeper into the characteristics and differences of the paradigms. We start by dividing the analytics platforms to typical component stages. After this, we discuss ways to select the components from both paradigm points of view. In the next posts of the series, we will discuss how the paradigm can be seen in some popular products.Building blocks of an analytics platformData analytics platforms are usually divided into multiple stages based on the part of the process they cover. A typical batch data pipeline platform is shown in the figure above. However, the article analysis is also applicable to real-time platforms. The tools can be categorized from either processing (pictured in green) or storage (blue) perspective. The tool lines below correspond to their usability in different stages of the platform. For example, a typical data lake solution consists of separate processing and storage tools. In case of data warehouses, a single solution usually takes care of both the processing and the storage functionalities. Let us clarify the picture a bit more. From a processing (green) perspective, the data platform stages are:Ingest – Data is read from source systems using, say, API interfaces or ELT/ETL tools
Prepare – The data will undergo preliminary cleansing and checks
Transform & Enrich – Data is enriched and modified according to the use case
Serve – The prepared data is served to a selection of tools for actual usage
Visualize & Report – Information is provided to the end user in a form of a visualization or a reportMoreover, the current trend of the big data world is to store data in multiple layers according to the level of processing applied. The layers of data storage (blue) usually include at least:Raw (also called bronze) – Unprocessed source data that is stored as such
Refined (silver) – Quality verified data that may have undergone preliminary cleaning and standardization. The data is usually not yet pruned.
Published (gold) – Processed, combined and enriched data. Often, data has also been aggregated and pruned for specific use cases.The exact cover of data storage layers varies from source to source, but details are irrelevant here. However, it is important to note that, especially in silver and gold layers, data can be stored more than once. For example, gold layers typically offer multiple versions of the data for different use scenarios.Read also: The Fundamentals of Cloud Data PlatformsComparing data analytics platformsTraditionally, data analytics platforms were solutions for company reporting purposes. For this use case, data warehouses based on relational databases were the de-facto standard. However, data warehouses were not very suitable for processing new kinds of data, often called big data. The problem was due to data volumes, real-time requirements and type diversity which included unstructured and semi-structured data. To complement the toolset, data lake type solutions were developed during the last decade or so. According to a very broad definition in Wikipedia, data lake is a solution where data can be stored in its original form. In general, this means potentially infinite storage capacity for any file format. In practice, the term also covers the tools for processing the stored data. There is a tendency in the market to showcase a product as a “holistic data lake solution.” Usually they are right: in theory, even a virtual machine with a large hard drive would enable a capable coder to create a data lake solution. Naturally, this kind of a minimalist definition is not very useful. Instead, it makes more sense to consider the differences of the paradigms: basic principles of data warehouse and data lake based solutions.Data warehouse: Cleaned data offered in an organized structureFor the data warehouse paradigm, the basic approach is to offer a centralized product that enables data to be stored in an organized hierarchical structure, usually in the form of database tables. This solution includes such things as foreign key references between tables, granular data encryption and detailed user access management. Access to the data is primarily handled through a specific data warehouse product and typically using SQL language. The advantage of a data warehouse paradigm is the ability to define what data and format are provided to a user. In general, data is offered in a processed and clean format. This way we can guarantee the validity of the data, for instance. In addition, changes in source systems and data can be hidden from a user, at least to some extent. On the other hand, as a limitation we have a reliance on a single product vendor. For example, retrieving data from a data warehouse solution is only possible in ways supported by the product. Moreover, we need to pay, in one way or another, for retrieval of the data. The data warehouse solution may also become a resource bottleneck for data processing. Recently, there has been significant progress in solving the latter limitation.Data lake: Freedom through decentralizationThe core principle of the data lake paradigm is decentralization of responsibility. With a huge ensemble of tools, anyone, within the limits of access management, can use data in any data layer: bronze, silver, and gold. It is possible to organize data and table relationships, but the usage is usually not forced, and we can easily bypass them. A major advantage of a data lake solution is decentralization of both computation and processing tools. A data scientist can work on Python image analysis on their own machine with bronze layer data, a data engineer can modify silver layer data using Apache Spark, and an analyst may utilize gold layer data with a reporting tool. SQL language is typically available as one of the possibilities. Moreover, computation is decentralized and there are virtually no bottlenecks. A major weakness of a data lake paradigm solution is the lack of data organization, including a centralized metadata repository. It may be extremely difficult to track if processed data changes due to error corrections or source system modifications. Moreover, the validity or structure of data cannot always be guaranteed. Centralized data lake metadata management tools are increasingly available, but it is up to development processes to take them into use. Technology rarely forces this.Read also: A glossary will help you get up to speed on the world of dataConclusions: Data lakes and data warehousesIn this post, we went through differences in the basic approaches, or paradigms, of data warehouse and data lake based solutions. Data warehouse based solutions are typically centralized while data lake solutions are decentralized to the core. However, tools in both the categories are developing and the division is becoming less and less clear. Yet, understanding the paradigm approach helps in understanding the big picture. In principle, you can build a cloud data analytics platform purely on either a data lake or a data warehouse based solution. I have seen fully functional platforms that are based heavily on data lake tools. In these cases, information may be served with use case specific database data marts without a data warehouse at all. On the other hand, there are successful solutions where the entire platform is built on top of a data warehouse product. The data is read directly into the data warehouse, where it is processed and served. However, because of the differences explained here, a solution based on one of the paradigms is not necessarily optimal in all cases. Their strengths and basic philosophies are different. It may make sense to take advantage of a data lake based approach in the early stages when working on bronze and silver level data. The data can then be stored in a data warehouse for further organizing into silver and gold data. This way all data is available in both raw format for rapid experimentation, but also in structural format for reporting. That way, we can draw from the strengths of both the approaches.", Timo Aho ,Data , 18.8.2021
Awarded Android Automotive contributions boost the development of audio and vehicle data management,/en/blog/2021/08/awarded-android-automotive-contributions-boost-the-development-of-audio-and-vehicle-data-management/,Digitalization / Stefan  Wysocki / 13.8.2021,"Modern cars are packed with hardware and software. The challenge for automotive vendors is how to make them all work together reliably. GENIVI Alliance and its member companies are seeking for efficient solutions for Automotive OEMs. We met up with Piotr Krawczyk and Stefan Wysocki, who were both awarded as the Most Valuable Contributors to the Android Automotive development area by The Connected Vehicle Systems Alliance - COVESA (former GENIVI Alliance*). Piotr and Stefan contributed to two Android Automotive Proof of Concepts (PoCs) in the area of audio and vehicle data management.Audio management in Android AutomotivePiotr, you chose to work on Audio Multi-inputs/outputs Management on Operating System Level. Why did you select this topic?Every automotive manufacturer who would like to onboard Android Automotive for in-vehicle-infotainment will have to connect audio to their platform. Audio is very time-sensitive, and all integrations need to function smoothly for a good end-user experience.At first glance, audio might look simple, but it becomes more and more complex when you get into details such as routing, processing and control. Android Automotive is part of the ecosystem, and it is very important to enable reliable and efficient integration with existing solutions such as amplifiers, Digital Signal Processor (DSP), Echo Cancellation Noise Reduction (ECNR), and microphone array.Turning this complexity into a simplified solution is what drives me in my work.How does this PoC help to solve Android Automotive audio integration challenges?It proves that Android can be deployed in a completely HW independent way, and it can be plugged into existing platform audio subsystems. This enables a strategy where audio is mixed on two levels: 1. Android Automotive software 2. Automotive platform This should help system architects design systems that allow Android to seamlessly cooperate with existing solutions, and also be easily upgraded or virtualised. It should also help efficiently splitting the responsibility for handling audio between Android Automotive and the car platform.We came up with Audio HAL specific feasibility studies and guidelines, as well as proven outcomes on:Connecting external amplifiers with Android Automotive
Deploying Audio Video Bridging (AVB) protocol stack to Human Machine Interface (HMI) system when using Android Automotive
Optimal usage of Digital Signal Processor (DSP) resources
Integrating Android Automotive Audio routing into car infotainment systems
Using audio routing in virtualised environmentsVehicle API in Android AutomotiveStefan, you led the Proof of Concept track to develop a Vehicle Data Management Solution to unify access to vehicle data from Android Automotive. What benefits does this work bring to OEMs?All OEMs will greatly benefit from the standardisation of vehicle data access, as it will enable for example decreased maintenance costs of platforms and software.Together with OEM representatives, we evaluated different options to standardise access to vehicle data from Android Automotive applications and services.We came up with an idea to reuse Vehicle Signal Specifications made in another Genivi project. Vehicle data access standardisation needs to happen on the top architecture level to cover multiple operating systems and solutions running in cars, not only Android Automotive.We came up with Vehicle HAL specific feasibility studies and guidelines, as well as proven outcomes on:Using more complex signal access than Google provides in Android Automotive
Concepting Android Automotive out of the box access control and alternative approaches when searching for suitable/tunable solution for OEMs
Enabling VSS data models (Vehicle Signal Specification) to Android apps and services
Defining translation between VSS data model and Google VHAL data model
Common Vehicle Interface Initiative (CVII) project integration in the context of data exchange between the car and cloud/external servicesWith COVESA we actively develop solutions that will help the whole automotive industry to cope with the challenges of Android Automotive integration. Easy integration to other systems allows OEMs and tier-1 vendors more freedom and innovation to come up with distinctive features for end-users.Our automotive software development team has developed an Android Automotive VHAL Toolkit that enables faster and more flexible integration with hardware platforms.Read how we deliver Android Automotive projects and launches to elevate in-car experiences.*) Piotr Krawczyk and Stefan Wysocki were rewarded as the Most Valuable Contributors to the Android Automotive area in the Genivi Alliance All Members Meeting in October 2020.", Stefan  Wysocki ,Digitalization , 13.8.2021
4 focus pillars of PSPs,/en/blog/2021/07/4-focus-pillars-of-psps/,/ Tomasz Pawlowicz / 21.7.2021,"Who still remembers cheques in retail sales or cards with just a magnetic stripe ever so easy to skim?Today customers expect cashless tools to pay, to worki nonstop and everywhere and at minimum to no cost at all. One can say: the bar is high.Payment Service Providers (PSPs) are bringing payments to the next level, often separating them from their historical or traditional locations: banks. As User Experience (UX) always prevails, PSPs are applying the newest technologies to provide never before seen UX solutions. Recent Visa and Mastercard news and updates show that customers increase electronic payment tools usage every year.I would risk a hypothesis that future of payments lies in answering questions in 4 areas: eCommerce, instant payments, cross-border and domestic vs international schemes. Let us go through them one by one:eCommerce – the importance of remote channels of sales has been growing steadily for many years. Pandemic, however, accelerated the growth becoming almost the only way of retail puchase. After realizing the simplicity of such purchases, we see it stays at “pandemic level” in many markets or even continues growing. Noteworthy to mention -  modern solutions do not use card rails to complete such transaction at all. Each PSP must be conscious about consequences of supporting one way of eCommerce payments over another.
Instant Payments – electronic payments started with batch processing having authorization initiated online. The world has now progressed and today customers expect their funds to move between accounts in real time. Central banks as well as PSPs around the globe, are investing their time, effort and resources in developing possibilities to build a system that is capable of moving funds instantly. We already see successful implementations in many markets, but we will see much more in coming years. PSPs must have its strategy regarding instant payments.
Cross border – Traditionally card issuers positioned currency conversions as a source of significant revenue. The competitive situation started changing together with success of FinTechs offering lower costs of the conversion. Today cross border electronic payment do not necessarily mean card transaction and the topic is much broader with aspects related to currency conversions, obviously, but also to speed of fund movement, UX used of wallet top-up and fraud prevention.
Domestic vs international schemes – we see more and more players in payments market in general. Two decades ago, we all believed market consolidation will only progress. FinTechs and the more adaptive retail banks are making payments even more convenient and cheaper. Many of them are domestic, at the market level, but we see they have started their journey towards becoming international. Previously domestic schemes are becoming more and more international building their ecosystem between the markets.What makes a strong PSP strategy even more complicated is the fact the areas I listed are interconnected. To illustrate it, it is enough to say cross-border is often eCommerce transaction paid with a domestic scheme with funds often moving instantly. PSPs and banks in particular, require support of experts who are able to combine all 4 domains in their recommendations. Moreover, modern systems servicing payments, take all those areas into account building competetive user experience. In order to stay relevant in the modern marketplace of payments, PSPs must wisely distribute investments between eCommerce, speed of funds movement, cross border and potential scheme used.Projects we are engaged in now are exactly touching all those points. It is indeed complex but satisfactory to build a puzzle that brings success.", Tomasz Pawlowicz ,, 21.7.2021
"Guest blog: Guess What? We Don’t Have a Clue About the Future of Pulp, Paper and Fibre",/en/blog/2021/07/guest-blog-guess-what-we-dont-have-a-clue-about-the-future-of-pulp-paper-and-fibre/,Digitalization / Alf  Rehn  / 14.7.2021,"The reason this doesn’t bother me all that much is the simple and irrefutable fact that I am well aware, and even certain, that not even the most knowledgeable person in the field really knows this future any better than I do. In fact, one could well argue that their knowledge means that they are far less certain to know it than I do. So, to make my point almost painfully obvious, I don’t know the future of the industry – but neither does anyone else!Safety of the safe future predictionAs Yogi Berra famously pointed out, it’s tricky to make predictions, especially about the future. Just about anyone can tell you that what is going on today might be going on tomorrow as well, and that whatever is exciting right now is likely to be interesting in the months to follow. The problem is that when you go beyond such simple statements and basic timeframes, futures tend to get a whole lot more complicated. Try to say anything very specific or challenging beyond the futures we all expect and can fit into our current timeframes, and you are more likely to be seen as a crank or crazy person than you are to be seen as a seer or somebody insightful. We like the safety of the safe future prediction, and the tales that do not surprise us much.The reason for this is simple, yet difficult to process. As humans, we tend to stick to what we know, and what makes sense to us. Anything that challenges this we’re likely to discount as noise or as frivolous, and the more we know, the stronger this likelihood will be. In fact, if you are an expert, you’re far more likely to discount a new idea or ignore a disruptive one than if you’re just averagely knowledgeable. This is what one might call “the knowledge trap” of futures thinking. The more you know, the more you’re likely to unconsciously protect your knowledge and your standing in the industry, and this quickly leads to not spotting truly impactful changes. The best people in the camera industry did not see the digital camera coming, and the smartest people in hospitality laughed at Airbnb. The interesting question is, what are the smartest people in pulp, paper and fibre ignoring right now?Stop thinking we know what the future will bringThe sad and tricky thing about futures thinking is that the people who were best equipped to get the company to where it is today may well be the least equipped to lead it to success in an uncertain future. We don’t like to acknowledge this, as the people who were best equipped to get us where we are today are often… us. What we all need to work on is to stop thinking we know what the future will bring. We need to get better at imagining strange, curious, taboo futures. We need to let go of our arrogance and realize that sometimes our knowledge and our expertise isn’t the solution – it’s the problem.I don’t know the future of pulp, paper and fibre, and it’s a wonderful feeling. It makes it easier for me to spot the strange new things, the odd occurrences, the unexpected. I may not know the future, but at least I’m walking into it with eyes wide open.", Alf  Rehn  ,Digitalization , 14.7.2021

AI/ML embedded in the order confirmation process could help. In future, the customer enters a raw material request using their own ERP and receives immediate feedback, including price. In case the request cannot be met, the response includes selectable alternatives. The confirmed order status can then be followed online.Many mills already use a set of automated checks for cost-effectiveness, efficiency, raw material availability and loading capacity. Despite all automation, delivery alternatives and price variations remain a stumbling block.Let’s say the customer wants 20 tonnes by Friday, but you can only deliver 15 tonnes. Alternatives include:15 tonnes as requested, with 5 tonnes a week later
The full amount delivered following Wednesday at reduced price
The full amount delivered from a different mill or combining mills, with tailored logistics increasing the price slightlyToday, finding these alternatives is manual work, involving several people along the supply chain, and resulting in a delay in getting back to the customer.Roll production – where to optimize furtherKey to improving overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and aiming for lower working capital is to avoid unnecessary length waste and overproduction. Embedded AI/ML can identify defect areas inside the jumbo reel and help recover quality defects with minimum losses.AI/ML-based soft sensors forecast important quality data, today only measured in the laboratory. In future, the role of the laboratory is to make control measurements to verify that online and virtual sensors are working as expected.Further down the line, virtual sensors and a prime production adviser make it possible to automate online trim adjustments to minimize quality-based waste and forecast online how much more is needed from the paper machine to complete customer orders.A promising new concept is dynamic centrelining. It identifies good runnability and then allows an AI/ML algorithm to find out which controls and value ranges provided the best results.Taking manual labour out of convertingFolio sheeting is a complex, yet common process, with plenty of possibilities to optimize. The process with folio sheeter, guillotine, sorting, reamer, and wrapping is always the same but depending on the business, has plenty of variability.Typically, sheeter machine production is pre-optimized for backstand usage and sheeter setup times, but quite often other machines are not. The reaming machine, in particular, can benefit from optimization. When two machines are optimized with different criteria, we also need buffer storage. Optimization that schedules both machines needs to take care of buffer storage to enable fast material movements while avoiding oversized buffer. As a result, continuous optimization is needed for the complete folio sheeting process.By optimizing the sheeter process and produced pallets through embedded AI/ML, manual sorting can be reduced and thus sheeting line efficiency increased.TietoEVRY’s TIPS industry solutions and services already are, or will in the next couple of years be, fully AI/ML enabled to cover most of these important optimization areas.", Antti Blomqvist  ,Data , 5.7.2021
Consumerization leading enterprises,/en/blog/2021/06/consumerization-leading-enterprises/,Cloud / Pete Nieminen / 30.6.2021,"Back then consumerization was mostly about intuitive user interfaces, mobility, easy access, and smart devices that could communicate with each other. The outcome was that companies started to focus on enabling a better Worklife (a solution concept for work-life balance) for their employees by providing them with better tools to do their work and more flexible ways of working. Consumerization was here to stay.After a couple of years, I turned my focus from Worklife to enterprise cloud and eventually to where I am now, combining SAP, cybersecurity, and public cloud. Consumerization hasn’t really been present in my work on heavy-duty enterprise business, resource management, and hyper-scale public cloud – until recently, we had a panel discussion about SAP on Public Cloud.Antti Kleemola (an experienced CIO/CDO and innovator), Jukka Antikainen (SAP on Azure lead on Microsoft), Antti Ryysy (Head of SAP Offering at TietoEVRY) and I found ourselves together on a panel talking about why the rest of the world has already moved a long way towards SAP on public cloud while the Nordic countries are just getting started. I had always put it down to our bad experiences as early adopters of outsourcing and cloud technologies. Even now, at a time when the cloud is more mature and an excellent platform for SAP, we are still hesitant to go all in.Antti Kleemola came up with a different and very interesting point of view. He suggested that most Nordic enterprises, and especially large Finnish ones, are from heavy manufacturing industries, which are not famous for their agility or close connections with end customers. In essence, this would mean enterprises that supply consumer services and products that rely on direct customer opinions, trends, and feedback would need to apply customer requirements more directly to their processes.What would be the most effective, agile way for SAP, invented in 1972, to apply customer requirements and expectations to enterprise processes? The answer comes from consumers and employees because the public cloud solutions were originally invented for them. To get the most from enterprise, you need to utilize the public cloud services and ecosystem to achieve real business flexibility and financial predictability.With over 20,000 enterprises utilizing the public cloud as their SAP platform and ecosystem, we can safely say that it is suitable for Nordic enterprises too. The question is not should you do it, but what is the best way to do it and what possibilities you should explore.Got interested? Read more: SAP on Public Cloud", Pete Nieminen ,Cloud , 30.6.2021
Time to put resilience at the core of business strategy,/en/blog/2021/06/time-to-put-resilience-at-the-core-of-business-strategy/,Digitalization / Thomas  Nordås / 23.6.2021,"I’m not only talking about pandemics, but also about climate change and geo-political power shifts. While the world has always been in a state of change, there was seemingly more stability than there is today. Now disruption is the status quo.The pace of change requires more resilience in business models too. Technology will continue to develop and change the behaviour of people, businesses, and our surroundings. Risk and profit are now more closely aligned , so you may need to trade some of your business performance for resilience. In other words, your focus may need to shift.Business models that are easy to adapt and adjust to different situations will be a winning formula. Such models will likely also have more scenarios included and need more frequent change and adjustments.People are your greatest asset, so making sure they know what to do and how to take action in different situations is key. The more complicated situation is, the simpler the plan should be.Businesses that are able to utilize and take advantage of data – as well as that have a strong focus on the four key factors listed below – will most likely emerge stronger in the years to come.“Work will never be ‘normal’ again… Employees are coming in with more expectations that the employer should support their core needs: Having more autonomy and more connection,” says Cristina Banks, Director of Interdisciplinary Center for Healthy Workplaces, the global research Centre at Berkley University of California.", Thomas  Nordås ,Digitalization , 23.6.2021
5 reasons why security should not be barrier to running SAP in the public cloud,/en/blog/2021/06/5-reasons-why-security-should-not-be-barrier-to-running-sap-in-the-public-cloud/,Cloud / Antti  Heinonen / 22.6.2021,"Security for business-critical applications is possible in the cloudThe role of security is to be a supporting and enabling entity in deployments, bringing trust and peace of mind. In this way, security demonstrates its vital role as a component of business continuity and risk management.By default, cloud vendors offer a plethora of tools to ensure resources are safe in the cloud, and these should be used in every cloud installation. But if you really want to have a truly secure environment you need to bring in some third-party tools too. Another important aspect is the automation of deployments – running everything with code minimizes the risk of human error.Well-designed and maintained security protects deploymentsWell-designed cloud security protects all data and applications for short and long-term deployments. All applications have their weak points from a security point of view. When the security around an application is well maintained, applications can be run for a long period without interruptions caused by security incidents or the urgent need to install a security patch. Virtual patching and vulnerability management ensure that the relevant parts of an application remain secure.Automated security measures save time and effortAutomation enabled by cloud deployments helps to meet the most important security requirements. Secure connectivity between the cloud and traditional data center environments can now be self-healing. Vulnerability management can be fully automated with continuous monitoring and reporting available for relevant parties. Application and API security can be automated using machine learning and artificial intelligence to eliminate boring and repetitive tasks and enable security professionals to concentrate on more urgent matters.Achieve a consistent level of security across your organizationThird-party security solutions have the domain expertise to enable better security in cloud environments. In practice, this ensures the same level of security across the organization using the same tools and technologies and without limitations. This is a key concept when digital trust is being created with high visibility and manageability.Reduce the risk of weakpointsCloud architecture differs from most on-premises solutions in that it has not been built incrementally over a long period; vendors invest heavily in hardware and all networks are implemented in such a way that everything can and should be monitored. On-premises solutions on the other hand are commonly a mix-and-match of old and new data-center technologies. This is a clarion call for hackers and provides them with several potential weaknesses to exploit. The cloud eliminates all of these challenges, minimizes the attack vector, and makes it easier to manage even large systems.Cloud security is not an easy task to tackle and should be handled by experts in the field. Some ""server huggers"" speak out against the cloud because they lack knowledge and are afraid of anything new. The first step is yours to take, and the benefits are there for the taking.

New payment infrastructures to improve utility payments with Request to Pay,/en/blog/2021/06/new-payment-infrastructures-to-improve-utility-payments-with-request-to-pay/,Digitalization / Sami  Uski / 21.6.2021,"Utility bills – a poor user experienceUtility bills are often paid manually. Bills are either sent directly to a customer from the utility company or a Creditor Service Provider (CSP) manages the process. Historically, utility bills have been difficult for customers to manage, as there is little or no standardization when it comes to managing personal preferences, such as changing the invoice delivery address, providing consent for e-invoices, or enabling automated payments.Furthermore, the user experience is extremely varied depending on the channel an invoice is received in, i.e., traditional paper invoice in the post, PDF to an email or e-invoice to a mobile wallet.For the sender and receiver of a utility bill, handling paper invoices is a costly and lengthy process. Entering data manually can easily lead to mistakes and tracking down missing payments from customers who have forgotten to pay bills is a slow and resource-heavy process. This is further slowed down by the fact that bills are batch-based, rather than being handled with real-time information flows. Furthermore, for utility companies that have operations in multiple countries, implementing country specific standards is always associated with extra costs – as is the case for banks.Smarter paymentsOne approach to solving many of the issues mentioned above is to utilize Request to Pay for utility payments. The real-time information flows associated with Request to Pay make it possible to communicate with customers and predict incoming payments. For instance, once a customer receives a Request to Pay to a wallet, they can instantly approve, reject or schedule a payment. That’s not all, a wallet provider can inform a utility company that an invoice has reached a user. Such information flows dramatically improve the predictability and forecasting of liquidity for utility companies.Request to Pay represents a crucial step in unlocking the full potential of instant payments. With instant payments, a customer can be notified if there are sufficient funds to cover payment in their account, and if not, a bank can offer financing options. In addition, the utility company could, for instance, promote special offers such as pay today and get a 5% discount as part of the payment request to a consumer.Learn more: Who benefits the most from Request-to-Pay?Learning from the NordicsLooking at payments in the Nordic countries offers an interesting insight. These four countries, which have so many synergies, have somewhat unique ways of managing utility payments. This in turn results in different user behavior.Finland has collaboratively managed the interoperability of e-invoicing. Banks have agreed to use the same e-invoicing standard and overall, have gained a major position on consumer invoices. Whereas in Sweden, at least at the time of writing, Bankgirot acts as a central entity where invoices are sent and then distributed. Denmark has had a long history with Direct Debits, leading to low penetration of e-invoicing. And Norway is now the leader on unified consent management and the ability to receive e-invoices to multiple channels – Vipps app, preferred mobile app or internet bank.When looking at the Nordics, the challenge ahead for P27 (the Nordic Payments Initiative) is to create one common e-invoicing service and a rulebook for the Nordics. The same applies for any other potential platform initiatives in this field. E-invoicing in the Nordics poses a challenge as each country has a different system, and commercial and operating mode, which does not support interoperability.At Tietoevry we have already created multi-channel distribution of invoices with unified visualization services to support Nordic system diversity. Our service clients’ customer scan receive invoices in their preferred channel, i.e., directly to their online bank, mobile wallet, or physical mailbox.Automated paymentsAs utility bills are a recurring payment for many people, automating them makes a lot of sense. Processes already exist for automating payments, including direct debit or standing orders. But some countries – such as Finland – stopped supporting Direct Debit when their current e-invoice services were introduced. However, e-invoice services do not support automating payment initiation in the way direct debit does, which has obviously had a big impact on utility companies’ bill payment conversion rate. The upshot of this is that some utility companies have basically returned to paper invoicing for many customers, as not all users have adopted e-invoicing.Based on these learnings, when implementing bill payment services in new payment infrastructures and real-time environments, it’s important to have designs in place that provide the mandate for direct debits from day one. Additionally, content rules should be in place, i.e., automated payments up to an agreed limit as set by the user. This way, utility payments could offer convenience and control to end-users and improve payment conversion of invoices via automation.The way forwardProblems persist for banks and utility companies. Country-specific standards need to be implemented, harmonization of invoicing is lacking, and little information is supported in payment flows. Many of these issues would be solved if individual markets adopted industry-wide standards. This would cut costs for banks and utility companies and enable interoperability as systems from different countries could communicate with each other.For example, the Nordic countries are regarded as e-invoice frontrunners, but time has taken its toll even on these infrastructures. Technology developed in the early days of the millennium will need to be modernized, and now, with ongoing globalization, collaboration among countries seems more important than ever.A great starting point for industry-wide standardization of utility payments would be a standard Request to Pay service. Each market could begin with a Request to Pay platform rollout, followed by, for example, an EBA Clearing R2P service on a SEPA Request to Pay (SRTP) scheme for Europe for further interoperability. When beginning to use Request to Pay, it should be simple to connect a proxy – social security, phone number – to iban and bic to ensure the ease of making payments. Markets should also be looking at implementing additional common services for utility payment use cases, like central biller registry, end-user mandates, and consent registry on top of request to pay flows.Ready to share our experienceHere at Tietoevry we have already implemented Request to Pay in our Nordic solutions for companies such as Siirto in Finland.

In search of low hanging fruit in customer lifecycle management,/en/blog/2021/06/in-search-of-low-hanging-fruit-in-customer-lifecycle-management/,Digitalization / Tomasz Pawlowicz / 21.6.2021,"Everything that is between these 2 events is called “lifecycle” of a product. Let’s look at credit card lifecycle as an example here:Figure: Illustration of credit card lifecycleWe can identify at least 4 major stages in credit card lifecycle: acquisition, usage build up, loyalty build up and retention. This is the most basic approach. Each stage can be divided into more detailed substages depending on the business need.The actual performance of each stage should be viewed performance specific at every stage as well as proportionally of the entire portfolio.Acquisition – the major metric we track here is Cost Per Acquisition (CPA). As this stage can be characterized by profitability going below zero, we advise that CPA is key to potential return in the future. Topics related to CPA is future performance of portfolio depending on the channel used to acquire cardholder. As general rule we recommend that pull channels result in better performing portfolio compared to push channels. However, we work with issuers to build technical possibility to track the performance. This is commonly aimed at creating a
Usage build up – as a rule of thumb we accept that this is first 6 months on books (MOBs) of the card. Each project we deliver takes different circumstances into account in order to select the period more precisely. Based on our experience, this is the most critical period when final behavior of the credit cardholder is established. With the data collected , already after first 6 MOBs we can, with high probability, identify customers who will be paying interests (“revolvers”) and those who will have a tendency to repay the card balance in full (“transactors”). On top of typical analysis, we advise you to put an emphasis on speed of activating customers compared to previous periods. Therefore, daily MIS tool should be a “vintage analysis”, which a special kind of cohort analysis limited to cards acquired in the same period, typically a month.
Loyalty build up – the core and in majority of cases the biggest chunk of the credit card portfolio. Usage is at the close to final level. There are no “low hanging fruits” that can radically change the portfolio performance by influencing cardholder’s behavior. We work with our clients at this stage to extend it as much as possible. We spend time here to do more detailed break down of the card users depending on their approach to proportion of balance repaid. On top of above-mentioned revolvers and transactors, we are identifying cardholders who mix different types of behavior e.g., occasional users who mix periods when they use the card with inactive, zero balance periods or customers in pay down who do not use their card neither at POS nor in ATM but hold a revolving balance, which they try to repay. This is also the perfect timing to installment product cross-sell, which should help in gaining additional revenue as well as lock cardholders with the issuer for longer time. In projects related to this part of portfolio, an installments strategy is considered a priority.
Retention – each cycle comes to an end. There is such time when customer proactively contacts us to close the product or at least we see that probability of card closure increases (how to see it is a separate topic called “proactive retention”). Our initial advise to clients is to know if the attrition is “regrettable” or “not-regrettable”. We know it requires automated scoring tools, which shares the immediate insight.The topic of lifecycle management is broad. In this short blog entry, I only touched a surface by indicating selected MIS components that may be helpful in your portfolio management and are key in our discussions on portfolio performance improvement projects.For more on our Payments consulting services please see here.", Tomasz Pawlowicz ,Digitalization , 21.6.2021
Our homes will be even smarter – thanks to the Matter standard,/en/blog/2021/06/Smart-home-systems-will-be-even-smarter-thanks-to-matter-standard/,Digitalization / Markku Tamski / 17.6.2021,"A few years ago, a friend of mine built himself a smart home alarm system. Combining different devices was a painstaking effort, and yet building his own system from ground up was the only possible way to get different types and makes of smart home devices to work together. Luckily, smart home technology consolidation has already started improving interoperability and will deliver consumers more positive experiences.CSA’s Matter standard is the next step in bringing the various types of smart home devices to a common ecosystem. The goal of the standard is to simplify development for manufacturers and increase compatibility for consumers. Smart home devices should be secure, reliable, and seamless to use. By building upon Internet Protocol (IP), Matter aims to enable communication across smart home devices, mobile apps, and cloud services and to define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification. Matter is driven by Amazon, Apple, Google, and the Connectivity Standards Alliance member companies.Matter is not yet another single vertical technology stack from the ground up, aiming to replace the current vertical stacks. It follows the internet paradigms and allows many different types of devices to communicate. Matter leverages common and widely supported technologies, instead of trying to be the optimal point solution for anything specific. For example, if the devices support IPv6 – regardless of whether they are Bluetooth, WLAN, or IEEE 802.15.4/Thread devices – they can support Matter in addition to any existing uses. It also defines common data and messaging models and vocabulary so the devices and applications can co-operate without separate translations.How has smart home technology consolidation evolved?The origin of smart home technology started from narrow single use end-to-end solutions, having lots of competing vendors for devices such as wireless thermometers, switches, and automatic curtains. These devices tended to be simple with minimal software. With these types of products, it is practically impossible to leverage the connectivity and interoperability of todays’ IoT, cloud and data-driven world. With the proliferation of in-house wireless connectivity, always available internet connectivity and a lifestyle built on smart devices, any smart home solution not leveraging them is immediately disqualified from the competition.Being successful in this connected environment brings its challenges, like security and the need to update the systems easily and often against any vulnerabilities and attacks. All of this requires software, so the traditional product model of connected devices - sensors, actuators, monitors, and controllers linking them – with minimal embedded software – is turning upside down. Software forms the core of the new model, and it then acts in the real world via many devices that may or may not be directly linked.Technology consolidation in smart home industry started with various technology stack specifications and frameworks. These solutions originate both from open industry forums such as the former Zigbee Alliance (now Connectivity Standards Alliance), and from companies licensing their proprietary solutions such as Z-Wave and Apple HomeKit. These vertical stacks most often started from a single radio and network technology and built the communication protocols and data models on top, with no regard to horizontal interoperability.As the marketplace decided which vertical stacks were able to build the critical mass of partners and products, attaining, for example, hardware radio chips for those stacks and devices became much easier. Radio chip makers and smart home product manufacturers had a common interface, and both could rely on there being multiple sellers and buyers for the chips.Industry has also started looking outside pure smart home specifications. Bluetooth has solidified its position as the primary solution for personal devices, just like WLAN has become practically the only home network wireless solution. Bluetooth has allowed smart home devices to work seamlessly – with no extra infrastructure needed – with applications in smart phones, tablets, and laptops. WLAN has done the same for cloud connectivity.There are now three main types of devices in the smart home:Traditional smart home networks with low power and long battery life connectivity (Zigbee, Z-Wave)
Bluetooth (e.g., temperature beacons) devices talking with personal devices
WLAN devices with always-available mains power talking with cloud services providing remote accessSmart home technology consolidation will benefit everyone - eventuallyOur ongoing work in The Connected Vehicle Systems Alliance (COVESA) for the automotive industry has taught us that a common technology stack is not enough for interoperability. Even if the devices all support IP protocols for communications, they are still not talking the same language. Using common protocols like IP gives us a common baseline across many different types of devices and physical networks. Something like HTTP then defines the various messages that can be sent.Data models are just as important for interoperability. A common understanding of the application-level data and commands are needed so that the different devices can work together.In the short term, as with all technology consolidation trends, there will be winners and losers. The companies that have invested in the other, incompatible vertical stacks that cannot utilise parts of their solutions separately for the new stacks will need to make a major decision. They need to decide whether they will keep investing in a technology stack that may divert from the more visible and more widely supported solutions. So far, in most if not all technology areas, consolidation has created a positive feedback loop once it has reached sufficient uptake in the marketplace. Smart home consolidation started small and slow, but right now it is entering the biggest, fastest period of unifying technology solutions and improving possibilities for interoperability between major ecosystems.The winners in the short term are the companies that can directly take into use and benefit from the market presence of the consolidated technologies. There’s now a clear view of the future development paths, with known technologies, tools, and products in place. Any devices using BT, WLAN and Zigbee can be used already today, and the adoption of the Matter standard will not render these uses obsolete.In the long term, this consolidation benefits everyone in the value chain, from chipmakers to end-users. Hardware and software suppliers as well as product development support companies can focus on gaining skills on fewer technologies and platforms with a bigger market and less risk. This leads to product vendors having options for tools, platforms, and other components, as well as suppliers to choose from. This is in line with our experience from the automotive industry’s AUTOSAR standardized software platform.End-users will reap the biggest benefits from this consolidation. This opens the door to interoperability and cooperation between separate ecosystems. Buying products to add to your smart home becomes easier and there will be more options as products transition from competing with technology stacks invisible to the end-user to competing with price, availability, features, and quality.If you are working with smart home solutions, plan your next actionsConsider these:When designing and building new products, work with those existing technologies that have a clear path forward. Be prepared to manage the needed transition.
Because software will inevitably get more complex, you need to plan your R&D to be software-driven, grow software talent and establish software development processes.
The role of the stacks diminishes but won’t disappear. They need to be in good shape and maintained, especially for security and privacy reasons. Badly functioning technology will still disqualify you.
Aim to provide the best features with the best user experience. As the role of the stacks diminishes, the competition will move to data and applications.
Take full use of the quality gates of the ecosystems, e.g., the Matter device certification process of CSA.
Focus on your gateway strategy. Gateway functions as the channel to both directions: gaining customer insights and offering digital services. Most likely your product portfolio will always require a gateway product, but you may benefit from working with other vendors as well.For companies that wish to shape the ecosystem and catch the first wave of the new smart home solutions, the time to act is now.Our experienced software engineers and architects help smart home device manufacturers to develop and maintain software for smart home products. We are an active member of the Connectivity Standards Alliance contributing to the compatibility of smart home technologies among IoT products and ecosystems.Read more about software development services for connected devices, products, and platforms.", Markku Tamski ,Digitalization , 17.6.2021
Time to make the risk of new product introduction well calculated,/en/blog/2021/06/time-to-make-the-risk-of-new-product-introduction-well-calculated/,Digitalization / Tomasz Pawlowicz / 16.6.2021,"In new product introduction, the major question we ask is if the new offering will resonate with the client needs. In majority of cases, we use common sense together with our experience from the industry to consciously assess if the new value proposition can be attractive. However, the “devil sits in details”. Although, we know general ideas that support the new product, it usually has number of parameters that decides about its future success or failure.Thanks to a high number of clients retail banking can apply research tools. We often start from qualitative such as focus groups, to shape the concept that then would be evaluated in quantitative research. The major reason for such an approach is the fact quantitative methodology, by definition, has relatively limited number of parameters that can be evaluated. Using a good qualitative approach in the beginning should limit the list of dimensions to a manageable number. It means we could do valuable validation at the quantitative stage.The situation, however, is different in corporate banking. Products are often more complex and are customized per client. Though this tailored approach gives wider possibility to address actual needs of the client and their customers, new product market introduction requires more from the product owner.One such example area, in which TietoEVRY gained wealth of experience, is Virtual Account Management (VAM). Although, the idea of consolidating big corporations’ financial flows is close to the heart of each CFO trying to manage it, there are we see institutions can set up different one from another. They can be all successful, as clients differ, markets give their limitations and regulatory and legislative requirements.Here, TietoEVRY Business Consulting does not leave its clients to fight the battle alone. We can analyze needs of a representative number of clients on individual interviews basis. This component then is a basis for so called “gap analysis”, which is a result of comparison between best cases coming from benchmarking, and, in this case, new product concepts. “Gaps” are differences, which we either consciously ignore or address. Another benefit is our wide experience in corporate banking product delivery, from which we source deep know how.An example of such collaboration could be one of TietoEVRY leading several initiatives providing Instant Payment Switch to central banks and entire markets. Access to the functionality provided by individual banks is a part of a customer value proposition and, as such, must answer to a number of principal questions including pricing, branding or UX.New product implementation is high-risk and high-cost initiative. I would like to recommend investing a small fraction of entire budget (often one digit) to cover a cost of not only the product implementation itself but also making the risk of the introduction well calculated.For more on our Payments consulting services please see here.", Tomasz Pawlowicz ,Digitalization , 16.6.2021
Superior Customer Experience is only Possible with Good Data: Time to Establish a Dedicated Customer Data Team?,/en/blog/2021/06/superior-customer-experience-is-only-possible-with-good-data/,Data / Matti Airas / 15.6.2021,"Most companies have put in place a marketing automation system and integrated it to their CRM. They’ve also designed and implemented a few automated customer journeys like newsletter subscription and lead generation. The next step, more complex data-triggered marketing programs, seems to be harder to take. The reason for this is the lack of good quality data.Besides not being able to run always-on marketing programs, less than good data causes many other problems: Predictive analytics scores (e.g., lead scoring, propensity to buy, churn risk) cannot be calculated accurately, and many functions cannot do their work properly because they don’t know the customer well enough.This is a shame because the other three building blocks of data-driven marketing are coming nicely together. Younger­­–more tech-savvy marketing professionals–are entering the workforce, tools are becoming more mature, and processes are improving with system thinking and built-in customer journey -tools.Graphic 1: The four building blocks of data-driven marketingEven with all these components in place, the marketing team still fails to implement more complex ways to communicate with leads and customers. Maybe the problem isn’t in the tools or processes or people. Maybe the problem is in the focus and specialization. Maybe it’s time to establish a dedicated Customer Data Team (CDT).A dedicated team needs a clear missionEstablishing a dedicated CDT is a substantial investment, and this means that the team’s mission must be crystal clear from the start. Below is a set of 7 core functions of the CDT team.1. Brainstorm use casesYour marketing team should design the always-on (data-triggered) marketing programs, but they might need some help to do so.The CDT can assist the marketing team by teaching them the principles of data-driven marketing and then facilitating a series of workshops to design the always-on marketing programs.2. Model the dataThere are two approaches to collecting customer data:extract sufficient data from your marketing, sales, support, and other relevant systems and then transform it for your purposes, or
define the data model that is required to execute your always-on marketing programs and collect only that specific data.Both approaches have benefits and risks.The former will give you a lot of data that you don’t need while excluding some data that you might need. In other words, some thought and effort are needed to make sure you’re exporting the right data. With the latter approach, you might miss out on data that you need in the future for a new, as-yet-unknown, use case. You can always ask for more data later, but your business information (BI) teams might not be too happy about creating new exports, and it could take a while until you get your hands on the additional data.I recommend starting with the latter approach – a “just-what-you-need” dataset.3. Collect the dataYou need to be able to collect all the needed customer data in your marketing dataset, which needs to be controlled by marketing and cannot be part of your organization’s common data lake or some other IT or BI-managed system. Centrally managed data depositories invariably fail to deliver what marketing needs.Customer data can be divided into three main types: identities, attributes, and events.A single customer can have many identities. For example, customer’s social media userid is different from their CRM customer number.
Attributes are more or less fixed customer characteristics like demographics (gender, age, profession, zip code) and firmographics (revenue, employee count, industry code, etc.). Attributes can be collected, for example once a day via batch file transfer.
Everything else is events. This includes anything from website visits, ad clicks, and social media likes to purchase transactions and survey responses. Events are collected as a continuous stream using close to real-time APIs such as REST.4. Complete the dataRegardless of which data collection strategy you choose, you need to get the job done. This means that at minimum the data fields required to run your always-on marketing campaigns need to be in the marketing dataset and the fields need to have values in them. Data fields are meaningless if they are empty.Machine learning can help here, but only if a small number of values are missing and if these values can be predicted by a machine learning model. If many data fields are missing, they need to be populated manually.In B2C business it is almost impossible to populate data fields manually, but in B2B salespeople should know their customers and be able to help fill in the gaps to some extent. B2B salespeople might know the right value off the top of their heads or have the data somewhere in their computer (for example, email address or title). Just remember that this is not their top priority. Sometimes the only way to make this happen is to link CRM data completeness with salespeople’s incentives.5. Stitch together identitiesIdentifying the same customer in different digital services is tricky because many services use different ways of defining the customer identity: anonymous web visitors can be identified by a cookie (if they allowed it), while mobile app users can be identified by the device ID or email (or even customer ID if they logged in).With social media things get murkier: in LinkedIn people are mostly themselves but their user ID might not match their real name and there might be many people with the same name. Twitter is even more difficult.Facebook isn’t usually a good source of customer data because it doesn’t allow the extraction of any data beyond what is on the company's own Facebook page. But, depending on your industry, you shouldn’t discount Facebook completely: you might find your biggest fans (and biggest detractors) there!All these different pieces need to be stitched together into one uniform customer ID.6. Enrich the dataEnriching your data is one of the best and most reliable ways to improve its quality.Firmographics data, such as company size, can be bought from a third party using a company’s tax ID or similar public identifier. Company names alone often aren’t enough because there can be many companies with similar names and a company can have several legal entities.Zipcode-based demographic data providers are a new business in Europe. This is a tricky attribute to rely on because there can be all kinds of housing and thus income levels within one zip code. Nonetheless, it makes for an interesting addition.Another, often neglected, method is to use visual analytics to increase your understanding of your customer base. This requires knowledge of data shaping and visualization methods, so your CDT should include people with the relevant competencies.If your data includes free-form text fields (for example, Net Promoter System text comments), it might make sense to categorize these comments by topic and sentiment. Doing so turns free-form text into statistical information that you can use to create targeted messages (e.g. discount offers to price-sensitive customers).7. Share your insightsOnce you get the quality of your data to an acceptable level, other teams will be more than happy to utilize the same data. You should make the customer dataset visible to other teams via BI systems and visualization solutions such as Power BI, Tableau, or Qlik.Which skills does my CDT need to have?In order to bring real value to the organization, your CDT should have at least two members.1. Customer data expertThe customer data expert’s mission is to cut through the corporate obstacles and make the other team member’s work as efficient as possible. Their mandate must be powerful enough to get any and every piece of data that is needed to execute the data-driven marketing programs.A customer data expert’s job is also to educate, brainstorm, and facilitate customer journey design and implementation. They should have a good understanding of data modelling and how to run predictive analytics projects.The customer data expert is also responsible for any compliance and data security issues (GDPR and privacy, industry-specific regulations, etc.).2. Customer data scientistA customer data scientist’s job is a mix of data shaping and advanced analytics skills.Usually, the APIs are set up by the IT department, but a data scientist might be needed to get this job done as well, and that’s why they also need to have ETL-skills (Extract, Transform, Load).Customer data scientist should be able to run a machine learning project using third-party APIs (Tensorflow, Sagemaker, etc.) or a tool like Rapidminer. For that they need to know Python.These experts are hard to find because they prefer to work with like-minded people, and the other member of the team may not fit the bill in this regard. Data scientists are also, at the moment and for the foreseeable future, in high demand and this type of marketing-related work might not interest them.One of the key things when setting up a CDT is to decide on the set of tools. This is important because the tools that you choose define the required skillset for your team. In my view the most suitable tool to accomplish the core mission of the CDT is a customer data platform (CDP). More about that in my next blog post.If you don’t fully understand your customers, you can’t predict their behavior and target the right message at the right time via the right channel. While a dedicated CDT is a substantial investment, choosing not to invest in a CDT might turn out to be much more costly to your business in the long run.", Matti Airas ,Data , 15.6.2021
Wealth trends 2021: Advent of the Underserved,/en/blog/2021/06/advent-of-the-underserved/,Digitalization / Sameer Datye / 14.6.2021,"Financial institutions have served the investor needs successfully in good as well as bad times. This success can be attributed to the fact that the stereotype image of the investor was easy to create, associate with and serve. However, this image is now being challenged - especially so in the past few years. A new breed of investors is making its presence felt- and that too with a bang.The article is the latest in the series exploring “Top 10 trends impacting Wealth Management in 2021”Three of the most prominent underserved segments are: women, millennials and the “covid investors”. These are the segments that seem to be growing and rising. They represent a market opportunity waiting to exploited but which has not been addressed adequately due to systemic and cultural bottlenecks.1. WomenAccording the BCG study (2020), women control 32% of the world’s wealth. From 2016 to 2019, women accumulated wealth at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1%. Over the next four years, that rate will accelerate to 7.2%. Women are adding $5 trillion to the wealth pool globally every year - faster than in past years. The current share of women’s wealth is the highest in North America. However, Women in Asia have the highest growth with a phenomenal 10.4% annually.Wealth managers will need to find a concrete way to address the blooming yet underserved segment with its own peculiar investment needs:Trust is paramount: Most women prefer referrals from people they trust when choosing a bank or wealth manager. Trust for them is more important than pure numerical comparisons like management fees, investment performance, taxes, costs etc. A robotic comparison on digital platforms will not suffice.
Family & Friends: Investment advice from family & friends is the preferred source and not wealth managers. This is probably the manifestation of the “trusted source” need as mentioned earlier. Could social investing tools be the answer?
Personalisation: Relationship managers need to connect on personal level to understand the aspirations. There is a tilt towards marketing campaigns that featured people like themselves and that discussed challenges similar to those that they face.
Long term, not short term: Female investment behaviour is different than from their male counterparts and is beautifully encapsulated in the book Warren Buffett Invests like a Girl. Studies show that female investors tend to be patient, rather than impulsive; realistic, rather than overconfident; prudent, rather than reckless. They tend to think longer term, take much lesser risks, and just generally view investing more as a means to an end, (security for their families, for example).As the first step, the wealth advisory community could start by acknowledging that this is a specific target market group which must be handled differently. Retrofitting this group into traditional existing groups like ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNI), high net worth individuals (HNI), etc, simply won’t fly.2 The Covid investorsThe pandemic has brought to the fore a new class of retail investor – those who have wholeheartedly entered the wealth markets for various reasons.Time availability: This may sound strange, however, the sheer amount of time available for multitasking because of remote office, movement restrictions, social distancing, meant more free time for many. Time was spent exploring and learning about stock market action.
Alternative sources of income: With traditional business badly hit by the frequent lock downs and general downturn in economic activity, many now see the stock markets as an alternate source of income.
Weak returns from other investment options: Negative and near zero interest rates mean stock markets are now the only option to earn some returns.
More awareness and easier entry: Trading platforms, online education forums, social investing tools, very low trading charges, have lowered the entry barrier and increased the capacity through knowledge building.Now it remains to be seen that whether these newbies will metamorphose themselves to be long term wealth generators. Undoubtedly, they have now tasted blood and it is an opportunity for wealth managers to open wide, a new market which will sustain even after the pandemic has passed.3. The Millennials & the post millennials (Gen Z)The millennials and the post millennials make up for the last big, underserved segment. They hold around 10% of global wealth increasing at an outstanding 16% per annum. The following are some of this segment’s characteristics.No inhibitions about technology whatsoever and they are supremely digitally savvy.
Social media presence, existing relationships, gamification, hybrid advisory, social investing are top expectations.
Prone to invest in new instruments like crypto currencies.
Extremely price savvy in terms of management fees, investment returns, taxation etc.
Need complete transparency – in transaction views, reporting, and execution.
Compare online with competition and are not afraid to shift frequently.
Socially aware and and willing to invest in sustainable financial instruments.
Brave and willing to take some risks with invulnerability syndrome not completely lost after teenage years 😊.Wealth managers (all - large Financial Institutions, boutique and wealth managers, digital-only advisors) need to meet these highly volatile young investors on their own turf. Understanding their tacit motivations and catering to the resultant needs will be the key to success. The trick will be figure out how to create a relationship that is digitally driven, allows self-service and at the same time the advisory value is explicitly visible for the users.The advent of the underserved is challenging for sure. Nevertheless it is a harbinger of new market opportunities for financial institutions. The pandemic created a push for the common person to investigate capital markets as an option and thus came about the Covid investors. Maybe, more than diversity trainings, simply having more women advisors might get better results with women investors. Efforts invested in building a hybrid strategy to marry technology innovation with personal touch for advisory will help connect with the millennials & the gen z.TietoEVRY has been making pioneering efforts to catch latest trends. WealthMapper is a modular digital toolkit that utilises the latest developments in technology and distribution to speed up innovation and time-to-market. This empowers financial institutions to create meaningful conversations with their customer and offer self-service tools to their customers.

Building an inclusive culture needs everyone on board,/en/blog/2021/06/building_an_inclusive_culture_needs_everyone_on_board/,Sustainability / Trond Vinje / 14.6.2021,"However, this message isn’t loud and clear everywhere. Regardless of the United Nations declaration of human rights, LGBTQAI+ people and minorities, people with rainbow identities, people from various social and ethnical backgrounds and beliefs face prejudice and discrimination every day. Pride promotes their dignity, equal rights, self-affirmation and is a way of increasing society’s awareness of these issues.For companies, supporting Pride is a visible way to take a stance on the matter and join in on the work. We at TietoEVRY are proud to partner with Pride - in Oslo, Stockholm and in Helsinki, read more here. It is a small gesture but is carries a greater symbolic value – inside the company as well as outside. To truly build diversity and inclusion as key strengths of the company culture, requires work from all of us - every single day.Working for diversity and inclusion every dayAt TietoEVRY, we see inclusion and diversity strongly dependent on one another. There can be no equal opportunities if difference is not valued, harnessed and taken account of. By doing so, we create an environment, where people don’t need to waste energy and creativity on hiding who they are or feeling ashamed, but instead we want to create opportunities for everyone to flourish and grow. An inclusive company culture enables everyone to be true to oneself - to be the best version of you also at work environment. This is what we strive for – see our recent employee testimonials here to learn more.Our Diversity & Inclusion charter outlines our ambitions on the area. We have a concrete target for gender balance, but we also want to see a good blend of different age groups and nationalities in various functions reflecting our global reach. Our ethical guideline, the Code of Conduct, is our beacon of light, stating clearly the company’s stand points to human rights and respect for every individual - and having a zero tolerance for any discrimination.Diversity enables innovationIn our business we are solving our customers’ challenges every day. Diversity enables innovation – and innovation is what we live on in this highly dynamic technology sector.Diverse teams enable creating best user experiences for the diverse users of digital services and solutions.Pride month highlights differences, equality, diversity and human rights with celebration and serious talks. I am personally extremely proud that we as a company continue stand up for what is right. We support and welcome our LGBTQAI+ colleagues and are proud to celebrate with you during this month and every day.", Trond Vinje ,Sustainability , 14.6.2021
A truly inclusive working culture is not created with hashtags but with conscious choices,/en/blog/2020/09/a-truly-inclusive-working-culture-is-not-created-with-hashtags-but-with-conscious-choices/,Sustainability / Hanna Vuorikoski / 14.6.2021,"Somewhere in the world this week a company will have kicked off its new social media campaign promoting gender equality and diversity – and in all probability, there is a catchy hashtag to go with it. While raising awareness through social media is a must, the under-representation of diversity in tech development is a real problem that requires real commitments. Just using a hashtag to promote diversity is not enough.Diversity is not just about fairness; it’s also about ensuring that companies are bringing in the talent they need to thrive.  According to a report by the Technology Industries of Finland, over the next three years, the Finnish tech industry will need to recruit another 53,000 tech workers skilled in fields such as data analytics and artificial intelligence. To avoid a shortage in key positions, we must widen the talent pool. As employers, we simply cannot afford to miss out on all that brainpower.Read also: Building an inclusive culture needs everyone on boardResearch shows that diverse teams with a wealth of perspectives create better products and services, achieving at a higher level than homogenous teams. Bias in product design can harm technology development, for example, such as when the first speech-recognition devices did not recognize women’s voices. Diversity increases innovation, as people with different backgrounds and experiences naturally approach solutions from different perspectives. Inclusion also drives personal engagement and career success by allowing individuals to feel appreciated for who they are. An inclusive environment boosts individual self-confidence too.Clearly we should foster increased diversity in the tech industry. So how can we attract a more diverse workforce into tech and inspire people to succeed?Tech needs everyoneIn my view, we can and should encourage technology as a career opportunity for everyone – regardless of their background or preferences. The stereotype of a coder with an engineering background is too narrow. We also need professionals with business and humanitarian backgrounds, and of course we should not consider candidates on the basis of gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation.Attracting and retaining talent means offering employees an environment where they can prosper as their true selves. Through speaking openly and standing with pride, we can walk the talk to support this important cause.Within TietoEVRY, we have adopted a set of practices to foster diversity and inclusion. Our established programs – such as ‘Leadership as a service’ and ‘TeamWorks’ – are aimed at developing diverse teams and ensuring an ethical workplace culture. For example, our network of young professionals gets acquainted with various role models in the organisation. We also collaborate with different partners to increase digital equality, such as the ‘Startup Refugees’ work we do in Finland to improve asylum-seekers’ digital skills.Tackling unconscious biasUnconscious bias is an important concept for us to address as part of our efforts to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Biases are influenced by our environments and by our experiences, so they can be difficult to eliminate. One way to minimize their effects is to be aware of the biases one may have or may encounter. To this end, almost 900 of our managers have undergone TietoEVRY’s bias training, and we offer training on this topic for all our employees in Finland and Sweden.As leaders and recruiters, we must also tackle unconscious bias in hiring and promotions, so that each employment decision TietoEVRY makes is based on competence and potential. We monitor pay grades closely to ensure equal pay for equal work, and we offer benefits, flexibility and coaching to support each individual’s wellbeing through various life situations. We have also created models for developing diverse teams.Our recent initiative, the Polite Type, stands against cyberbullying and hate speech online. It is an open-source font that recognizes hate speech. We welcome everyone to test it and take this initiative forward. Join the movement via this link!TietoEVRY’s values of openness, trust and diversity are interwoven with our everyday work and interactions. Fostering an open, diverse and inclusive culture requires concrete, honest actions and leading by example. Even small changes can lead to big results.We partner proudly with the Pride organisations in the Nordics. Read more here, and join the events here!", Hanna Vuorikoski ,Sustainability , 14.6.2021
National payment systems are paving the way for real-time e-commerce and in-store transactions,/en/blog/2021/06/national-payment-systems-are-paving-the-way-for-real-time-e-commerce-and-in-store-transactions/,Digitalization / Micaela Vernmark / 11.6.2021,"In-store transactions have historically been dominated by cards. However, this payment method was not designed for remote eCommerce transactions. Entering card details for eCommerce purchases is a lengthy and manual task for consumers that not always gives an optimal user experience. This issue is compounded by the fact that the longer a checkout process takes, the higher the risk that a consumer will cancel their purchase.Goodbye to plastic?Providing a great customer experience is therefore essential for merchants to attract customers and close more sales. Nowadays, mobile wallets have significantly improved the payment process. They eliminate the need to re-enter personal details when making a purchase and can be used for both eCommerce and in-store purchases.Mobile wallets are usually either linked to a card or connected to account-to-account payment rails. But the downside of wallets based on cards rails is that they are usually heavily dependent on one of the existing large card schemes.Introducing domestic card schemes (essentially, physical cards) might no longer the best option moving forward, as there is a clear move towards digital means of payment. Therefore, when introducing new national payment rails, we need to rethink strategies. Is introducing new plastic cards the right way to go or is better to go for instant payment rails that are already digital at its core? This is an equally valid consideration in markets where card networks are not strong.Successful implementationsIn Europe, we are already seeing success stories from new providers that offer instant payments for eCommerce transactions. In Poland, the BLIK mobile app handles over 45 million transactions a month, of which about 35 million are e-commerce – a 200% increase from 2019. Instant transfer via phone using P2P is also growing fast. In the Netherlands, the eCommerce platform IDEAL, uses a single SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) backed by a real-time payment transfer guarantee to deliver a seamless service. 80% of these payments are authorized using a mobile banking app.Dual systemsStill, card payments remain extremely popular in many markets. As the two are often connected, the rise of mobile wallets has not diminished the use of card payments. Providing the consumer with the option of using their preferred payment method is therefore imperative and initiatives combining cards with instant payments, such as EPI (European Payments Initiative) show how existing payment rails can be combined with new ones to cater for consumers’ needs.Overall, apart from it being more convenient to reuse an existing POS system, a complete infrastructure upgrade isn’t viable as it would require huge investments for all participants – banks, merchants and technology providers.Read also: Do you have what it takes to be and EPI front-runner?Time to actThe main question is: How can we move ahead and build real-time payment rails that cater to both merchants and consumers?With ongoing globalization, the domestic payment method should be available and usable by consumers no matter where they are located. To allow consumers to use their mobile wallets when, for example, travelling internationally, interoperability is a must.Card schemes, such as Mastercard and Visa, provide us with some useful learnings. Their solutions – e.g., Masterpass and Visa Checkout – were different from one another, so merchants had to implement different solutions to cater for them, leading to extra work and costs.However, standards have now been introduced and systems such as EMV 3DS version 2 and EMV Secure Remote Commerce (Click-to-Pay) have replaced the different checkout experiences. This shows the move of eliminating the need for implementation of multiple solutions and rather going for common standards.In addition, the foundation for the necessary openness and flexibility of payment schemes has been laid in the ISO 20022 standard, which enables a rich data exchange. National infrastructure can also leverage APIs to enable market participants to offer interactive solutions such as using loyalty bonuses or providing credit offers at purchase, among other things.Finally…When introducing new national payment rails that cater for merchants, consumers and other market participants, it’s essential to consider:Whether existing payment rails should be integrated with new ones (as with EPI) or if new rails should be built independently.
Which standards should be used to build the system to ensure interoperability and growth over time.
How rails can be designed to enable market participants to easily build new services.Here at Tietoevry we have analyzed the key factors that make payment infrastructure implementations succesfull. Building a new payment scheme is a complicated task with many considerations and we are ready to help avoid pitfalls and share benchmarks from instant payments schemes from around the world.Feel free to reach out and let’s develop strategic plans based on your needs and market. We can provide you with all the necessary resources, support and technology to launch new payment rails.Learn more about Instant Payments Infrastructure", Micaela Vernmark ,Digitalization , 11.6.2021
Does your cybersecurity stack cover both risk and perceived risk?,/en/blog/2021/06/does-your-cybersecurity-stack-cover-both-risk-and-perceived-risk/,Cybersecurity insights / Maria Nordgren / 10.6.2021,"An often repeated mantra is that cybersecurity is not about technology alone. Cybersecurity covers the entire chain of people, tech, processes, culture, mindsets and anything else that can impact security.There is an aspect that we security people perhaps do not take into account often enough: perceived security. In practice, this means the feeling a person has about whether their system is secure or not. This does not necessarily have anything to do with a cybersecurity setup or the capabilities of an organization. It has to do with perception.When considering one’s security stack and setup, it may be the best in the world – but if it does not create a feeling of security, it does not meet all requirements.Data security would be one area to be used as an example. What data about an individual is collected by the system? Where is one’s data stored and how is it protected? How is the information used? Can it be stolen? How is its validity secured? Here we enter the realms of encryption at rest or in transit, database security, and network security. There are a bunch more considerations in perceived security, but all of these, in my view, can be combined under one cybersecurity umbrella: proximity.Does proximity equal control?How does proximity, then, create a feeling of security? We tend to feel secure when we have everything relevant to security close at hand. We want to have our systems, tools and data close to us. Seeing them there at the ready, seeing them work – this is when we feel most secure.This trend towards proximity is evident to cybersecurity experts when discussing security outsourcing and cloud-based solutions. We have noted with interest that purchasing decision makers expect proximity from the solutions they want to buy. At the extreme, this tends to translate into on-prem solutions: proprietary data centres, software, and support teams working in their native language. In other words, a minimal service (outsourced) component – and no cloud.While the above makes sense from a perceived security point of view, its practicality in the modern digitalization scheme makes less sense from a technology, process, expert availability or budgeting point of view.Even if one had the potential (read, money) to build and maintain all that is needed to have top notch constantly evolving cybersecurity, could one find the experts to do the work? Or develop all the tech one needs? Or keep growing that data centre?Control is about matching your risk and risk acceptance with your solutionsIt all comes down to defining your risks and risk-acceptance level, then allocating your budget across these to balance your risk elements and acceptance.It’s quite clear that in cybersecurity nowadays, one can rarely go it alone. One knows rationally that in the modern world, it is not fully possible to do everything in house – even if that would bring a feeling of 100% security. Some elements need to be kept in house, some can be acquired and used as services, including from the cloud. It’s the risk mapping and tolerance that determine the split.At the end of the day, this is a question of retaining overall control. The full security profile is one’s own responsibility. This is how perceived security is attained, i.e. having the feeling of control. It is possible to attain control with different combinations of on prem and outsourced cybersecurity solutions, which together compose the whole cybersecurity stack.Do you feel in control of your cybersecurity? We are happy to help with risk assessments and more to determine the appropriate security setup for your organisation and the industry in which you operate.Please visit our Advisory and consultancy pages to find out more.", Maria Nordgren ,Cybersecurity insights , 10.6.2021

Digitalization in packaging industries,/en/blog/2021/06/digitalization-in-packaging-industries/,Digitalization / Stefan  Kurz  / 9.6.2021,"• How is a packaging plant organized and how should it be organized?• What is currently shaping the industry?• What are the expected challenges in the future?The answer to the first question is not easy, but obvious: business processes must be analysed in sales, customer service, manufacturing and logistics. IT suppliers must take care that such existing or new processes will be adapted to existing software modules or vice versa, and that the software is able to support existing and future business process requirements. The analysis and definition of business processes can be regarded as mandatory homework. We can dream about artificial intelligence and fully automated processes, but this process of self-awareness, technical and business harmonization is the basis for all aspects of growth and competitiveness.What are the driving forces in the industry?The second and third questions at first glance look like they are not digitalization questions at all. When looking at packaging industries, we find some core topics each packaging producer has to deal with:Sustainability is a big consumer issue these days. For the manufacturer, it is no longer sufficient to produce nice-looking and functional packages. The packages should be 100% recyclable, sometimes compostable. This requires new processes, full traceability, and new raw materials. And of course, all this with the need to stay profitable and competitive while delivering safe and attractive packages. IT can only have a helping role here, but an important one: whereas the selection of raw materials is out of scope, the traceability and resource conservation of these raw materials, as well as energy-efficient processes, is a pure IT task.
Cost pressures abound, and the future winners will be the manufacturers who provide the best mix of quality, service, and price. Lean processes, the perfect mix of raw materials, competitive pricing and motivated people are the ingredients of that mix. Even though it doesn’t look like that at first glance, this topic is tightly connected to digitalization. A smooth raw material flow and speed on the shop floor, the right tools for customer service, and product development are key success factors.
Strategic business planning must respond to constantly changing consumer needs, whilst dealing with the ever-increasing speed of change. Such market changes drive mergers, company sales and acquisitions. Establishing processes and tools that allow predictable and easier company restructuring is and will be an increasingly crucial need in this dynamic business. Scalable IT systems and agile business applications are mandatory.Digitalization must support the whole value chainFinally, digitalization is not a value in itself. Excel lists sometimes have the flavour of being old-fashioned, but each of them must be checked against whether it makes sense to replace them by something else. On the other hand, it doesn’t make sense to invest in expensive and performing equipment if IT is not supporting its full potential. In other words, even the best, fastest and expensive printing machine cannot perform when the scheduling of the orders is not done properly, and the input materials are not available. Here digitalization is not ‘nice to have’, but indispensable.Learn more by visiting the TIPS for packaging website.", Stefan  Kurz  ,Digitalization , 9.6.2021
Why scale matters in the cloud,/en/blog/2021/06/why-scale-matters-in-the-cloud/,Cloud / Pete Nieminen / 8.6.2021,"In five years virtually every enterprise will be using the public cloud in one form or another and more than 80% will be using ERP in the cloud – most of them fully.More than 70% of cloud users are not satisfied with the cost savings offered by the cloud, while 67% are puzzled by the compliance and security challenges.Despite these challenges, more than 60% are planning to move more workload to the cloud, with the most common driver being cost optimization.There are many enterprises that simply do not understand the difference between the private and the public cloud. Today there’s all-in hybrid, private cloud in public cloud, and private clouds hosted in the public cloud. Sounds like a mess, right?In the Nordic region in particular it is difficult to understand what hyperscale really means. A datacenter of thousands or even tens of thousands of servers might sound big and capable, but it is tiny compared to the giants of the industry. If you have 50 locations on every continent, each of which is home to several datacenters containing hundreds of thousands of servers, that is hyperscale.So, why does scale matter?Removing the variable of scale totally changes the enterprise architecture and with it, the business model. Now we are talking about a real paradigm shift. We can forget about the traditional challenges regarding infrastructure, cost, and availability and start to concentrate on direct support for business. This is why 72% of enterprises now look to the cloud to help them become more agile.Who can I turn to for help and advice?Call the hyperscale vendors? Nope. They are just going to tell you that their solution is the best and why; they rarely tell you what their weaknesses are and you’ll hear a lot of “Yes, but…” excuses. You need to go very high in the organization and establish a high level of trust to hear the things you really need to hear.What about hiring your own people? Well, that might work for a while, but the teams need to be extremely well connected and willing to continuously develop, and there will be little time for anything other than simply keeping pace with the surrounding changes. It’s also very expensive.While this might sound very black and white, the fact is that getting accurate, useful information in the middle of the cloud boom is not that easy. One very good recruitment consultant told me that headhunting a high-quality cloud expert is virtually impossible – and not worth the effort since they would not stay for long anyway.So, network with a company you can trust, one whose business priorities and investments are not only focused on traditional computing or business models. Your chosen partner needs to earn their money – and your trust – by showing that they can give you good, actionable advice. The more trust you give, the more you gain.Trust does not just mean co-creation, it means taking risks, investing when uncertain, and being open to exploring new options. In this specific case, trust comes from the best practices and knowledge that your chosen partner has built and that your organization is willing to take on board.Finally, your chosen partner should be one with whom you share common goals, who says you need to take more than just one step towards the public cloud, and who tells you when to slow down, take a step back, and plan your strategy and journey before you jump to conclusions.Read more: SAP on Public Cloud", Pete Nieminen ,Cloud , 8.6.2021

It aims at seamlessly integrating interdependent services from various internal and external service providers into end-to-end services to meet business requirements.Myths and misconceptions about SIAM: “SIAM is only about vendor management” ; “SIAM is needed only where there are many external vendors” ; “SIAM would take care of solving all tickets for third parties”. “SIAM is only about ITIL process implementation in multi-vendor ecosystem”. “SIAM is service desk for multi-vendor ecosystem”.Positioning and adoption of SIAM:As Digitalization, Cloud and IOT Adoption growing, IT Outsourcing ecosystem becoming more complex. Financials are more dynamic, more specialized niche players are part of the ecosystem selling specialist products. Now with everything - as - a- service model business can buy services practically in weeks if not in days just by their corporate credit cards. procurement, Onboarding and Offboarding of a service has become faster. Due to this, demand for SIAM features like structured and standardized governance, control over finances has increased a lot. In this scenario we see this as a huge win – win opportunity to provide SIAM services in the market, SIAM seems to be an idea whose time has come.Here is an overview of the key strategic drivers for your organisation considering SIAM according to a Global SIAM Survey done in 2020 by Scopism.Key Customer BenefitsSimplified IT ecosystem and Supplier governance- structured service management and governance with business and IT suppliers. More control and better performance from suppliers.
Improved end user satisfaction through E2E ticket ownership– expect end-to-end resolution time to improve in 10-20% of tickets, and 10-15% reduction in tickets.
Ensured business continuity in Major Incident situations– Customer specific, 24/7 Leadership to take over the orchestration of all parties involved. Ownership of the follow-up to ensure that all is done to prevent the same to happen again.
Increased direct and indirect cost savings– expect 20-25 % savings to baseline in Service Management, and 10-20% improvement in ticket automation.
Focus on business growth– focus on development instead of re-starting your ICT personnel’s thinking process after each interruption from incidents.
Flexible resourcing with optimized competences– keep the strategic service management roles in-house, everything else can be sourced on-demand.TietoEVRY SIAM OfferingsIn TietoEVRY we are aligned with above definitions and built the SIAM Offerings accordingly.

What is changing compared to traditional IT service management?,/en/blog/2021/04/What-is-changing-compared-to-traditional-IT-service-management/,Cloud / Aki Kupiainen / 5.6.2021,"In our approach, ecosystem members and teams agree common Rules of the Club for themselves, commit to them, and continuously improve them together. This creates a cost-effective, scalable, and business value creating ecosystem where participants trust each other.What is changing compared to traditional IT service management?Introduction of self-directed teams that develop services close to the customer has had a huge impact on how ecosystems today are built and managed. Today, only the most specialized teams, if any, are operated by a single supplier. Team collaboration – especially when a team consists of participants from number of organisations - must be seamless, as everything is related to everything.The commonly used models SIAM, the structured way of managing and governing services, and DevOps, based on tribal culture, agile development, have coexisted for a while already. Many of the challenges today arise from the fact that although these both models impact on each other and partially overlap, they have been seen as separate, stand-alone entities.Inclusive Empowerment – this is how we call our approach - combines the best of SIAM and DevOps. While traditional service management focuses primarily on managing who does what, Inclusive Empowerment focuses on optimizing why and how the ecosystem as a whole works and what is done there. It transforms traditional, process-oriented service management into a management model that develops and maintains the entire ecosystem; with holistic view and by taking into account the continuously changing nature of the ecosystem.This approach ensures that through the whole ecosystem there is:smooth collaboration within and between teams (best of DevOps)
synergies from common practices such as contracts, communications and tools (best of SIAM)
transparency and business orientation of measurement and monitoring (best of SIAM)
automation of maintenance and development processes (best of DevOps)Want to learn more about the benefits of this new way of working, and how to get started?Download our SIAM + DevOps: from service provider management to empowering inclusive service ecosystems.Learn more by visiting the SIAM website.", Aki Kupiainen ,Cloud , 5.6.2021
Three ways to help your mid-market company grow,/en/blog/2021/06/three-ways-to-help-your-mid-market-company-grow/,Cloud / Thorbjorn Nielsen / 1.6.2021,"If you’re helping lead a mid-market company (or a smaller company hoping to become one), this data demonstrates not only the significant value your sector contributes to the global economy but the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead for continued growth.What will it take for your organization to reach its next level of success, whether that’s achieving financial goals, geographic expansion, or moving beyond the mid-market to join the big leagues?The answer lies within three critical areas:how efficiently your company operates
how quickly you can adapt to change
and how successfully you recruit and retain talent.Operational EfficiencyOne of the mid-market’s biggest growth challenges is complexity around administrative tasks and back-office functions, such as payroll and accounts payable.Often, the problem is not having the right systems in place (or any real systems at all, causing these companies to rely on manual processes). As a result, employees end up creating and developing processes that use spreadsheets and other applications across many disconnected systems, which introduces the risk of data inconsistencies and errors.BlaBlaCar, the world’s leading long-distance ridesharing service headquartered in Paris, was challenged by increasing complexity and administrative work as it expanded globally. Too much time was spent on manual, time-consuming processes such as extracting and reconciling data from multiple systems.Moving to a cloud-based financial application enabled BlaBlaCar to standardize financial processes and improve decision-making. As an innovative organization expanding rapidly into new markets, it needed a standard set of financial processes across many regions and the ability to add new entities quickly. BlaBlaCar now has a single source of financial data that key stakeholders can access in real-time, enabling them to make critical, in-the-moment decisions regarding the organization’s future.Elekta, a rapidly growing multinational company headquartered in Stockholm and a pioneer in the treatment of cancer and brain disorders, previously used a number of different HR systems that made simple tasks very challenging. “Even confirming the basics, such as how many employees we have, was difficult,” says Raymond L’homme, global HR business application manager.To support its growth plans, the company replaced more than 20 disparate systems with a single cloud-based human capital management system, which unified processes across the company. “The biggest advantage is one system, which is huge for our global managers,” says L’homme. “We have the same processes, the same look and feel. If we want to increase salaries, it’s the same process in China as it is in Sweden.”Adapting to changeIn today’s environment, you have to be aware and ready to respond to change, whether it’s identifying potential disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or competitive threats, complying with new regulations, or keeping up with evolving customer expectations.That requires you to adopt a mindset of continuous planning, so you can adjust as conditions change. Traditional planning approaches such as static annual budgets no longer make sense.Cloud-based planning systems—especially those that leverage data across operations in one system—have changed the game when it comes to data and analytics.Consolidating HR and finance into one system of truth allows companies to capture both the content and context of everyday business events to deliver financial, operational, and management reporting from the same set of data in real time. This significantly improves the quality of data and reporting and gives you better insights into your business for planning.It also provides a great advantage when it comes to planning and executing growth strategies. People are often a company’s biggest cost, and having real-time metrics such as headcount, costs, revenue, and cash flow can help you better understand performance, identify issues, and adjust and change when it matters.Recruiting and retaining talentDeveloping more formal talent planning and management processes may feel beyond many midsize companies reach. Many work with several obsolete applications across HR, talent, benefits, payroll, and recruiting, which takes considerable time and resources to manage and doesn’t provide the foundation and capabilities needed to support more effective talent management practices.However, advances in technology are now making it easier for midsize organizations to build out more sophisticated talent capabilities. Cloud-based systems that bring together human capital management, talent, recruiting, and learning in a single system enables companies to streamline these processes, reducing the amount of time spent working manually between systems.Having a single source of truth across these functions also provides greater visibility into overall costs and performance of people. As the organization grows and expands, you can answer questions such as: are my best people working on my most critical initiatives; where do I find the best talent; who are my retention risks; where are the gaps in the leadership pipeline; and what talent is contributing most to revenue?Unibail-Rodamco, Europe’s leading listed commercial property company, chose to transition its HR operations to the cloud to support its presence in 12 countries and drive future growth. “As we prepare for the future, it is important that we adopt an HR system that can support fast growth and change while also giving us deeper visibility into our workforce globally,” says Sylvain Montcouquiol, chief human resources officer at Unibail-Rodamco.The mid-market serves a great need in the world economy, fueling jobs, innovation, and growth. While this group faces unique challenges, advances in technology and evolving approaches to operational efficiency, planning, and talent will help your organization address them in new and better ways. The future is bright with greater support and tools to help you grow and build on your success.Are you interested to learn more about this topic? Good news!

4 steps considerations to payment digitalization,/en/blog/2021/06/4-steps-considerations-to-payment-digitalization/,Digitalization / Tomasz Pawlowicz / 1.6.2021,"As this is no question for startups, they make use of existing and the newest technologies available as is, however it is more difficult task to endeavor for the more traditional banking players. They call the process “digital transformation” which consumes most of investment money in recent years.The all known truth: without transforming to digital technologies, traditional banks lose their competitiveness. Customers will gradually choose the easier way of banking.User Experience (UX) is everythingThe importance of UX cannot be overestimated. Simple UX decides between success and failure of customer the facing application. As part of our business consulting projects, we approach UX in the most scientific way possible measuring customer interactions. Our conclusions are then converted into a set of mockup screens to confirm the insights and to build an ideal customer journey.Having said that, there is a decision to take by a traditional financial institution: the new technologies also simplify operating model almost in each activity area. We can use it for the benefit of more efficient customer acquisition e.g., migrating Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures to remote channels, or for the benefit of simpler, faster, cheaper new product development or future integrations by taking advantage of internal APIs. Such decisions are on any financial institutions daily agenda.Where the value of external advisory lays is in approaching a field of uncertain decisions in the field of digitisation with clear, fact-based priorities for investments.Digitalisation budgets tend to grow significantly. Decisions on its allocations are therefore of the highest importance to an organization. There are few high-level considerations I would give:Benchmarking is only a supportive tool – copying others’ steps may lead you to copying their mistakes. We have often seen when entire markets, majority of entities make wrong decisions because they were copying what others are doing. Moreover, each institution has its bottle neck somewhere else. Good identification of a point in your operating model is that, when improved, brings the highest return on investment.
Digitalisation is only a supportive process – it sounds like a controversial statement, but I have seen too many cases when new technologies application was a goal in itself. Try to avoid such mistakes. Think about benefit that is going to come rather than how are you going to do it.
Do not act under a time pressure – do not get me wrong, it is important to take decisions in timely manner. However, the worst scenario that may materialize when you skip current state and gap analysis stages and jump prematurely into implementation. It increases risk of suboptimal investment significantly.
Do not panic – a strange recommendation, I must admit. However, it helps in keeping discipline of logical thinking. Customers are loyal by nature. Attrition is never 100%. You will not lose them all tomorrow. Invest time and effort in proper preparations before money goes to a dedicated bucket. It refers to the previous point.These considerations are obviously not exhaustive. We have seen a lot of attempts to digitize processes that would not necessarily benefit a lot from a transformation. Our advice, however, is to think it over carefully. Take time. Invest in external consultants to guide you through the process of upgrades and leverage digital technologies available.

Up and sideways: responsibility and trust opened doors to many roles.,/en/blog/2021/05/responsibility-and-trust-opened-doors-to-many-roles/,Meet our people / Nina Kähönen / 31.5.2021,"These days, my priority is recruiting new colleagues and securing the best employee experience for our talents. Simply put, I ensure that we have operative smoothness in place, while we grow and our people feel well and valued.My career path has been varied – sometimes up, sometimes sideways, but always forward with positivity and curiosity to learn new things and challenge myself. I have had a diverse and versatile career, with the proper support to change paths along the way.Always focused on progress and overcoming challenges with positive energyI graduated in 1997 as a telecommunications technology engineer, but I have never actually written code professionally! I have been at Tietoevry since 2003 when the company acquired its mobile development team from Siemens. Just a few months later, I took on leading the R&D team in the Devices unit. In 2005, I was called in as Interface Manager to set up the operations for our new office in Ostrava, Czech Republic.After returning from maternity leave, I went to lead our operational and capability development including Process & Quality, Project portfolio management, and Competence development, to name a few areas. One of our biggest customers then was Nokia, which enabled us to rapidly grow from 80 to around 1,200 professionals. At the same time, we were setting up operations in new locations in India and China – while recruiting heavily! This hugely exciting time welded our team tightly together and kickstarted some of my lifetime friendships all around the world.In the early 2010s, I transitioned to Sales Director of our Telecom and Media unit, where new challenges were again waiting, I took on the unfamiliar situation of a dissatisfied customer with business growth issues. Driven by my sincerity and desire to make things work, I told the customer about our challenges and my goal to ensure their satisfaction with our cooperation, which established trust.Once again, 2014 was time to take new challenges and place customer experience at the centre of business, and having fun along the way. Customer Experience Management (CEM) unit was founded in the beginning of 2014 as an internal startup at Tietoevry. I was asked to join a new unit – with brand-new challenges ahead! Initially, I led around 100 mobile experts worldwide, and in 2016, web applications were added to my responsibilities. In this larger role, I aimed to change how we work, while increasing transparency and creating a sense of freedom, mutual respect, and creativity within the team. Since my passion was in people, I was able to start culture transformation where we aimed to show our potential and succeed with a culture in which everyone cares about our mission, is valued and helps each other. I was also tackling a familiar challenge: growth and finding new great colleagues. During 2021, we were able to recruit over 40 new people!Change means continuous developmentFor me, progress has not just meant moving vertically in the organization, but also moving horizontally by building new knowhow and capabilities. In addition to cultivating a broad skills toolkit, I have built an extensive network at Tietoevry.Some think all big corporations are bureaucratic and slow. But at Tietoevry, the large size means that you do not need to look outside for interesting opportunities and unfamiliar challenges. You can jump from being a developer to account management and sales. All of this and more is possible – and actively supported at Tietoevry. So, there is no excuse for getting bored here! What I can say is that we will never run out of possibilities and jokes in this work community.When Data & AI meet human touchI have recently joined the Data & AI service area in Tietoevry Transform. We are a global team of 450 experts and a dedicated partner for our customers in their data driven transformation. What makes us special in my mind is that we believe in a lean way of working, empowered global teams, happy talent, and growth both professionally and personally.Our hearts beat for the union of data, business and human touch – this is what gets us going.Taking care of our own, alwaysWe have a strong sense of community and belief in each other lifted, and we are paying extra attention to how we care for our team – with trust and enthusiasm.On a daily basis, I am amazed, inspired, and pushed forward by my amazing colleagues. I cherish our impactful work, vast competence, and strong relationships. And I get a kick out of helping people develop and advance, but especially in seeing them do great things!We are recruiting.

Building more equal and inclusive digital society with Findy,/en/blog/2021/05/building-more-equal-and-inclusive-digital-society-with-findy/,Data / Markus Hautala / 31.5.2021,"MyData principles set the direction for digital identitySeveral members of the Findy cooperative have been strong proponents of MyData movement since its inception and are also members of MyData Global. MyData Global is an international organization whose aim is to improve people's self-determination regarding their personal data as well as their ability to transfer data smoothly from one service provider to another. It strives for a fair and sustainable digital society where the sharing of personal information is based both on trust and a balanced and fair relationship between individuals and organizations. With that in mind it is quite logical that we have sought to develop practical solutions to empower both individuals and organizations to manage and control their identity data in a privacy-protecting way.Technology developments have paved the way for decentralized identity networksDue to their independence of any single actor, solutions building on decentralized technologies are increasingly being seen to carry significant potential for the personal data economy. With the help of these tools, we now have the means to establish new types of decentralized trust networks whilst avoiding vendor lock-in. Many members of Findy cooperative have been a Nordic pioneers and contributors within this domain since the TrustNet research program. Meanwhile, required technologies, the trust architecture as well as standards have been developed at a rapid pace. These now include several complementing open source projects, an Internet-scale digital trust architecture as well as various open standard initiatives. All this is well in line with our aim to advance the development of more equal and inclusive digital society.The Nordic model and technological maturity enable Finland to lead the chargeFinland is well-known for being a technologically advanced country and a leader in EU’s Digital Economy and Society Index rankings. This combined with the Nordic model and mindset, it is hardly a coincidence that a non-profit public-private digital identity initiative of this nature emerged especially from Finland. The Finnish worldview has a deeply engrained understanding of fair market economy, economic efficiency, social equality, and globalization. These are the very ideals that have guided the Findy consortium as well.Through founding of the Findy cooperative we are jointly contributing to the creation of ethically, economically, and socially sustainable data economy.With Findy, we aim to give individuals and organizations control over their own data, improve security and trust for all participants as well as promote competitiveness of Finnish and European data economies. In contrast with the currently prevalent platform business model, we believe that basic infrastructures required by the society should not be an area of competition. Instead, healthy competition should exist among market participants that use these infrastructures.We also believe that these infrastructures should be collaboratively governed by the private and public sectors so that all stakeholders’ interests are represented in a balanced manner.Collaboration is the key to succeed in global digital economyFounding of the cooperative is a result of many years of systematic and persistent effort, but also the beginning of a new phase. As Chairman of the Board, I naturally hope that Findy leads to financially sustainable activities for the members of the cooperative and thereby generates more wealth for Finland. In general, the only way to preserve the Nordic model and basic services required by the society is to ensure that tax revenues remain locally. Herein lies the root cause for our participation in the Findy cooperative.For our part, we want to avoid a situation where the Nordic countries end up as colonies in a global data economy where the value generated by data ends up being transferred abroad. The risk of such a scenario is very real as wealth creation in the digital economy is highly concentrated in the United States and China, with the rest of the world trailing considerably far behind.Furthermore, we do not believe that we can succeed in global competition alone, but we need to collaborate with equal-minded organizations to collectively succeed in the digital economy in the future. The founding of Findy cooperative is a major step towards this direction and we believe that this is just the beginning of an exciting and rewarding journey.Please contact me if your organization is also interested in joining the Findy Cooperative.The blog is originally published at Findy.fi/en.", Markus Hautala ,Data , 31.5.2021
Time to break down the silos for exponential P2P payments growth,/en/blog/2021/05/time-to-break-down-the-silos-for-exponential-p2p-payments-growth/,Digitalization / Edgars Bremze  / 31.5.2021,"The past few years have seen substantial growth in the peer-to-peer (P2P) payments market. Many of us already use a mobile app for banking, bill-splitting and sending money to relatives living overseas. At the same time, cross-border payments and remittances remain complicated. There is a clear requirement for speed, convenience, and affordability for digital payments – something that has been accelerated by the pandemic.The siloed approachP2P payment apps are typically linked to a credit or debit card, or a bank account. Most operate within a closed loop payment scheme and are not interoperable. This applies to banking payment apps providing P2P payments between bank customers as well as fintech/PSP based apps providing P2P payments between customers. They all essentially operate in silos and within national boundaries, resulting in a limited reach and poor service efficiency.Critical mass for successThe success of a particular payment service depends on a provider’s ability to attract a critical mass. For example in 2021 more than 73% of the Swedish population over 16 used Swish. The key success factors of Swish include: transfers are free of charge for users, and the brand is very well recognized in the country. Other examples include Alipay, the most widely used third-party online payment service provider in China, and Tenpay. Both are strong brands. Alipay has a 54% share and Tenpay 39% of the Chinese mobile-payments market by value.P2P leads to new service growthOnce instant payments are introduced by an actor, we begin to see extensions to the service being rolled out. For example, Swish has added consumer-to-business (C2B) transfers. Users can also pay merchants by scanning QR codes available at partner merchant stores with the Swish app.P2P can also be used as an additional value-added service to alternative platforms such as social media. Facebook, for instance, enabled card payments in the form of Facebook Pay. While in India, WhatsApp entered the market utilizing an existing instant payments provider’s unified payment interface.Card P2P paymentsP2P payments can be made with cards in selected markets, including Russia and Ukraine but this comes with higher commission rates. The payee typically makes a payment through a website but it can also be done through an ATM. In Russia, there are also P2P card payments, based on proxies and mobile numbers. Russia Mastercard, for instance, introduced a new service using phone numbers. The initiated transfer is sent to the Mastercard Payment HUB, where the payment system searches for the card number of the recipient. If it can’t find it, an SMS message is sent to the recipient to register their card for payment. Mastercard then makes a MoneySend Payment Transaction.The cost of RemittanceIn many developing countries remittance still plays a key role. These international transfers are done through various transaction channels provided by banks, nonbank financial institutions, and money transfer operators. However, the high costs associated with many operators are opening the door to fintechs, such as Wise and Joompay who are looking to lower the cost through cross-border and P2P payments. With that said, there is a commitment among the G20 to reduce transaction costs of migrant remittances to less than 3% by 2030. Finding the right balance between regulations and transfer-transparency will be key to this, as will the development of mobile payments and digital platforms.International P2P transfersThere is a clear need for interoperable P2P schemes that support fast, low-cost, cross-border payments, based on lower remittance fees. Many actors, such as PayPal, offer fast international payments but this is within closed loop systems. Imagine if Swish customers could make P2P transfers to VIPPS, Paypal or Alipay customers? If the silos of single schemes were broken, by regional and global interoperability, payment transfers would become cheaper and providers would compete with value-added offerings.It’s worth noting that there are a number of ongoing interoperability initiatives. These include including the SPL rulebook – promoting mobile interoperability in Europe, and SWIFT – actively working on establishing fast and efficient cross-border payments.The key P2P considerationsIf you are operating in the P2P payments market or plan to enter it, there are several key P2P considerations:Implement country or region level payment scheme and governance such as the EPI initiative in Europe.
Any solution should be based on open APIs. This way you can leverage different infrastructure for new service creation, innovation, and market penetration.
Initiate and participate in cross-border alliances for rulebooks, such as SEPA, that are supported by market participants.
Use global standards such as ISO20022 so that national infrastructures can communicate with each other.For the good of the market, it’s vital that a situation in which one closed loop scheme dominates the market is avoided. This requires an open infrastructure that promotes competition.Planning your next stepsCommercial banks must define a P2P strategy for their account holders. This means identifying ways to retain and grow the customer base through, for instance, building mobile apps that support real-time payments. Providers such as Swish in Sweden have been able to build a customer base that has grown from zero to 73% market share relatively quickly through providing value-adding services. The demand for the service clearly exists, it’s up to you to take advantage of it.Learn more about: Instant Payments Infrastructure", Edgars Bremze  ,Digitalization , 31.5.2021
How will P27 impact the payment landscape for businesses? Find out the new opportunities.,/en/blog/2021/05/how-will-p27-impact-the-payment-landscape-for-businesses/,Digitalization / Jarkko Turunen / 27.5.2021,"Payment simplification with ISO 20022When P27 Nordic Payments Platform goes live there will be a change from domestic clearing to Nordic clearing, which will see local formats, such as LB, KI or other bank-specific formats, replaced with ISO20022. It may be difficult to see an immediate return on investment. However, over time, I believe that the move to standard ERP and payment processing software to automate payment processes, will benefit businesses. Cost reduction is likely to be seen in the form of payment processing, and businesses will be able to reduce payment handling times – focusing on core business activities instead.Global harmonisationFor businesses with a global customer and supplier base, P27 Payments Platform can create new opportunities in processing domestic and Nordic payments and collections. With the ISO20022 format, they will be able to leverage existing services throughout Europe. Consolidation of payments and collections will be simplified and businesses will no longer have to rely on different processes and software in different countries. As more regions around the world move to ISO20022, these processes can be further aligned.Furthermore, with standardized formats, competition is likely to increase as ERP vendors will not have to implement country-specific formats. This also creates an opportunity for vendors to offer their services in new markets and reach a new customer base.Reduced system maintenance costsCompanies operating domestically in a Nordic country will probably have to make considerable changes to their payable and receivable systems and operations, since they are most likely supporting local formats like LB, salary and other respective local reporting formats. A system upgrade may be due, or a payment and statement format conversion will be necessary if a system upgrade is not feasible due to the timing or costs.Opting for a conversion approach may result in a loss of benefits and even the requirements of using the extended data, such as ultimate beneficiary. Again, despite the work that needs to be done in the timeframe, I believe that moving into standard formats and processes will, overtime, reduce operating costs for companies.Read also: First P27 services coming on line – Guide for banks operating in SwedenReduced number of bank accountsFor businesses with suppliers and customers across the Nordics and beyond, the value of P27 for supplier payments and collections will increase significantly. Supplier payments can be made from a single account across the Nordics and Europe. However, since currency conversion will may remain, it may be beneficial to hold accounts in different currencies.When it comes to receiving payments, one account might be sufficient. However, based on conversations with our Virtual Account Management (VAM) customers, there is evidence that paying to local account is still preferred by many.New standard payment capabilitiesI also expect new services to emerge thanks to P27. This includes salary, single and total booking services, remittance information and reconciliation services, handled by banks or 3rd parties. All of the services can be reused for ISO 20022 based payments such as P27 or SEPA, enabling standardized services regardless of payments and country.Looking at salary payments, the way of sending the salaries to banks will change dramatically. In Sweden, for example, salary payments are currently sent to Bankgirot, but as P27 goes live, the service is expected to close. This may lead to the emergence of new salary service providers.Additionally, central P27 proxy services could evolve. This will impact how a customer is identified through multiple IDs. If a bank is a member of P27, SEPA and Straks payment systems, it could reach a user through any of the systems across the Nordics.Real-time paymentsBenefits can also be found in the move to real-time payments. In short, businesses will be able to get funds in real-time from their clients and pay in real-time, giving them instant control of their financial situation – which is empowered by modern, real-time accounting system.Request to PayLooking further into the future, request-to-pay and related invoicing services can bring vast benefits to businesses in the Nordics by automating collections processes. Learning from similar services in other markets, we have seen that certain customers will pay earlier when prompted on their phones, so there is potential for reducing working capital with request-to-pay.Request-to-pay can create a unified way of paying for payments. For utility-types of payments it’s important that characteristics similar to direct debits are available. This offers an opportunity for businesses who don’t see SEPA Direct Debit as a suitable alternative for their business model.With request-to-pay going live in P27, it will be less important to know what the account number looks like, and hence, the need for having local accounts will reduce over time. Nevertheless, currency conversion must be considered.Read also: Who benefits the most from Request-to-Pay?Scale of economies and cost savingsAll in all, there are plenty of benefits from P27 for businesses of different sizes. When the payment volumes are combined into one Nordic payment platform, the economies will scale, and the cost of payments will go down.Banks can start bringing these benefits to their business clients by implementing P27 into their infrastructures.

Cloud migrationWhat is the Cloud?Cloud means an IT resource where an organization’s applications reside on a scalable cloud server instead of physical servers.Cloud services are often classified by the terms SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), referring to the particular service model in which an organization uses a cloud service. For organizations, cloud service also means that instead of owning the cloud infrastructure and data centers, they are leased from the cloud service provider and the cost is determined by usage.A functioning cloud is always based on an organization's business needs and goals. The purpose of the cloud is to increase the agility and innovation capacity of an organization, while bringing the latest technologies.A well-functioning cloud brings unbeatable benefits such as scalability according to need and use, which creates cost-effectiveness and wide usability. Increasing automation and ease of maintenance in turn increase operational efficiency. Robust data security is another essential cloud benefit.Discover our cloud servicesCheck out the blog: Cloud transformation is a trip you don’t want to missCloud computingCloud computing means generally providing different services through the Internet. These cloud computing services include tools, apps, data storage, servers and software. Instead of having these on physical servers, in cloud computing, they are located on and accessed from cloud storage.Benefits & advantages of cloud computingCloud computing and cloud services offer numerous benefits for organizations, including the following:Increased operational efficiency and excellence through automation and easy maintenance.
Enhanced innovation capabilities through improved agility and speed.
Cost savings that come with pay-as-you-use scalability and improved efficiency.
Robust data security with the latest security tools.
Increase organizational agility to become more responsive to market shifts, changes in consumer behaviour and other patterns, thus enabling them to adapt more quickly by developing faster digital products.Check out the blog: Cloud computing powers the data economy – of course, but how?Service models of Cloud computingCloud services are often classified by the terms SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), to name a few critical examples. These refer to the service model in which an organization uses a cloud service. Check out these terms and more in detail below!SaaSSoftware as a Service (SaaS) is a software licensing and distribution model through which a cloud provider hosts and manages software applications for its users. SaaS is also known as “on-demand software”, and typical SaaS applications are web applications that are available over the Internet, with functions such as invoicing, customer relationship management (CRM) and service desk management.Because these software applications are accessed via web browser, the users never need to think about set-up, updates or maintenance. The cloud provider manages the application and the users pay a subscription fee to gain access.Read more about our application servicesPaaSPlatform as a Service (PaaS) is a service model that allows its users to run and manage applications without having to build and maintain the infrastructure associated with that process. PaaS is suitable for developers and programmers as it enables high-level programming with reduced complexity. The users manage the applications and services, and the cloud provider manages everything else, typically via a pay-as-you-go model.aPaaSApplication Platform as a Service (aPaaS) is sometimes used interchangeably with PaaS, but it can be seen as a subcategory that includes only the services required for application development.IaaSInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing in which the cloud provider manages the infrastructure (meaning servers, compute, network and storage resources) for users. The infrastructure is delivered over the Internet and accessed through an API or dashboard. While the cloud provider manages the infrastructure, the users are responsible for purchasing and managing their own operating systems, middleware and applications. IaaS enables users to scale resources up and down with demand via a pay-as-you-go model. This allows user to avoid high expenditures associated with buying and managing infrastructure, along with the burden of owning unnecessary infrastructure during fluctuating workloads.Read more about our infrastructure servicesTypes of CloudThere are 4 main types of cloud computing: private cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud, and multi-clouds. To get the best value out of a cloud solution, it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of current solutions, identify the business objectives these solutions are failing to meet and evaluate those results to define a cloud solution that best suits your organization and its goals.Private CloudCloud computing dedicated for (use by) only one business or organization, has a secure private network and is not accessible to outsiders.

Can your lending history become a competitive advantage and drive portfolio profitability?,/en/blog/2021/05/can-your-lending-history-become-a-competitive-advantage-and-drive-portfolio-profitability/,Digitalization / Aleksandr Peussa  / 27.5.2021,"Why? If you consider the whole lending process – from application to full loan repayment – the entire lending lifecycle can be optimized by utilizing data science and AI. Win rates, approval rates, credit losses, customer retention, and churn – all these can be modeled to deliver ROI.Impacting the lending processA bank has three main ways to affect the lending process: sales and marketing strategy, credit risk appetite, and pricing. AI enables you to find combinations of and trade-offs between them to maximize the profit and return on allocated capital. Business-wise, that means that instead of simply minimizing credit losses or maximizing sales, a bank should concentrate on profit maximization.It’s simple economics, the higher the interest rate, the higher the potential revenue. However, with that comes a lower win rate and higher churn, which leads to obvious repercussions. The same applies to credit risk appetite. The tighter the credit policy, the smaller the credit losses, but at the same time sales suffer due, in part, to low credit approval rates. In the language of mathematics, the bank faces a multidimensional optimization problem with several variables affecting each other. This poses an enormous challenge for human beings but presents a vast opportunity for AI.Automating the credit lifecycleHere at Credit Solution and Services, we develop software platforms that automate credit processes throughout the entire credit lifecycle. But that’s just one side of the coin – the other is supporting our clients in their daily operations, with strategic decision-making and general improvements to their operational efficiency.That’s why we’re meeting lending-related challenges through the creation of Intelligent products with embedded AI capabilities. This will not only provide companies with all the analytics necessary to optimize their businesses but also make it possible to translate business decisions into immediate actions.J.P Morgan famously said “lending is not about money and property, it is about character” and this is how we operate – we try to understand the end customers’ character and predict their future behavior. The solution gains an insight overview of the banks’ data assets, and by using machine learning methodology, estimates the likelihood of various events happening during the lending lifecycle before summarizes them, without compromising the data.In other words, our AI solution goes through the whole loan lifecycle – from loan origination to loan closure in order to estimate what is an expected revenue stream. Based on this, it provides knowledge-based recommendations to enhance your profitability.Essentially, this means that a bank can utilize AI to guide them when determining: what is the optimal credit risk appetite, what is an adequate pricing policy and how to best control customer acquisition costs. It also broadens a bank’s capabilities to develop personalized offerings and customized service models.If you want to make your history a competitive advantage, intensify portfolio profitability or just hear more about our AI-based solutions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

"Which one should you choose? -  Private, Public, Hybrid or Multi-Cloud?",/en/blog/2021/04/Which-one-should-you-choose-Private-Public-Hybrid-or-Multi-Cloud/,Cloud / Rune Kilstad / 26.5.2021,"To get the best value out of a Cloud solution, it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of current solutions, identify the business objectives these solutions are failing to meet, and evaluate those results to define a Cloud solution that truly suits your organization and its goals the best.Below is a quick overview of the different types of available Cloud solutions and what may be the best fit for individual use case.4 main types of cloud computingPublic Cloud – IT services are maintained and hosted by an external provider. Delivered digitally and shared across organizations. For instance, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud. Public cloud offers vast choices in terms of solutions and computing resources to address the growing needs of organizations of all sizes and verticals.
Private Cloud – Cloud computing dedicated for (use by) only one business or organization, has a secure private network and is not accessible to outsiders. Private clouds are often used by financial institutions, government and any other mid- to large-sized organizations with business-critical operations seeking enhanced control over their environment.
Hybrid Cloud – Type of cloud computing that uses both public and private Clouds. In highly regulated industries, data residency requirements may require certain sets of data to be kept on-premise, while other workloads can be located in the public cloud.
Multi-Cloud - A cloud approach utilizing more than two cloud service, from more than one cloud vendor—public or private across several cloud-hosting environments. Having multiple clouds is becoming more common across enterprises that seek to improve security and performance through an expanded portfolio of environments.Many considerations go into managing different applications because of their requirements. It is critical to decide which Cloud solution - public or private - to deploy. We will therefore compare the advantages and disadvantages associated with these solutions when it comes to cost, maintenance, scalability, reliability, and security:CostDespite the fact that any transition from one cloud environment to another usually incurs certain costs (such as costs for management, integration, data transfers, and platforms), transitioning to a new cloud environment can be a good way to save on IT spend overall. In general, public cloud services have more flexible pricing structures than private cloud services. However, the total cost of the cloud service depends heavily on the needs of the organization, making it difficult to say that one type of cloud service generally requires a bigger investment than the other.MaintenanceAs a customer of a public cloud solution, you obviously do not need to think about maintenance. The provider takes care of maintenance and manages the infrastructure. For private cloud, on the other hand, one must be aware that it requires good planning and expertise and can entail extra costs if one is to upgrade the infrastructure without affecting business processes.In a hybrid cloud, there are strategies and tools that can help simplify the maintenance and management of a hybrid environment. These are methods that create a streamlined approach across environments, where a cloud service provider can help.A cloud service provider is required to maintain a multi-cloud solution. This can lead to complications and force an adaptation of the processes as the companies' data is moved across different cloud platforms.ScalabilityPublic cloud solutions are highly flexible and scalable and can meet changing workloads by increasing or decreasing the resources required at any given time. For private cloud solutions, however, limited scalability can make it difficult to meet unforeseen needs. The capacity of local data centres can be a limiting resource.Hybrid cloud provides more resource opportunities via public cloud providers, compared to a physical data center. Therefore, the hybrid solution makes it easier to supply, implement, and scale resources to meet periods of increased demand.For multi-cloud, scalability is about being able to provide flexibility in the form of keeping an application in a private cloud infrastructure but combined with the ability to move to a public cloud to gain extra capacity if necessary.Reliability and securityPublic cloud solutions are characterized as highly reliable and consist of a large network of servers that ensure that errors are avoided. For a private cloud platform, the reliability aspect is often affected by the fact that mobile users may have limited access, due to strict security measures.A hybrid cloud approach provides both predictability, increased reliability, and better security, since the most sensitive data can be stored in a more closed and controlled private cloud environment, as an extra layer of security.The multi-cloud approach can help you reduce the chances of major IT disasters, as not all eggs are laid in the same basket. Thus, it also ensures better reliability.You need a cloud partnerIt is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the various cloud models and to be aware that many companies must continue to relate in full or partly to traditional operating models. Then the choice of cloud platform can be a consequence of the individual company's application portfolio. Many people rely on applications that can not be moved, or that there is nothing to gain from moving to the cloud. Then the right focus should be application modernization.TietoEVRY helps large and small businesses in various industries to make these choices, and transition seamlessly to the Cloud.Book a Cloud Discovery & Assessment with us here.", Rune Kilstad ,Cloud , 26.5.2021

Time for a public cloud strategy,/en/blog/2021/05/why-your-organization-needs-a-public-cloud-strategy-now-more-than-ever/,Cloud / Pete Nieminen / 19.5.2021,"Every organization needs a public cloud strategyWhy? To understand you’ll need my explanation of what a public cloud strategy actually is: a decision-making framework and a guideline on how to use the public cloud to expand your current enterprise architecture (EA) in the optimal way to support your business and create real business scalability in the process.The strategy itself can be short and simple or long and comprehensive. I have seen cloud landing zone documents more than 200 pages long. They should not be part of the strategy but instead viewed as operational technical guidance.Last year work hours increased while productivity decreased; this year working hours are increasing even faster, but so is productivity. Is this a good thing? The short answer is no; people will reach their limit eventually. Cloud, automation, and self-service thinking are required to create the same productivity results with a less demanding workload.A non-existent or ineffective strategy leads to insufficient use of resources. The public cloud creates a particular challenge because most traditional management systems (ITIL, SAFe, Cobit, and even ISO 27001) do not really apply anymore. SIAM (service integration and management) does not quite seem to do the job anymore, and even the IT terminology is a matter of argument.So what does a public cloud strategy contain? First of all, it should be directly linked to the business strategy and tactical business plan. It can and probably should be part of the enterprise strategy, but should not be seen as inferior to it, or restricted by it. Rather, it should be an extension of the enterprise strategy that helps to transform tired old processes into new and agile ones.The public cloud is always 24/7, always agile, and always evolving. It is not about people working 24/7, but rather automation working on a near-infinite scale.You should first ask yourself this important (and often neglected) question: Why are you making the strategy in the first place?Here is a list of basics that I recommend including:Relation to and order of compliance with your current EA
Journey, roadmap, and milestones
Expectations in terms of business and financial gains
Cost optimization (CloudFinOps), continuous development
Process management and ways of working (Mode 2, DevOps, MVP, cloud as-a-code)
Multi-cloud strategy, landing zones, tools, data management, automation
Cybersecurity management, zero-trust, DR, IAM, and security by design
Partner management (hyperscalers, Cloud SIAM, solution licensing, vendor lock-ins)
Comprehensive competence management and communications plan
Other cloud-related technologies (integrations, tooling, application management)Without a proper public cloud strategy you’ll end up wasting a lot of time and money; you won’t be able to address the future needs of an agile enterprise, cope with economic changes, or keep pace with better-prepared competitors. A good analogy is the COVID pandemic, where businesses who had prepared and were agile suffered only minor disruptions while those who had not prepared were in turmoil and on the verge of bankruptcy.With a proper public cloud strategy in place both your business and information management will be agile, scalable, competitive, and future proof.Read more: SAP on Public Cloud", Pete Nieminen ,Cloud , 19.5.2021
What next for The Polite Type?,/en/blog/2021/05/what-next-for-the-polite-type/,Sustainability / Kia Haring / 17.5.2021,"When we launched The Polite Type in August 2020, it was very much a conversation starter and a prototype for potential digital tools that could make the web safer for children, young people, and other vulnerable groups. It was intended first and foremost, an educational tool and as such, has been adopted and used by a number of schools internationally. But the project has been educational for us, too.From the beginning, we made The Polite Type’s source code openly available and invited users to give us feedback and ideas on how to develop this further. We’re happy to say we received a number of suggestions from users around the world, from those working with language to people working in tech, interested in developing the tool forward. Our next steps for The Polite Type are largely based on the conversations we had with them.Based on feedback from different interest groups we have a number of ideas for developing the font’s word library: with insight from different groups we are able to update some issues that have been pointed out and find new areas where to extend the vocabulary, such as gendered language.Technical issues to iron out include the amount of word substitutions within the OpenType file, the extent of the word library, and understanding context around different words – some expressions can be harmless in one instance, and hurtful in another. Most of the limitations of the current solution come from the fact that the OpenType format is used in a way it was not designed to function. Future iterations of the font will hopefully have a better understanding of context and the ability to quickly pick up new words as language evolves.Later this year, we’ll be unveiling the next language version of The Polite Type as a German version of the font will be launched. We are currently looking into options of expanding the project through relevant partnerships and, in the meantime hope to keep the conversation around online equality and safety going.Read also: Taking a stand against cyberbullying and discrimination – Polite Type now launched in three countries", Kia Haring ,Sustainability , 17.5.2021
3 Keys to benefit from Security Operations,/en/blog/2021/05/3-Keys-to-benefit-from-Security-Operations/,Cybersecurity insights /  Piotr Zawadzki  / 12.5.2021,"A healthy SOC is at the heart of cyber defence, but what it takes to establish and operate one has changed along with the evolving threat landscape, putting a tremendous responsibility on security analysts and the technologies they rely on.By incorporating advanced analytics and automation tools, and boosting incident response capabilities, can ease the security operations load and arm yourself with the people, processes, and technologies needed to overcome today's cybersecurity challenges.Here are 3 keys on how security operations enhance your security:Implement Advanced Analytics: Enable capabilities such as threat and vulnerability management, incident prioritization, advanced threat detection, and threat hunting and investigating. All, by choosing advanced analytics as the foundation for your security operations. Many organizations rely heavily on SIEM to support compliance and threat detection efforts. Organizations are also increasingly combining their deployments with solutions that really takes their analytics abilities to the next level.
Integrate controls & automate processes: Enable analysts to make better decisions from better data. It may not be a surprise that automating your security operations will strengthen your team’s skills and expertise to detect and respond to threats with super speed.
Boost incident response: Group detected threats and avoid bottlenecks in Incident Response processes. The incident response must be as proactive as possible and needs to comply with a predefined rulebook to answer strictly or help construct the same on experience basis.The only way to protect your organization from the increasing amount of threats is to be vigilant when it comes to cybersecurity.Want to learn more?

The alternative is the Next-generation SOCs: it offers an integrated incident response and more sophisticated threat identification and mitigation.Let us take a closer look at how the future of SOC looks like.The traditional SOC needs modernization to keep pace with the evolving business and threat landscapes. Below are some bullet points of the changing environment of traditional SOC:Traditionally, SOC detects threats based on data; the increase in telemetry data requires new threat detection mechanisms and updated thread detection feeds​
Enterprises are expanding at a dizzying pace, causing most threat detection platforms to age fairly quickly​
SOC activities that were based on generating ""alerts"" are becoming a thing of the past; this task has been taken over by modern security systems such as EDR, NDFW, UEBA etc​
Technology’s role in the modern SOC is to e.g. minimize response times; reduce human error; and facilitate proactive cybersecurity management ​
The proactive role of SOC in detecting threats is becoming a fact today, not one of the ""features""​Therefore, the need for a next generation SOC arises to assure monitoring data that extends beyond the organization into cloud services, mobile devices, and more monitoring security across the enterprise has become harder because of a constantly growing attack surface due to Digital transformation, cloud migration, and enterprise mobility​.Organizations are collecting analytics data at multiple tiers, trying to glue together an understanding of their security posture, lacking an integrated way to collect, process, analyze, and act upon the data.Building a full stack in-house cybersecurity is an extreme challenge due to high need for financing, and expertise gaps. The SOC as a service is recommended for organizations that:​Want an intelligent solution to gain a total overview of security events, flows and user behavior in their network ​

Why everybody is interested in your jet/wire ratio and other views on your Artificial Intelligence strategy,/en/blog/2021/05/why-everybody-is-interested-in-your-jetwire-ratio-and-other-views-on-your-artificial-intelligence-strategy/,Data / Heikki  Taskinen  / 12.5.2021,"Three fundamental questions are:Are you focusing on data itself instead of value adding applications?
Do you use AI for analytics only or do you consider AI also as a process controltool?
Are you struggling with cloud of cloud services?Many companies currently have data and AI on their agenda. Their focus is very much on how to manage the data, what kind of data platform to create or what kind of organization to form for governing the data. Since there is an increasing pressure to achieve something, lots of experiments around the data are conducted, often labelled as Proof of Concept.Data is valuable only when put in real usePressure, however, is mounting to start seeing real-world AI applications. The time of experimenting is over, and companies are beginning to demand real results from AI. Companies can spend a lot of time setting up their data governance and platforms while business is eagerly waiting for the time when they can start projects making good use of the data. That, hopefully, puts pressure on IT and data organizations.It would be wise to begin from the desired outcomes, to find real business challenges that can be resolved with the help of data and AI. When there is a clear need to resolve a problem and get real business benefits, then the work with data also becomes better focused.AI for analytics or process control?That takes us to our second subject. As a “use case” for data and AI, companies often mention analytics. AI is considered yet another tool to analyse data. Technology companies are providing analytics tools on their platforms, so the focus is very much on the data itself and technical tools.Another viewpoint is to make AI part of operations and process control. This puts everything in another perspective. When AI is embedded into existing operational systems at the mill, or AI algorithms are actually allowed to run the process, its value increases. Numerous customer cases already prove that.This in turn forces you to think where AI should be running. Should it run far away in the cloud, close to analytics tools, or should it run close to operations, processes, and data? It is obvious that AI will become as business-critical a component as process and quality control systems currently are.The struggle with cloud of cloudsThe jet/wire ratio is a good example of how cloud of cloud services jump into the AI discussion. Why is everybody interested in the jet/wire ratio, and why is this a problem?Jet/wire ratio is an interesting process value because it affects so many things at the mill. Your chemical supplier needs it in their wet end chemistry analysing service, provided from their cloud. Your paper machine supplier may want it in their cloud service to control web strength. Another partner is offering you a web break analytics tool, and the jet/wire ratio is obviously a key data tag to follow. Your predictive maintenance and condition monitoring partners might also be interested in it and want it included in their cloud-based service.This means there is a cloud of cloud services that all need your process data.You might say you replicate the jet/wire ratio to your cloud and all your partners are welcome to use it for their particular needs from there. Big respect to companies who have advanced this far. The reality, though, is different in many companies. Unresolved issues are whether those cloud services are actually able to control the process, or how the customer who is buying those cloud services can utilise the results of AI algorithms in their own systems.To conclude, data & AI strategy, technical platform, data governance, and experiments are highly relevant activities in companies right now – but the most important target should be to provide real value-adding solutions to create real and tangible business benefits.", Heikki  Taskinen  ,Data , 12.5.2021
"Time to move beyond legacy. Is on-prem, hosted, SaaS or BPO best for your bank?",/en/blog/2021/04/time-to-move-beyond-legacy.-is-on-prem-hosted-saas-or-bpo-best-for-your-bank/,Digitalization / Toms  Jansons / 11.5.2021,"A bank’s time is better spent focusing on the customer experience – where it can differentiate itself in the market.In our experience, too many banks and financial institutions are sat with aging, legacy in-house systems, leaving them with little choice but to develop their own, resource-heavy code. Just maintaining these in-house systems can drain budgets leaving limited resources for developing new customer-oriented features. Many of these systems are so old that the little documentation that exists is no longer relevant due to the number of patches that have been implemented over the years. Unfortunately, this may leave a bank in the hands of a limited group of key people that know or understand the system. In short, a risky policy in a risk-averse industry.Technology-based competitive advantageIf you recognise this issue in your operations, you will also be aware that new, agile players and competitors that have transitioned their systems are beginning to chip away at your revenues. They don’t have the burden of paying for the upkeep of an old system, since they’re using tailored software to target value-adding services at your customers. Technology has given them a competitive advantage - a proven vendor solution can help you get this back.Outsourcing the front and backendVendor solutions offer many benefits, no matter if they are on-prem, hosted, SaaS or Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), or on the front or backend.We often see banks outsourcing front office (online) services to vendors to reduce the cost of managing regulatory, security, and international card organisations’ requirements. On the backend, reducing costs is also one of the main drivers for many banks when they migrate from legacy inhouse systems. Big savings can be made when you don’t have to allocate IT resources to ensure regulatory compliance with GDPR, PSD2, PCI DSS as well as any local requirements. And as we all know, regulations will continue to get stricter and stricter, which will further stretch resources. Add to this the regular updates from international card operators and it becomes clear why these costs are better shared among multiple banks and financial institutions through a vendor model.What our clients sayWe spoke with our clients to find out their key drivers for transitioning from a legacy system. Many of the answers were the same regardless of the deployment model.Co-sharing of development and regulatory costs with other financial institutions
Complying with regulatory and security requirements
Resource constraints
Difficulty in finding skilled IT team members
Faster time to market – not held back by legacy codes and systems
Reduction of legacy system maintenance and management costs
Early access to proven new initiatives
Flexibility of new functionality, open and testing approachWhich deployment modelThe arguments for replacing legacy systems are obvious - but choosing which model of service delivery is right for your bank will depend on your market and digital roadmap.In the Nordics, for instance, SaaS and BPOs are commonly used by banks when outsourcing. In this mature market where the main differentiators are the terms of the card and the customer interface, resources are freed up to focus on other financial services. Thanks to the service maturity level, on-prem is on par with the other deployment models.Looking beyond this market, we see clear differences. In countries where cards are a relatively new and a fast-growing business, the card business can still provide a competitive edge as financial services are. This offers an opportunity for banks to invest early in a vendor platform, where the infrastructure may be better suited for hosted or inhouse services.Then there are large banking groups that often choose to consolidate card processing in one location. Those who don’t outsource services, often still look to gain the benefits of vendor solutions in the form of inhouse management of services. This can be done through their own processing centres based on legacy upgrades.Flexibility is keyWhen choosing a deployment model, it’s essential to remember flexibility is key. After all, the market we know today will not be the market we will know tomorrow. There is no one-fits-all solution, no single right way how to deploy software. Each bank has their own path and it’s not uncommon to choose a combination of options. Your provider should be able to provide you with each option and advise and support you with deployment to ensure you remain competitive, reduce costs and maximize revenues. In conclusion…No matter how mature or immature the market is, or how big your bank group is, you will have to compete with the ever-growing number of neo-banks and fintechs. They can’t and won’t offer all the service you do. But they will cherry-pick, and legacy systems are simply not competitive in such a landscape.If your bank continues with a legacy approach, you should at least consider migrating the core functions to vendors. That way you can focus resources on the customer experience, the customer interface, and any value-adding services on top of core card functionality – such as mobile apps with personal finance tools. That’s the best way to compete with the neobanks.Related blogs:Bringing lost revenues back to the cards business via credit servicesThe Fintech dilemma: how to evaluate and collaborate to bring added value to the cards businessTokenization: the secure way to support merchants, consumers and IoT paymentsLearn more on Card and financial product management related blog and insight series, case studies and more - click here.", Toms  Jansons ,Digitalization , 11.5.2021
How developing my communication skills made me a better solution architect.,/en/blog/2021/05/how-developing-my-communication-skills-made-me-a-better-solution-architect/,Meet our people / Françoise Bouchet Strøm / 10.5.2021,"I started at Tietoevry as a developer in 2001. When writing this blog, I asked myself “what makes a project fly, and what makes a project crash?”. I quickly realized that the common mistake we often make is under valuating the human side of our business, the communication skills. It’s this skillset that often turns out to be the “make it or break it factor” in a large digital project.Why you should sharpen your ears and listen more closelyWhen I say “communications skills” I try to look beyond the usual idea of being “well spoken”. I’m not just focusing on rhetoric, although you need to be able to pitch an idea and deliver your message in your everyday work.There are however other skills in the communications tool box that are just as important. Listening for example. 20 years in Tietoevry have taught me that a solution architect never works alone. Especially in a global company like ours, with more than 20 000 employees.Internally, we’re dependent on good collaboration. This means you constantly have to listen, interpret and analyze your colleagues needs and wishes on a daily basis. In a project meeting, you interact with product owners, developers, sales people and designers. You all rely on each other’s competence, but to trigger a good collaboration you need to understand each others needs. A solution architect creates a common ground from which new ideas can emerge. It’s in this sweet spot that the digital magic happens.Dig deep into what the customer actually wantsListening however is not just a skill you need internally. It is crucial when meeting the customer. I’ve lost track of how many customer meetings I’ve been in since I started in 2001. But I see some similarities that keep repeating themselves.In a meeting, the customer may request new features added to the solutions we deliver. They’re often very clear on exactly what they want. Then I as an active listener have to dig deeper into the customer’s idea and ask myself “What is their actual need?” or “How can we solve it differently, faster, more cost efficiently?”. What I’m saying is, that by listening closely and analyzing the need you enable yourself to be more proactive and create greater value.Bridge the gap between soft and hard skills? No, truth is that there wasn’t a gap to begin withAlthough I don’t do a lot of coding anymore in my role as a solution architect, I value the experience I have from working technically. I think it makes you better equipped to understand the everyday struggles your team is dealing with.If you take a step back, you realize it’s not about “one or the other”. We shouldn’t be so quick to think that a person is either very “technical” or more of a “people’s person”. It is a myth.In the real world, your technical skills, your listening skills, analysis, rhetoric and common sense all has to blend together, for you to create first class digital services. But you have to like that type of dynamic environment. Speaking from my point of view, I’ve learnt new things about tech, the people I work with and myself every day for the last 20 years. And by the look of it, I will enjoy it for at least another 20!Interested in pioneering the Future of FinTech?

Technical roles need soft skills – why I became a team player and diversified my skills,/en/blog/2021/05/technical-roles-need-soft-skills--why-i-became-a-team-player-and-diversified-my-skills/,Meet our people / Eugenia  Spano / 7.5.2021,"I never gave much thought to my communication, ability to work in a team, or leadership skills. I thought a technical role should focus on the technical stuff, and that soft skills were secondary.Fast forward to today – three years and eight teams later – and I can say that I was wrong.On average, a full-time employee will spend a third of their life working. That is quite a high percentage of our time. At the risk of sounding cliché, it is up to us to make the best of it. So how can we do that? How can we ensure that we actually enjoy this time we spend at work? In all honesty, I have yet to figure out the full recipe, but I can share with you the few ingredients that have worked for me so far.We are people, before we are employeesIt might seem obvious, but it is something I often forget and it makes a huge difference. We are people, and as people we have various emotions, feelings and needs. It is called diversity, and it is a key factor for succeeding in our work. I would stretch it even further and say that as people, we need each other to be able to thrive. As employees, this well-being is necessary to be able to solve complex problems for our customers.Sometimes, being a good team player just requires us to remind ourselves of our humanity. This may mean proposing to take a break, turn our camera on during online meetings, or simply smiling and asking each other how we are doing. It doesn’t always have to be about work.It’s the team that makes the leaderThis is a sentence I first heard at the Women In Tech conference, and it really stuck with me. I think it perfectly captures the essence of teamwork and the power of good collaboration: there is no success without a supporting team, and there is no team without collaboration. It can happen – especially in these times while working from home and not having many human interactions – that we feel like we are alone. This small sentence reminds me that I am part of some great teams, and that it just takes a second to write a message in the common chat and ask someone to work together with me to lift my mood. It’s another side of collaboration – one that goes beyond the daily work that we do.Being a team player might seem like a small thing, but it has made all the difference. It has enabled me to have more fun at work, it has given me a chance to learn much more than what I could have done on my own, and it has contributed positively to the well-being of my colleagues as well. Now I know that even for a deeply-technical role such as mine, soft skills are not just secondary, but rather a powerful asset that should be cherished and cultivated.", Eugenia  Spano ,Meet our people , 7.5.2021
Wealth trends 2021: Democratization of wealth,/en/blog/2021/05/democratization-of-wealth/,Data / Sameer Datye / 6.5.2021,"From an investment advisory perspective, there has always been a lopsided focus on wealthy people and institutions. However, 3 main catalysts have increasingly started correcting this concentration of attention and widened the field more: market demand, availability of instrument and technology as an enabler.Market demandAwareness on insufficiency of pensions. With the realisation that pensions are not going to help address retirement needs, there is increased awareness to have alternative savings in place.
Evaporating traditional job market has led to the need of having alternative income/saving possibilities.AvailabilityFinancial institutions open towards addressing retail customers. Realising the potential of the retail market, they start looking beyond traditional High-net-worth individuals/Institutional focus.
Mainstreaming of non-traditional investment options. Cryptocurrencies, art, wine, stamps, rare diamonds etc. are either accessible by default or have started becoming accessible. Hence the potential for mainstream investing.TechnologyEnable mass access to traditional market. Technology evolution and innovations have made it possible for participation in financial markets in large numbers. It is not only about ability to trade. It is also about education and capacity building so that retail investors are empowered.
Enable mass access to non-traditional market. With partial share possibilities on non-traditional investment opportunities like art and wines, it is suddenly within the sphere of a retail investor. Cryptocurrencies by nature have been “democratic” instruments.A growing interestThe non-traditional instruments have been gathering a lot of interest, and rightly so.

Learning as a Lifestyle - Together with Microsoft,/en/blog/2021/05/growth-mindset-and-learning-as-a-lifestyle---together-with-microsoft/,Meet our people / Kristina Devochko / 5.5.2021,"By investing in career development and continuous learning we are aiming to grow and motivate those movers, innovators and shakers in our society-the ones who will drive forward the digitalization journey in the Nordics, and in the world.One of the world's most known motivational speakers, Brian Tracy, said:“Those people who develop the ability to continuously acquire new and better forms of knowledge that they can apply to their work and to their lives will be the movers and shakers in our society for the indefinite future.”-And I can’t agree more. IT industry is one of the most dynamic and rapidly changing industries in the world. In order to move ahead and stay on the top in the competitive market and in our Public 360°team, you must keep up with new trends, frameworks and technologies. But in the modern world it’s not always that easy to find time for learning and competence development, especially at work. Handling customer commitments, deadlines and delivery projects in addition to maintaining a work-life balance makes it challenging for many of us to keep track of everything at once.What Public 360° really is?We take on the mission of simplifying everyday life by creating better citizen services. You can read more about what our solution can do here: Public 360° -Case and document management system.So, what concrete actions do we take in order to achieve this?One of the most exciting and successful initiatives we have currently undertaken, in cooperation with Microsoft, is Public 360°Azure Boot Camp. This tech challenge is based on Microsoft’s learning initiative known as Cloud Skills Challenge(CSC). Cloud Skills Challenge is a company-focused, gamified way to learn and skill up using Microsoft Learn paths/modules. A set of modules for such challenge can either be based on one of the pre-made collections, provided by Microsoft, or you can make a custom set by hand-picking the modules that will be most relevant for the challenge participants. Modules we have chosen for Public 360° Azure Boot Camp were based on Azure Development collection. Duration of the challenge can also be customized, depending on the amount of included modules. Public 360°Azure Boot Camp was running for two weeks and included 41 modules covering different areas of Azure development – from creating server less logic with Azure Functions to protecting against security threats on Azure.94 people have participated in Public 360°Azure Boot Camp and 11 people have fully completed the challenge – all 41 modules in just two weeks! Public 360°team has over 100 developers working from different parts of the globe and seeing such interest, engagement and activity was extremely heart-warming and exciting for us! According to Microsoft, Public 360°Azure Boot Camp is so far the largest challenge by the number of participants among all challenges running in Norway –how cool is that?!After Public 360°Azure Boot Camp ended, we received a lot of positive feedback about this initiative-it became crystal clear for us that people are eager to gain new knowledge and grow their skillset, and they definitely want to see more initiatives like this in the future. Even those employees who haven’t been working with Azure in their daily work responded to the challenge and took advantage of this opportunity to upskill and learn more about what Azure is and what it has to offer for product development.It makes me proud to be a part of the organization where competence development is encouraged. Where learning initiatives are promoted and implemented on a regular basis, and are strongly supported by the leadership. Where employees express how important it is to have learning opportunities as part of their daily work. In addition to that, it’s extremely valuable to have this kind of collaboration with the developer community and our partners, Microsoft being one of them.Microsoft team has provided us with immense support along the way -from helping us land what kind of learning initiatives would be the most relevant for us to start with, to setting up the challenge itself and dedicating symbolic prizes to all the challenge participants. Big thanks to everyone involved for your contribution and the efforts made to succeed with Public 360°Azure Boot Camp!Finally, I would like to say that TietoEVRY and Public 360° are not stopping there! We will keep up our continuous learning journey and further collaboration with Microsoft on creating more competence development opportunities and learning initiatives like this for our people.Have you heard of Cloud Skills Challenge and have you participated in one?

Biometrics: Securing a future for payment cards,/en/blog/2021/05/biometrics-securing-a-future-for-payment-cards/,Cybersecurity insights / Steve Warner / 3.5.2021,"By now, there can be no doubt that our economy is going digital, driven by the widespread adoption of mobile devices and consumer appetite for purchasing online, whether via computer or mobile device. In the US alone, digital commerce sales grew by more than 32% in the last year to reach $794.5 billion, according to e-marketer.Given this ongoing trend towards digitisation, banks are increasingly offering customers digital wallets for use in online and physical environments. This is understandable: digital wallets offer the attraction of adding more functions in the future, from loyalty schemes to micro-lending and insurance products, as well as today’s online and physical payments functionality.Although NFC World reports the number of digital wallets will rise to 4 billion by 2024 with spending via wallets doubling by 2025, it’s important not to lose sight of the importance of cards now and in the future. The Nilsson Report 2021 tells us there are more than 22.1 billion payment cards in circulation, a number that continues to grow by around 4 percent a year. For the foreseeable future, then, cards are still going to play an important role – indeed, evidence suggests that consumers still prefer to pay by card despite the growing range of options on offer.A preference for contactlessIn January 2021, we conducted research showing that contactless card transactions now account for up to 80 percent of all face-to-face payments in the UK, with similar results recorded in Norway and Sweden. In the United States, research from Visa also shows more than two-thirds of consumers prefer to pay with contactless cards as they are more familiar with them than with payment via a digital wallet on their mobile device.Globally, COVID-19 has accelerated a move towards contactless transactions, and regulators are responding: the limit for contactless transactions in the UK rose to £100 (€110) per transaction from 6th April 2021, with an increase in the EU from €35 to €50. In the US, meanwhile, there is no federally mandated limit on contactless credit card transactions, with issuers setting their own limits according to customer profiles and their risk appetite.More opportunity, greater riskRising contactless limits offer consumers greater opportunities to pay safely and quickly in a wider range of situations. With higher limits, customers can pay for luxury items as well as everyday purchases using contactless. At the same time, higher limits bring with them greater risk, especially from lost and stolen cards. Criminals can quickly rack up high-value transactions on contactless cards, however quickly a loss or theft is reported.Biometrics: the future of card securityBiometric cards work via a sensor on the card which captures an image of the cardholder’s fingerprint, confirming this with a record of the fingerprint stored securely in the card’s chip. This data flow is powered by the same circuit used by the POS terminal’s near-field communication (NFC) for existing contactless cards, meaning terminal upgrades and other system changes are minimal.As our white paper demonstrates, half of the consumers we surveyed across the UK, Sweden and Norway would switch bank to get a biometric card, while more than 80 percent of consumers want to take part in a biometric trial as soon as possible. Enthusiasm for biometric security is such that more than half (55.4 percent) of UK consumers said they would pay more for a biometric card, with 66 percent saying they wanted to get one as soon as possible (34 percent), or at some point in the next year (32 percent) – figures broadly repeated in both Norway and Sweden.While banks’ efforts to move into a digital future are welcome, it’s important that they don’t lose sight of customers’ current spending patterns and the revenue opportunities which cards represent. Biometric cards represent a great way to offer customers enhanced security and greater convenience using a product they are comfortable and familiar with using. Looking ahead to the next decade, we believe biometrics cards will become consumers’ payment method of choice, both online and in the real world.To find out more about how biometrics are the next stage in the evolution of payment cards, download TietoEVRY’s white paper “Securing the Revolution: the next step in contactless transactions”.", Steve Warner ,Cybersecurity insights , 3.5.2021
The more the merrier,/en/blog/2021/04/the-more-the-merrier/,Cybersecurity insights / Kjell-Rune Vilhelmsen / 30.4.2021,"It started off small, with a couple of fraudulent transactions alongside many genuine ones, but it soon grew in scale across several banks, geographies and card types (debit, credit, VISA and MasterCard). Within a short time, fraudulent transactions amounted to several hundred thousands of euros.The merchant did support strong customer authentication methods, but since the misused data had been compromised by manipulation of cardholders, the cardholders’ security credentials were also compromised.This case is by no means unique; we’ve seen many similar ones recently. And many actors working in the anti-fraud area see them every day. We have of course removed sensitive information from the description of the case, but be assured it is a genuine one. Anyway, the details of the case are less important.What is at stake here is that even though this case had the potential to become a major fraud event, it was successfully mitigated and minimized – at least for customers of TietoEVRY’s managed service.Only a few transactions slipped through before our experienced investigators as well as the transaction monitoring system at our monitoring center realized what was going on and immediately shifted to damage control mode.Over a two-week period, repeated attempts were made to defraud our customers for hundreds of thousands of euros, but only 4% of the attempts were successful. The other 96% were unsuccessful because our fraud management platform detected them and prevented them from being processed.However, we believe that other banks were more severely affected by this attack, because it lasted for around two weeks, and no business-minded fraudster would settle for a meagre 4% success rate after so much effort.The more data, the better the decision-makingAs the heading of this article implies, the more data available, the better the decision-making processes and the less the likelihood of attacks and incidents like the one described above. This applies to the volume of data on a single transaction or customer portfolio and to the number of uniquely different portfolios available. Having both depth and range in data makes it possible to see both the finer details and the big picture. This is one of the key benefits of a multi-tenant managed service.Combined with the intelligence provided by our customers and partners, the aggregated knowledge about fraud and trends accumulated from studying both the details as well as the big picture is vital to us. It means our system and staff are far better equipped to deal with changes than those who only look inwards at their own data.The benefits of large volumes of data apply to all risk mitigating processes across all areas of society, whether it be cybercrime prevention, public administration or health services. Of course, there is also the need for an organization and a system to process the data and make the right decisions, but the fundamental rule remains: the more data available to make good decisions, the better the decision-making processes will be.This applies today but will apply even more so in the future as financial crime continuously evolves both in complexity and range and thereby increases the standards of expertise, knowledge, technology and cooperation required by actors like us in the anti-fraud industry.Watch our webinar!On 6 May we will hosted a webinar on the benefits of our managed financial crime prevention service. In the webinar, you will learn more about how we help banks improve their financial crime prevention efforts by pooling their data to make better decisions.Watch our webinar ""Stronger Together: The advantages of financial crime prevention as a managed service""", Kjell-Rune Vilhelmsen ,Cybersecurity insights , 30.4.2021

That means that I get the change to not only learn history from one exciting company, TietoEVRY, but also the history to the costumers I work for.I love to learn new things that I haven’t done before, and challenge myself to lean towards coding, automation and devops because these are fields I think is very interesting and important to the future, next to cloud solutions.Businesses are in transitionI think we need to have a five-year perspective on this topic, because many customers have started their journey towards the cloud or are living in a Hybrid environment. Many have been there for a while but haven’t transformed their applications into cloud native yet.They are in transition, transforming their environments from onsite to cloud based, or migrating their applications and getting ready for the next stage - Modernizing their applications and taking full advantage of the Cloud.So the main focus should be closing the gaps for customers, adding knowledge and advising on how to take the most advantage of the cloud. Helping with transition from the old to the new, focus on security, but also adopting new technologies and better ways to manage their environments.When we have helped businesses with this stage of the cloud journey, I think we will see that the future in cloud will be very much based on automation, and code in whichever form, is the future.The everyday heroesIf you work in this field, you will become the everyday heroes and the go to person.There is also very much to learn and is a very rewarding experience to be able to help ideas become reality.

Time for an API economy and it’s changing everything,/en/blog/2021/04/time-for-an-api-economy-and-its-changing-everything/,Digitalization / Edgars Bremze  / 29.4.2021,"The rise of the APIAPIs have been in use for decades in banking. But it’s only in recent years that they have been seen as customer-facing tools that can add value. Prior to this, they were simply process tools, often used as part of an agreement between a bank and a provider willing to utilize specifically developed APIs.With new regulatory requirements, especially in Europe, things began to change as APIs became a key to opening up banking. Now, we see banks looking to exploit API technology in the form of premium APIs (APIs that are not a regulatory requirement and that banks can charge a fee for their usage). These can generate new revenue streams and open up channels to onboard new customers.Common API use todayTo date, the most common business cases for APIs have been in acquiring, mainly in the form of enabling account-to-account payments for merchants, where there is a clear business case compared with existing card-based payments. In our experience, the role of APIs in issuing has been far less influential. We mainly see them used as a support for personal financial management tools. Of course, an API is only as good as the quality of its design, build and availability. It must match the quality of the service or product on offer to add value.Common API use tomorrow The list of potential opportunities is endless for those banks that are willing to embrace the API economy. In Europe, for instance, where open banking offers a legal framework (API protocols standards are not regulated, but a majority use the Berlin group standard) internal and external integrations can be unified. Should core banking, payment or card systems need to be replaced, a single external API format will make it a much smoother and more frictionless process. But what opportunities lie around the corner? How will you be able to simplify services and differentiate yourself from competitors through APIs?These are just some of the scenarios being discussed on different markets by banks looking to utilize API integrations:Authorization for a smooth and secure interface to banking services
Salary payments and budgeting services for companies with employee cards
Client scoring and card authentication via e-ID or bank-ID services
Credit & installment payments on high-value items
Trusted beneficiary lists – for frictionless transactions
Merchant loyalty programs that support monetization of points
Data fraud management through the aggregation of APIsWhy standardizedThe beauty of standardized APIs is that they give you the ability to build a broad layer of additional services – through strategic collaborations – without the legal and bureaucratic burdens typically faced by banks. The ground rules – i.e., API standards – are already in place. As a bank, you will be able to sell your services in new ways and compete with innovative products that offer a great user experience.Looking to other industries for trendsIs there a catch? Looking to other industries, we can see that there will be a time in the near future when the banking world reaches a junction, in the same way that the travel industry once did. You used to book your flights directly with an airline, your hotel directly with a hotel, and a rental car directly with a rental company. Now, you can book everything through an airline, or through an aggregator – everybody is looking for an extra slice of revenue within the travel experience and banking will become the same. The question is – how will your bank position itself?Which bank are you?Looking to the future we believe that there will be banks that strive to become service providers, banks that create the infrastructure and banks that remain in the middle. There will be much more flexibility, i.e., banks will be able to pick and choose vendors, just like customers do nowadays with bank services. Which vendor you choose could be the key to your success in the future.A system built for API integrationsHere at TietoEVRY we are convinced that API integrations will be central to the future success of banks. After all, when combined, our Card Suite and Open Banking solutions, allow banks to expose their services to third parties or aggregate additional data from other market participants. This supports easy integration and the creation of a broad range of additional value-added services.Related blogsThe Fintech dilemma: how to evaluate and collaborate to bring added value to the cards businessA digital card experience for a more profitable futureThe third generation of real-time payments is here – are you ready to embrace it?Learn more on Card and financial product management related blog and insight series, case studies and more - click here.", Edgars Bremze  ,Digitalization , 29.4.2021

There was much confusion about whether SIAM is actually something new, whether it will last, or even whether it is something relevant.SIAM was not yet well established in the Nordic market at the time, however customer demand from specific SIAM services were starting to appear. The question at the time was - will SIAM represent yet another new fancy consulting term or even hype, disappearing as so many other trends in the IT sector? Now, after 5 years we can see what really happened.In general terms - The awareness of the term SIAM has increasedWhen looking back and reflecting on current topics with our customers, it looks like the same challenges are still valid for multi-vendor IT ecosystem management and service integration.The awareness of the term SIAM framework and it's sourcing models have spread during those 5 years. In our experience working with the Nordic market, we find the need and request for SIAM services much more frequently today thanks to the improved maturity of developed SIAM offerings and deliveries in market.From our perspectiveWe started the TietoEVRY SIAM journey in 2016 - developing the 1st generation SIAM concept and offering – since followed with great customer satisfaction have expanding the offerings from real life learning utilizing best practices and certified professional team .Half-way through 2021, I can proudly say that TietoEVRY SIAM service practice engages over 20 customers from industries such as manufacturing, retail & logistics, financial & public sector, serviced by our team in the Nordic countries, adding the flexibility of near and offshore model and resources to secure geographical and competence fit for the business case of our customers.Core of SIAM is professionalism, attitude to serve with high quality and trusted co-operation in the customer IT ecosystem, where around 100 SIAM certified professionals in 6 countries globally serve satisfied customers. Most importantly, that customers can see that SIAM brings value to the value chain in their IT ecosystem. With this I see the increased importance of professional SIAM, where SIAM makes many new choices and opportunities possible going forward.SIAM has developed and become an integral part in customer’s IT organizations. Next generation SIAM embraces the opportunities in combining modern DevOps operating model. Other cross-functional topics will raise up as well – SIAM & Cloud, SIAM & IOT, SIAM & Security and we will even see strong connection between SIAM tooling area & AIOps.We are moving from ‘SIAM for IT’ towards ‘Intelligent SIAM for Digital Business and Automated Service Management.’The question is not if SIAM is here to stay – the question is more ‘what role may SIAM play for the combined IT and non-IT functions from a business development perspective and transformations?Learn more by visiting the SIAM website.", Veli Pirttiaho ,Cloud , 26.4.2021
Breaking down the barriers to AI and Machine Learning,/en/blog/2021/04/breaking-down-the-barriers-to-ai-and-machine-learning-a-new-world-of-opportunity-has-opened-up-for-the-finance-sector/,Digitalization / Jonas Brännvall / 23.4.2021,"Growth through automationHere at Credit Solution and Services, we develop software platforms that automate credit processes throughout the entire credit lifecycle. Our goal is to create services and features that help our customers grow their existing businesses and generate new business revenues. But that’s just one side of the coin – the other is simplifying and improving efficiencies, whether it’s in lending, factoring, collection or accounts.AI, the next levelAI and machine learning are a natural step in this progression – as they bring next level automation to the market and provide new exciting opportunities for growth.Of course, central to this is data – without it, machines can’t learn or analyse in order to deliver game-changing results. And this has been a stumbling block for the financial sector. But we’re now at the point where we can meet the security and regulatory concerns of the market. We can now deliver value-adding AI services based on our customers’ data.Utilising machine learningSo, how do we utilise machine learning to create real business value?Firstly, we aggregate your data in order to make sense of it. Then, we use our structured AI models, and tailor them to meet your specific market and customer offering – and the more data we receive, the smarter they become. The output we receive is then visualized in intuitive dashboards, which allows us to monitor and optimise operations and put value-adding information in the hands of your decision-makers. All this is exposed in APIs to ensure smooth integrations between systems.Proven solutionThe majority of banks trying to attempt this in-house will face a steep learning curve. Resources will have to be taken from core operations and new IT skill sets will have to be sourced. The alternative is to use our service. We’ve done the legwork; you can now take advantage of a proven solution that’s up and running.Out-of-the-box AISo what can you expect at the end of the day? Basically, we can now offer out-of-the-box AI support for lending, leasing and collection systems. And, since the data is stored in Microsoft Azure data lakes, we can bring other data sources into the data set to boost smart decision making and create new business opportunities. For instance, we are now helping our lending customers to predict loan repayments and defaults as well as their profit and loss analysis. Based on this they can take proactive action at an early stage.Essentially, with this solution, we are lowering the barriers to AI and machine learning and opening up new data-driven opportunities.

What does the future hold for “on-us” transactions?,/en/blog/2021/04/what-does-the-future-hold-for-on-us-transactions/,Digitalization / Edgars Bremze  / 22.4.2021,"1.Continued consolidation is changing acquiring business modelsIn the past banks could gain a competitive edge by offering cheaper services, knowing that virtually all customer transactions would be handled internally rather than being processed by the international card organizations. Large volumes of issuing and acquiring customers, combined with low on-us transaction costs, was a win-win situation for both issuing and acquiring business areas.However, we can now see that this trend has reversed. Many banks, particularly within Europe, now choose to outsource merchant acquiring or have even sold this part of their business. Why? Because they could no longer see any long-term value in it — acquiring had become a business of volumes and processing efficiency, and margins were shrinking. Additionally, thanks to new interchange regulations in the region, the cost difference between on-us and non on-us transaction processing from an acquirer perspective has decreased.2.The importance of card schemes continues to growMore and more value-adding services are being introduced to card schemes for both issuers and acquirers. These include tokenization and support OEM digital wallets, such as Apple, Google and Samsung Pay, to name a few. As a result, many transactions are now routed through card schemes – which could eventually end up in market monopolies. The upshot of this being that there will be fewer opportunities for on-us business models.If this trend continues, we may see the end of smaller, national payments models. There is, however, competition for the global schemes. Regional payment schemes are providing alternative payment solutions in an effort to protect their markets. You only have to look at PROSTIR in the Ukraine and NSPK in Russia to see proof of this. Then, of course, there is the European Payment Initiative, which is being co-financed by several European banks and will not rely on standard card rails.3.The right transaction route for cheaper services?The situation, of course, differs depending on the region. If the interest for on-us in Europe is diminishing, outside of Europe things are quite different as each region is at a different stage of development.There are options for acquirers to route transactions directly to the bank that has issued the card, for the sake of cheaper transaction processing. Transactions can be routed to any bank on the market, i.e. via the lowest-cost option, it’s just that in many cases this is the bank that issues the card. With such an approach, an acquirer can differentiate their offering in the market and gain a competitive advantage.At an even more basic level, merchants that have agreements with multiple acquirers – including different POS devices – can choose which terminal to use based on the card presented by the customer. But such an approach is becoming less common as it’s not cost-efficient for any of the involved parties.4.Synergies could be the way forward for on-usFor many banks, issuing and acquiring are siloed. This does not have to be the case. Leveraging synergies in a common operational model will save costs and support the creation of new value-adding services for consumers and merchants who choose to participate in the network i.e., by creating a marketplace-like experience for customers. These could include merchant discounts, loyalty, and automatic installment contracts, among other things.Finally, is this the new future for on-usThere can be no denying that the importance of on us transaction is decreasing, while the importance of customer-centric value-adding services grows. And where does much of the value lie? In the data. If a bank can provide best-in-class acquiring and issuing, it should receive both data flows, which in turn can be used to create value-added services. Banks that have chosen to outsource acquiring will not be in the same favorable position.Today it’s no longer about card rails but rather about converging retail payment rails. This is the key to opening up a world of broad payment methods including open banking, instant payment wallets and whatever the future may bring.

A soft approach to hard facts – time to get ahead with an analytics strategy,/en/blog/2021/04/time-to-get-ahead-with-an-analytics-strategy/,Data / Mirva Toivonen / 20.4.2021,"Roughly speaking, an analytics strategy can be broken down into five main elements:data infrastructure
data strategy
data governance and data quality
supporting people and fostering skills
building individual analytics tools and solutions.Usually, leveraging data and analytics has top management support – after all, which C-level manager would say no to the opportunity to increase revenue or optimize processes?However, the cultural shift required to implement an analytics strategy can lead to challenges.This is where the softer aspects of an analytics strategy come into play – the ones that are more difficult to implement and measure, such as initiating a significant change process and building a business culture that is favorable to analytics.Winning hearts and minds: time to break the data silosWithout a change in corporate culture, analytics will remain siloed in individual projects, killing off the prospect of any gain in competitive advantage. The purpose of an analytics-friendly corporate culture is to help create a sustainable competitive advantage by changing the way people in a company think and act.However, there are a few common challenges on the journey to sustainable change.Analytics is about identifying and solving pain points in business processes, which requires a deep business understanding and the ability to identify where analytics can be utilized. Usually, data does exist but there is no clear way to use it for business development. For example, it may be unclear to a company what information it holds about customers and their service experiences and how this information could be systematically collected and combined so that it can be used to build stronger customer relationships.Common reasons for this usually include a lack of resources for data-utilization projects, data literacy not yet being perceived as part of business expertise, or people being unfamiliar with analytics tools.So how do you make sure your grand plans for an analytics strategy are brought to life rather than merely existing on paper?5+1 tips for putting an analytics strategy into practiceImplementing and managing analytics requires a change process. Sustainable change is achieved through long-term work that begins with individual pilots and then evolves into a new way of acting and thinking.Here are some tips to help you implement a sustainable change process:1) Ensure top management support: Analytics should be represented in top management, have a strategy, and be measured in the same way as other assets, expenses, and strategic functions. Management should have a plan for how the change process will be carried out. Analytics is not an IT project or department – rather, analytics-based thinking and action is everyone's responsibility.2) Make sure you have the time and resources available: Good data products are needed. The data should be easy to find, in an understandable format, and possible to validate. Data and analytics should be available to everyone and implemented in cross-functional teams instead of in silos.3) Set out a clear shared vision: Ensure supervisors and project managers understand analytics and engage them in leveraging analytics. Start with identifying some clear goals. Do you want to use the data to a) prioritize tasks, b) increase revenue, c) improve customer satisfaction, or d) something else? And do you know how analytics can help you achieve your goal(s)?4) Collect data and perform experiments: Building a business culture that is favorable to analytics begins with individual experiments and data collection. Individual experiments provide concrete examples of what can be achieved with data and make it possible to learn from your mistakes. At this point, you may notice that the basics are not in place and need to be adjusted. Some experiments may result in new projects as people realize how the data can be utilized.5) Develop operations and share information: The company's operations and structures should already be starting to change. Operational systems and processes should systematically measure the right things. This means all analytics are put back into circulation transparently as a part of your processes instead of being stuck in spreadsheets on individual hard drives. Development should not be done in silos but across the entire organization. If one part of the organization is more advanced in utilizing data, people should be transferred from there to other units to share their knowledge and information.+1) Renew and constantly innovate: Technology and analytics are evolving rapidly, so constant renewal is essential. Leveraging the expertise and vision of outside partners will help you to address this need. If projects do utilize partners, make sure that information and know-how are shared with everyone involved in the project.Cultural change requires investment, staff training, and pilot projects in which information and learnings are shared across the organization.The goal is to make the utilization of analytics follow a new, systematic development process.As Mike Grigsby says in his book Marketing Analytics: A practical guide to real marketing science: ""Analytics without application to an actionable strategy is meaningless, much like special effects in a movie without a plot.""Photo by John Ruddock on Unsplash Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal City, United States.

The benefits of investing in a managed service for financial crime prevention,/en/blog/2021/04/The-benefits-of-investing-in-a-managed-service-for-financial-crime-prevention/,Cybersecurity insights / Gunnar Koren / 19.4.2021,"Why should banks consider investing in a managed service for financial crime prevention? Because it will provide them with operational efficiency, reduced costs, effective end-customer interactions, fewer false positives, and shared costs on compliance and technological development.TietoEVRY’s calculations suggest that implementing a managed service for monitoring payment card transactions and accounts can potentially save customers between 25% and 60% in operational costs. Moreover, utilising a utility setup on transaction monitoring enables TietoEVRY to detect fraud faster, protecting payment service users and organisations from criminal activity more efficiently.Training and retaining a highly skilled and efficient workforce to fight financial crime is difficult and expensive. At the same time, technical developments and regulatory changes are creating a growing need for companies to have in-house competencies on all levels within their organisation. Companies are therefore sweeping the labour market to find talented employees with the right levels of technical and regulatory expertise. This in turn is driving costs and increasing the need for resource management.Alternative to high running costs and heavy technology investmentsAt TietoEVRY we offer an alternative to high running costs and heavy technology investments. Thanks to our long experience in running financial crime prevention operations for our customers, we have created an optimal setup for leveraging the latest technology in line with regulatory demands. Combining different transaction types in a multi-tenant monitoring utility, we can detect patterns at entity and network level creates opportunities to share threat patterns across our customers’ risk exposure. Highly trained analysts are working 24/7 on monitoring emerging risk patterns with the help of machine learning algorithms and AI. As soon as the system flags or stops a specific transaction, we notify your end client.Close to one hundred satisfied customers are already enjoying the lowest basis points in the market, monitoring and reporting in compliance with PSD2, and saving millions of Euros each year through our service. As an example, our Blocking of Rogue Merchants service stops thousands of transactions each week, protecting end customers from fraud and saving organisations hundreds of hours spent on chargebacks and disputes.Trust us with your financial crime prevention needsIf you want to free up your resources so that you can concentrate on your core business, innovation and value-creating activities, onboard to our financial crime prevention managed service.

Would you rather navigate your career with outdated or updated skills?,/en/blog/2021/04/would-you-rather-navigate-your-career-with-outdated-or-updated-skills/,Cloud / Katarina Engblom / 15.4.2021,"Inspired by the presentation, I started studying sports psychology in my spare time, with the aim to draw a new perspective on my work. Upgrading skills is largely about identifying and seizing the development opportunity when it arises.Seize the opportunity for learningToday, I can’t really rely on my master’s degree from two decades ago anymore, and I shouldn’t. In the same way as maps of cities or countries become obsolete as areas develop, the same way our skills become outdated as the world changes. Old maps – or degrees – make it difficult to navigate in cities, the world or work today.Therefore, maps and skills need to be regularly refreshed, updated, and broadened. TietoEVRY is running a massive training program to encourage 3,000 of their experts get certified in Azure cloud technologies. For a large company, this is an ambitious goal, but great ambition also generates great results for the business, customers, and people. By encouraging and inviting people for skills development,1. The company will strengthen its capital.2. Customers get more value and cool stuff.3. People create growth capital, inspiration, and energy for themselves.At TietoEVRY, every certified Azure professional will gain knowledge and expertise that will allow them to do their work in a more advanced, more enthusiastic, and pioneer-like way. Additionally, they will get a proof about their new skills. Browsing Twitter or completing a certificate are two completely different ways to develop skills.You might ask ‘how’Lifelong learning comes often with a lifelong question: how to make time for learning. I believe we all need to find our own unique answer to that question. To me, it comes down to a decision to prioritize: decide what is important, find time for it, and let nothing intervene or stop you from using that time for learning. It might mean a day off to study sports psychology or an hour blocked in the middle of the day to read the latest in technology.When I look back on the early years of my career, I feel that everything has changed: ways of working, customer challenges and opportunities, culture and values at work, leadership, technology. Today, I would not survive with the skills I had in my 20s. Luckily, I do not need to. I have had and seized opportunities to update, grow and renew my skills along the way.When you are offered an opportunity to develop your skills, it is worth taking it. When you get inspired to learn something new in any area of work or life, it's worth using that inspiration for learning. As individuals, communities, and businesses, we constantly need to update our maps to best navigate in this ever-evolving world.Microsoft Azure trainings benefit both our professionals and customers", Katarina Engblom ,Cloud , 15.4.2021
Master the terms of digital development with our DevOps and Agile glossary,/en/blog/2021/04/master-the-terms-of-digital-development-with-our-agile-and-devops-glossary/,Digitalization / Hans Kristian Flaatten / 15.4.2021,"Many of the everyday terms have an established meaning in the agile and DevOps context. To help you out, we put together a DevOps glossary.Master these terms with our DevOps and Agile glossary:AgileAgile refers to the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. The key argument is continuous collaboration with customers and constantly delivering well-working software in small iterations and getting feedback from the end-users instead of relying on bureaucratic processes.Application platformAn application platform is a high-level platform to enable and support application teams in running their applications. In the DevOps context, the aim is to have self-service and API-driven application platforms that are often built on top of cloud services.Application teamAn application team is an end-to-end responsible team for planning, designing, implementing, building, maintaining and supporting specific applications.""As code""""The term “as-code” is an approach and practice where items other than source code are treated as source code and with equal importance. Typical areas/items could be configuration and infrastructure-related artefacts.In practice, this means that you apply the same processes and best practices that are used for software development on these items.The final goal in treating items as code is to secure and raise the quality to a level where the items can be used effectively in automation and replace manual work.In DevOps, “as code” is an important concept, because it lets developers and teams take full responsibility for application and systems/tools used in the software development lifecycle. When breaking down silos between development and operations, this is an important technique that allows the team to work independently without the need for handovers.Canary deploymentCanary deployment is a deployment strategy aiming to reduce the impact of failures when bringing an application update to production. An updated version of the application is brought up alongside the existing one, and user traffic is gradually shifted over to the updated version. If any anomalies arise, traffic shifting is halted, and can easily be diverted back to the previous version, which is still running. Thus, returning to a “known good state” and having minimal or no impact on user experience.Chaos EngineeringChaos Engineering is a method also known as chaos experiments. Chaos Engineering is a disciplined approach for identifying potential failures before they become outages. This is commonly done by actively introducing failures in the system and making sure the system can automatically alleviate or correct the failures without service disruption. Some tools in this area are Chaos Monkey, Gremlin and Litmus.Chaos engineering is an example of ""right shifting the testing"" (along with e.g. A/B testing), i.e. moving/extending parts of testing to a production environment.Cloud-nativeCloud-native is an approach where you adapt the principles and delivery model that cloud computing provides. A cloud-native application is built for the cloud and utilises cloud-native technologies. Cloud-native technologies empower organisations to work according to DevOps principles, carry out continuous deployments to production, use microservices oriented architecture design, and embrace containers or higher-level runtimes and managed services (SaaS). In combination, these enable bringing new ideas to market faster and meeting customer demands sooner.Complicated-subsystem teamComplicated-subsystem team is a term introduced by Team Topologies. It refers to one of four fundamental team types, where significant mathematics/calculation/technical expertise is needed. Read more about Team Topologies.Configuration as codeConfiguration as code is an approach and practice where configuration items are treated as source code and with equal importance (see “as code” definition).Configuration items are defined as something used to change the behaviour of an existing application, tool or infrastructure component.By introducing the “as code” concept configuration will become stable, its quality will improve and it can be used to automate activities and processes. Introducing guardrails, processes, tests and automation will increase collaboration and responsibility for configuration items.ContainerisationContainerisation is the act of bundling your application together with all its runtime dependencies like tools, operating system and libraries. Containers have become the standard for building and running modern applications. Containers can be used effectively when building a continuous delivery pipeline.Containers as a ServiceContainers as a Service is a managed service to run containerised applications where the orchestration is taken care of and all you as a user need to be concerned about is your application as a container. CaaS is a specialised type of Platform as a Service (PaaS).Continuous DeliveryContinuous Delivery (CD) is a software development practice where an application is kept in a deployable state all the time. This means for example that code, configurations and other artefacts needed for deployment are delivered together, and the continuous delivery pipeline deploys and verifies that the application is kept in a deployable state.Continuous Delivery benefits include real-time production readiness, as well as reduced production deployment risk and time to repair.Continuous DeploymentContinuous Deployment is a release strategy where changes are automatically deployed to a production environment if verified successfully through the pipeline. Continuous Deployment enables multiple deployments to production each day, empowering the organisation to quickly deliver new features to the end-users. Since the application can be deployed several times per day, it also makes the application progress more tangible and enables quick user feedback on changes.In practice, to achieve Continuous Deployment, organisations need to have Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery practices in place.Continuous feedbackContinuous feedback is an essential component of the DevOps way of working. The development team works closely with customers and end-users to get their feedback on the product. The actual user feedback is a source for further tasks and prioritisation. The user feedback is augmented with feedback obtained from monitoring the system behaviour in production, and with other immediate feedback during development time, such as testing and monitoring results from system testing. It is also normal to get feedback on processes by measuring different aspects of them.Continuous improvementContinuous improvement is one of the essential practices in the DevOps way of working. In an everchanging world, the common expectation is that quality, speed and efficiency should improve. Organisations and teams continuously need to improve their way of working and adapt to changing requirements. Having a continuous improvement mindset and realising improvements is a team responsibility that requires a change in thinking and acting.Continuous integrationContinuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers commit and merge their changes to mainline frequently, leading to multiple integrations per day. After commit/merge an automated pipeline builds and verifies the changes. The key goal of continuous integration is to secure the quality of the code and enable collaboration and transparency.CI/CD serverCI/CD server refers to a tool that is responsible for the pipeline logic. The tool acts on events and triggers a chain of actions to drive the Delivery Pipeline. A good Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment server enables integration with a variety of tools. It acts on events and supports scheduling, monitoring and visualisation. One of the most popular CI/CD servers is the open-source tool Jenkins, thanks to the large community that develop plugins to support different tools, scenarios and use cases. The packaged solutions like GitLab, Azure DevOps, and GitHub also have their integrated CI/CD servers.Continuous learning cultureContinuous learning culture refers to continually increasing knowledge, competence, and performance by becoming a learning organisation committed to relentless improvement and innovation. For example, SAFe defines a continuous learning culture here.Cross-functional teamA cross-functional team is the industry term for a team with all the competency required to design, implement, test, deliver, operate and monitor a service or product. The team can be e.g. an Application Team, a Feature Team or a DevOps Team. Read more about Team Topologies.DevOpsDevOps is the cultural movement of breaking down silos between developers and operators bringing them together and making them responsible for the entire life cycle of applications. This is aided by automated tools to deliver and monitor applications.DevOps pipelineDevOps pipeline is the mechanism supporting DevOps best practices like Automation, Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, test automation, predictive monitoring and feedback loops. The pipeline provides agile teams with a paved way, so they can become effective DevOps teams.DevXOpsDevXOps has been introduced as DevOps has become a more common and better-understood approach having an emergence of variations with a particular focus, like DevSecOps with focus on security, DevTestOps with focus on testing and DevBizOps with focus on business value creation. All these focus areas are essentially always present in the DevOps approach, only the focus varies. DevXOps is used to describe any such focus area.Distributed tracingDistributed tracing is technology aiming to ensure application observability, traceability and monitoring. It has become popular in microservices oriented application architectures. It enables tracing the long chain of requests between different services over the network. Standards like Open Telemetry define that a standardised trace is emitted and stored in a centralised location in the sequence.Enabling teamEnabling team is one of the four fundamental team types according to Team Topologies. An enabling team helps a stream-aligned team to overcome obstacles and detect missing capabilities. Read more about Team Topologies.Feature flagsFeature flags or feature toggling is a software development technique to minimise deployment-related risks. It allows a developer to hide functionality and provide “a dark launch” where a new feature is deployed to production but hidden from users. Once the new version runs reliably the new functionality can be enabled for selected users and gradually rolled out to the entire userbase. If the new feature causes problems or does not work as expected, it can simply be disabled without changing the code or re-deploying the application.Functions as a ServiceFunctions as a Service (FaaS) provides services for operating and triggering independent functions. The services aim to empower developers to run self-contained functions triggered by external events. The benefits are scalability from zero to thousands. Applications built on FaaS are comprised of a set of functions that are run and triggered independently of each other, but together are (or are part of) a complete system.Immutable infrastructureImmutable infrastructure is the practice of creating new resources with the latest version or configuration. Instead of modifying an existing server or application, you create a new one and shift traffic over to the new instance. The key benefit is avoiding potential unplanned service interruptions. This practice is very well suited for cloud-based environments in Infrastructure as Code or Configuration as Code approaches. One common configuration is where file systems are mounted read-only, both to avoid configuration drift and reduce the impact of security breaches.Infrastructure as codeInfrastructure as code is an approach and practice where infrastructure items are treated as source code and with equal importance (see “as code” definition). Modern infrastructure services are self-serviced and API (Application Program Interface) driven. This means that instead of clicking through a graphical user interface you can start programming the infrastructure to increase speed, reduce errors and ensure parity between environments.Infrastructure items are defined as scripts, definitions, and templates used to create and set up infrastructure components like tools, virtual machines, networks, storage, etc. In DevOps, this is an important technique since it enables teams to take responsibility and ownership of infrastructure, remove the handover to an operations team and evolve infrastructure according to the innovation pace of the application itself.JenkinsJenkins is a DevOps pipeline automation server that is the most commonly used general-purpose CI/CD workflow tool today. Read more about Jenkins.JiraJira is software that helps to plan, track, and manage agile software development projects. It is developed by Atlassian. Many popular extensions exist to aid teams in different techniques and technologies. Read more about Jira.KubernetesKubernetes is a container orchestrator. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerised workloads. Kubernetes is available on all cloud and infrastructure providers, Windows, Linux and Mac to IoT. Read more about Kubernetes.Low-codeLow-code is an approach to software development where the developers create software through modelling, instead of traditional computer programming. A development platform and software provides developers an environment with graphical interfaces and configuration management. Low-code platforms also contain software development automation features. Thanks to its visual layout, set of components and minimal hand-coding required, Low-code speeds up the process of application creation.MicroservicesMicroservices is an application architecture style aiming to design systems of loosely coupled and independent services that can be built and maintained by separate teams. The key is that each microservice is scoped to handle only one single responsibility.Microservices simplify the implementation of continuous delivery and deployment.Monitoring is the principle of gathering data from running applications, supporting services and infrastructure. This enables insights and visibility into the application and runtime environment behaviour. Monitoring can also trigger alerts on application health. It also speeds up debugging errors and finding root problems.NoOpsNoOps (no operations) is a concept aiming for IT environments that are so automated and abstracted from the underlying infrastructure that there is no need for a dedicated team to manage the IT operations environment.ObservabilityObservability is the engineering practice of making the inner workings of an application visible from the outside by building it in from the start as opposed to adding it as an after-thought at the end. The goal is to answer one crucial question: ""is the application working as expected?"" and catching problems before the customers start noticing them. We typically say that Logging, Metrics and Distributed Tracing are the three core pillars of observability.Pipeline managementPipeline management refers to the activities that are needed to keep the DevOps pipeline running optimally and stay optimally fit for the team(s) that are using it. Pipeline management covers following the load, identifying bottlenecks, and correcting any shortcomings. It can also include further development of the pipeline based on the needs. There can be a separate team providing these services either permanently (Pipeline as a Service) or temporarily, or the team can handle this themselves.Platform as a ServicePlatform as a Service (PaaS) is a compute paradigm put forward by Heroku and since adopted by all the major cloud providers. You as a developer are only responsible for the application code and deploy that to the PaaS service to run. You don't need to worry about maintaining the underlying infrastructure and runtime. PaaS can be a great option for the right application, but can also result in inflexible and expensive solutions when it is not a good fit for the architecture. When planning the architecture, costs need to be considered as part of the design to create a good result.Platform teamPlatform team is one of the four fundamental team types according to Team Topologies. Platform team is a grouping of other team types that provide a compelling internal product to accelerate delivery by Stream-aligned teams.

The policies could be anything as disperse as access policies in databases to resource management in cloud environments. By representing policies as code in text files, proven software development best practices can be adopted such as version control, automated testing and automated deployment.Policy as code makes it possible to automatically apply and enforce the policy, enabling benefits such as having defined one single policy which is then applied to many different systems increasing the consistency across a wide set of services. This makes it easier to maintain and change the policy. To achieve this, you need a configuration language to describe the policy and a way of applying the policy to the target services. An example of policy as code is the Open Policy Agent Framework.Quality gateQuality gate is a checkpoint between different stages in a software development process. A predefined set of criteria define if the process can proceed to the next stage.Quality gates are designed to give fast feedback to stakeholders and secure quality. They also reduce waste in the organisation since they stop the process if criteria are not met.An example of quality gates could be the commit gate, this gate contains criteria that new code needs to fulfil, for example passing unit tests, or passing Sonarqube. Smoke test is another example of the quality gate, if new changes don’t pass through smoke tests there is no point deploying that change to higher-level test environments.RadiatorRadiator is a concept where radiators are visualising real-time status from the delivery pipeline and development lifecycle. Information presented on a radiator is suitable to present on screens in a team room. Radiators aggregate information from multiple sources and present it to stakeholders, this reduces the need for users to go into multiple sources to understand the real-time status during the development lifecycle. Radiators are used to create a fast feedback loop that is a vital part of DevOps.Release automationRelease automation refers to automating activities of Release management. The most common and simplest automation is automating the deployment of the package to production and composing the accompanying release documentation automatically. This may be extended by for instance automating post-deployment testing, automatic update of the configuration management database and automating the composition of the release package.Release managementRelease management refers to overseeing a software release within an organisation, including planning, scheduling, composing, testing, and deploying the software package. The aim is to ensure that the expected contents are the expected quality and they are made available to the users at the expected time.Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is a framework for scaling Agile. SAFe is designed to help businesses continuously and more efficiently deliver value on a regular and predictable schedule. It provides a knowledge base of proven, integrated principles and practices to support enterprise agility.One of the most important key success factors in a Lean-Agile transformation is leadership engagement combined with education and training.ServerlessServerless is a paradigm where an application developer does not have to care about the underlying (virtual) servers – they are completely managed. Typically, via a consumption-based model, you only pay for the actual usage. No up-front commitment is needed. If the application is not used, you don’t pay for anything. Serverless is often used in conjunction with FaaS and SaaS services.Service Level Indicators (SLI)Service Level Indicators (SLI) is a specific metric of the application that directly corresponds to the satisfaction of a typical user of the application. SLIs are used to build targets (SLO) for the level of reliability one aims to achieve and is a core part of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). Good examples for SLI is the percentage of all HTTP requests that results in an error page or the 99th percentile of the time it takes to respond to HTTP requests.Service Level Objectives (SLO)Service Level Objectives (SLO) are the goals for the level of reliability one wants to achieve over a certain time (often measured over the last 28 days). SLOs are used to adjust priorities for development teams when they need to focus more on reliability or if they are achieving the required reliability to develop new features.Service virtualisationService virtualisation is an approach where impediments caused by dependencies between software components are alleviated through well-defined interfaces and virtual implementations of those interfaces (stubs, virtual services). The virtual implementation typically returns some simple valid answer for the interface call, which thus allows for the development of other dependent components before the actual implementation is available. Also commonly referred to as mocking a service.Shift leftShift left refers to moving activity to an earlier stage in the software engineering process. For example, shift left testing refers to moving test activities earlier in the software engineering lifecycle. This may involve e.g. writing end-user tests following behaviour-driven development to enable end-to-end testing afterwards.Shift rightShift right refers to moving some part of the process to a later stage in the software engineering process. For example, shift right testing refers to moving part of testing to a production environment. This may involve practices such as chaos engineering and A/B testing.Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is the practice of running modern and complex applications in production by balancing new features and stability with agreed-upon metrics (SLO). SRE differs from traditional operations by being a part of the application team and sharing the responsibility. Usually, SRE has a strong system internals and network (shared infrastructure) competence with a specific focus on building reliability to the application.Stream-aligned teamA stream-aligned team is one of four fundamental team types according to Team Topologies. A stream-aligned team is aligned to a flow of work from (usually) a segment of the business domain. Read more about Team Topologies.System TeamA System Team is a type of Enabling team. The System Team is a specialised Agile Team that assists in building and supporting the Agile development environment, typically including development and maintenance of the toolchain that supports the Continuous Delivery Pipeline. The System Team also supports and educates the Stream-aligned Teams with e.g. DevOps implementation, WoW, automated builds and testing.Team TopologiesTeam Topologies is a framework for “Organising business and technology teams for fast flow” defined by Skelton and Pais. Key concepts include 4 types of topologies and 3 core interaction modes. Team Topologies aim to minimise required interactions and costly handovers, stabilise individual trust levels, increase the flow of deliveries and create high-performing teams. Read more about Team Topologies.Test automationTest automation refers to the execution of software tests with the use of dedicated tools or scripts.Test data managementTest data management is the process of creating and maintaining data for testing purposes. Typically test data is used in non-production environments only, but it can also include production environments. Test data can be synthetic (created from scratch) or anonymised or pseudonymised from production environment data. Test data management is also needed because of regulator laws such as GDPR for personal data.Test data needs to be managed in the same way as test environments, see Test environment management.Test environment managementTest environment management is a process of creating and maintaining non-production environments for development purposes. The aim is to ensure that test environments are at the expected state when tests are run, so that test results accurately reflect the quality of the test subject. This is especially important with automated tests, which typically lead to a situation where the environments need to be continuously in a valid state. An easy way to achieve this is to create the environments dynamically through the infrastructure as code approach and containerisation so that the environment exists only during the test execution.Value stream mappingValue stream mapping allows you to create a visual representation of the activities in a value stream, organised into sequences of steps. Each step is analysed for its characteristics like the value it generates, the time delay it introduces and the effort it requires.Value stream mapping improves your understanding of the value stream dynamics. It can be used for improving the value stream process by e.g. identifying and removing wasteful activities and reducing process cycle times.Want to stay up-to-date?Follow the authors on LinkedIn, Hans Kristian Flaatten, Nicklas Hilmersson, Bjørge Solli and Tapani Tirkkonen.", Hans Kristian Flaatten ,Digitalization , 15.4.2021
Agility will be key for acquirers as they meet merchants needs for new instruments,/en/blog/2021/04/agility-will-be-key-for-acquirers-as-they-meet-merchants-needs-for-new-instruments/,Digitalization / Toms  Jansons / 15.4.2021,"The need for flexibilityMerchants should be equipped to handle all payment methods – which requires integrations with different APIs across a complex network. Simplicity for merchants has to be key, i.e., handling everything for them except the end payment step. Those banks that provide a one-stop solution will be the number one choice of merchants. For acquirers it means being adaptive to the future payment methods – a flexible payment platform is imperative.Multiple payment methodsAs we know, today, many customers still pay with cards. Tomorrow, the same customers may want to pay with Apple Pay, Garmin Pay and a card, or another wallet, such as Swish, Vipps or any other payment method, based on cards or instant payments. Not surprisingly, this can be confusing for merchants. As an acquirer, it’s vital to provide a multitude of payments in a straightforward way so that merchants can service their customers. This means providing easy integration and holistic views of merchant transactions, among other things.Stepwise roll-outFrom what we have seen so far, we expect that most merchants will want a stepwise rollout of alternative payment methods – rather than pushing out all the potential capabilities at once. So, what might a flexible service platform look like that could support this through the addition of new payment schemes over time?We believe a hybrid model at the core would be the ideal option. It would be a single platform with dual rails, i.e., account-based and card-based payments. This would enable a system to be built that could support instant payments as an extra layer to the cards platform.What does this mean for an acquirer?To take full advantage of this you need to think about building new products on a new platform. Essentially, transitioning stepwise from an existing cards platform to a modern ‘all payment’ platform. And, when you do this, it’s best to choose a vendor that has extensive experience and a modular platform solution. Of course, transitioning to a modern platform offers many additional benefits, such as lower maintenance requirements, a modern product offering, automated reporting tools, advanced fraud management, and effective settlement.Key considerationsThere are however a number of key considerations that should be taken into when processing account-based payments:Certain fees can be calculated and passed on to merchants. Typically, merchant service charges tend to be based on turnover and include services such as sending messages, among other things.
Even though account-based payments could be based on instant payment rails, meaning merchants’ accounts should be instantly credited, this is not always the case. In some instances, i.e., for high risks merchants, a bank may want to do a risk assessment before transactions are credited.
It may even be necessary to keep a deposit from a merchant as collateral. This amount could change based on the actual turnover of the merchant – similar to the way it’s done with cards.
Not all the merchants will be willing to accept every transaction being credited separately to an account – particularly large merchants with thousands of transactions per day. One solution would be for an acquirer to accumulate transactions and credit a merchant’s account in bulk amounts with detailed reporting. Obviously, the frequency of payments would have to be agreed upon with the merchant.
Risk and fraud monitoring. This should not be limited to the moment when funds are received but also be done when merchants generate, for example, an RtP message. This would mean checking that amounts are in line with a merchant’s business.Finally…We believe that a stepwise approach is the best way forward for acquirers. By that, we mean old services can be kept on an older platform initially, while new solutions should be built on a new platform. These can run in parallel until the time is right to transition all services to the new platform and retire the old one.It’s also important to consider that there are multiple similarities between account-based payments processing and card transactions. Therefore, working with a vendor who has vast experience in both of these areas, will mean you can take advantage of this expertise.Related blogs:The Fintech dilemma: how to evaluate and collaborate to bring added value to the cards businessTokenization: the secure way to support merchants, consumers and IoT paymentsDo you find card authentication a headache?

Is Open Radio Access Networks a revolution for the wireless industry?,/en/blog/2021/04/is-open-radio-access-networks-a-revolution-for-the-wireless-industry/,Digitalization / Mats  Eriksson / 14.4.2021,"As the society at large is facing a massive rollout of 5G technologies that are supposed to enable a ubiquitous and everything connected world, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are concerned about the cost and performance of those networks. But further, they are also concerned about the ability to create new services and business based on 5G as such, in combination with edge computing.Key considerations of the Open RAN technologySo, what are the key considerations of the Open RAN technology? Here I lift out two top ones. For more details, please study the white paper: Is Open RAN the silver-bullet for the wireless industry?1. Performance optimizations are needed to turn available SW stacks into productsAs the amount of data transported in networks surge, the need for efficient data transport is imminent. Communication Service Providers (CSPs) are cautious about the power consumed by transporting data. There are huge differences among vendors coming from efficient algorithms as well as efficient implementation of the real-time critical workloads. Making maximum use of spectrum through technologies, such as Massive MIMO, require substantial optimization of emerging software stacks.2. Multi-vendor integration remains a key challenge that requires substantial domain knowledge and skillsOpen RAN promises to enable mix and match of the different parts of the RAN solution. Yet, some of the key interfaces are highly complex and require high performance. Therefore, resulting in that integration remains to be the key challenge and requires cross-domain technical skills. MNOs needs further to consider their role and vendor independence in such an integration process.Want to explore RAN evolution?We at TietoEVRY have a long track record with companies helping them to find their RAN path: adding features, optimizing & hardening virtualized RAN solutions and purpose-built products.Have you already found your path forward?

Time for software-driven transformation in the financial services industry,/en/blog/2021/04/time-for-software-driven-transformation-in-the-financial-services-industry/,/ Christian Segersven / 13.4.2021,"Christian Segersven, Head of TietoEVRY Financial Services Solutions, takes a closer look.The driving force behind changeWe’re all aware of the increasing impact digitalization is having on our lives and the business and industrial world – not least the banking and financial sector. Something that has been further accelerated by the pandemic and the resulting reliance on digital services.In the past, innovation in the financial sector was driven by advances in hardware. That has changed now, software is driving innovation, while hardware is becoming increasingly commoditized. It’s now up to individual organizations to embrace this before their competitors.Those that do, will be able to get new compelling services out to the market faster, responding to new market demands and improving the customer experience, while reducing resource requirements and time-to-value. Those that don’t, will get left behind; caught in the grip of clunky and resource-heavy legacy systems.Time for real-timeIf software – and software-as-a-service – is the key to innovation and transformation, secure real-time transactions are one of the foundations that financial services should be built around. These must, of course, run smoothly, despite ever-increasing pressure from regulators and central banks, increasing fraudulent activities and the need to reduce costs.A new organization for a new dynamic marketWhich brings us to TietoEVRY Financial services solutions and what we have done in the past year (and continue to do as we speak).

Best practice Workday to SAP integration,/en/blog/2021/04/best-practice-workday-to-SAP-integration/,Digitalization / Marko Nissinen / 9.4.2021,"It is important to make correct decisions about dataWhen tackling this issue, many technical questions are raised and solved. This however is not the only key to build a successful SAP Integration from Workday. Workday implementations are often short compared to those dedicated to on-premise solutions. SAP Integration however will require time for preparation works before the integration build can start. To have the integration ready on time, it would be advantageous to even start discussing and designing it before the Workday projects begin. Early design discussions allow critical topics to be explored and possible gaps identified before the build commences.For example, it might sound like a good idea to have scheduled weekly hours in Workday, as it is needed for reporting, but leave information about work shifts in the payroll system. However, be aware that SAP infotype requires both scheduled weekly hours and work shifts information, and unnecessary complications are created by splitting the infotype between two systems.Scope should also be discussed. Of particular interest should be how to handle rescinds and corrections. A top-down view, the “big picture” discussion can also drive decisions and should be taken early in the project - what needs to flow to SAP and what needs to flow back from it. Once you understand your scope and requirements, review possible ready-made connectors by SAP vendors. This can speed up the project significantly.Collect the correct expertsSo, who should be participating the early design discussions? Firstly, the data model must be discussed and agreed. In short, what do we need to maintain, where, and why.As a result, you should surface what the integration must control, what will need to be actioned manually, and perhaps most importantly, what can be dropped completely. Or, should our integration raise a warning, that manual handling is needed in some specific cases etc.Here we need someone who can comment from the business side and understands SAP as well, to act as the SAP Expert. If payroll is in scope, we also need a Workday Compensation specialist that can either advise on Workday HCM Core too, or we will also need a Workday HCM Core specialist.Ensure we reserve the resources on time. It is not enough to hire a “Workday Integration Guru”, we will need to gather people with crucial skills: SAP ABAP programming, SAP Payroll or SAP ERP knowledge, and Workday’s integration technologies. These people must be managed by a skillful Project Manager who is aware of the complicated nature of SAP Integrations.Time to buildSo, we have made our design, everyone agrees on data model, and we are ready to start with the integration design. How should we proceed? Based on many years of experience with such integration builds, my suggested best approach is to use Workday standard integration technologies like Payroll Effective Change Integration (PECI). Transformation should then be functioned by SAP, since Workday is not able to understand specific SAP logic, which can become a showstopper eventually. For example, Workday cannot easily replicate closing records for iDocs.If for some reason we cannot use SAP for our transformational needs, we should carefully consider our resources. SAP Integration requires a lot of “if-then-else” logic, many different types of effective date, and very complex mappings. Additionally, whoever is going to own the transformation requirements, and ensure these are delivered, must understand the underlying business needs in different scenarios. Use the best-fit resources, and make sure they are the people that will execute the transformation.Document and test!Additionally, everything should be documented carefully and clearly. The integration will have very complex mappings, business logics and typically, maintenance will be difficult. By documenting thoroughly and clearly we make life in production much easier.Besides high-quality documentation, these integrations must be tested in detail. Go through all different business scenarios including standard “business as usual” and exceptional use case scenarios. For example, a worker having a transfer and long-term absence simultaneously. Don’t just focus on one scenario at a time. Remember to test end to end critical processes including how these behave in SAP. Remember also to think about how to handle scenarios which are not in the integration scope.Interested in finding out more?

Do you have what it takes to be an EPI front-runner?,/en/blog/2021/04/do-you-have-what-it-takes-to-be-an-epi-front-runner/,Digitalization / Edgars Bremze  / 8.4.2021,"The need for standardizationThe EU made it clear that it was going to push for a standardized payment scheme to open up the market for consumers and businesses – as it’s currently dominated by large, mainly non-European actors. As a result, 16 major banks from Belgium, France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, launched an initiative to deliver this. The key drivers for EPI include:Lowering and standardizing transaction costs, no longer having to rely on the infrastructure of international card schemes
Supporting local controls by maintaining the independence of national payment systems – additional charges from international card schemes will be removed from local, low-cost products such as cards for the unbanked, state compensations and benefits.
Promoting open banking, with a standardized, independent payment platform it will be much easier to develop and utilize new technologies.EPI-ready platformOf course, this won’t happen automatically with the launch of EPI. It will be up to individual banks to define their market and card scheme strategies – and this is just one area where we can help you. Our experience in cards, payments, and open banking – the same areas covered in EPI – may also be a big help.Key considerationsAssuming EPI is launched as planned in 2022, we anticipate the marketplace will be impacted by several key considerations. These include:European open standard – with the right platform to support this it will be much easier for actors to integrate their system and take full advantage of the new marketplace.
ISO standards – the new ISO 20022 is much more data-rich and flexible than previous standards. The mix of traditional cards and ISO 20022 will facilitate new exciting product development around payments solutions.
New integration opportunities – cards with instant payments will open up the market. For instance, it will be possible to connect with different protocols at point-of-sale, however, this may require infrastructure investments.It’s time for your EPI RoadmapWith open banking growing throughout Europe, we firmly believe that you should now be developing your roadmap for managing the upcoming changes and opportunities. The legislation is already in place that supports the implementation of new technologies for smoother and faster integrations. If we look back at mobile phone payments it took users time to start using these services, so banks could afford to take their time with rollouts. This will not necessarily be repeated today with newer forms of payment – customer adoption is much faster than it used to be.In fact, you could argue that the user experience already exists in many countries – EPI will just trigger a broader expansion of these experiences by integrating Europe and SEPA payment services.Getting startedStart planning by mapping out what services will remain on old rails and what should be thought about in terms of new payment models. Review your services, look for the gaps that must be filled to fully utilize EPI. Don’t just look at your retail payment system in isolation from payments or APIs, think of them as a greater entity. Don’t forget, your customers will want a connected, fulfilling user experience.And finally…Look for an experienced partner that can help you navigate towards a cloud-ready system, that operates with open APIs, supports both ISO20022 and ISO8583 rails, and delivers customer-centric solutions.At TietoEVRY we help our customers build local card schemes and integrate them with international card schemes; implement national payment solutions on ISO20022 instant payment rails; provide SEPA and SEPA Instant connectivity for Nordic banks; and provide open API aggregation and PSD2 compliancy for EU banks. If these meet some of the requirements you have, we will be more than happy to discuss how we can help you.Related blogs:

Time to cooperate! How the municipality of Haninge keeps up the pace of digitalization,/en/blog/2021/04/time-to-cooperate-how-haninge-kommun-keeps-up-the-pace-of-digitalization/,Cybersecurity insights / Kristoffer Kullberg / 1.4.2021,"Hi Anna! How’s the working life going at Haninge Kommun?To be honest, it’s been a combination of nice and boring, but I believe I’ve finally found a good balance in my life where I choose to see the benefits of working from home. We have digital check-ins which certainly makes things easier, and we’re planning a digital workshop between different representatives from Haninge Kommun and TietoEVRY as we speak, which I believe will be very successful.What do you do at Haninge Kommun? What’s your background?I’ve worked at Haninge Kommun since 2015. My role covers a lot of areas, and as well as being the Administrative Manager, I’m also the Change Manager. This means that I look at proposed changes coming from ourselves or our partners and decide which ones work and which ones doesn’t. My background, however, is in the private sector, which I believe gives me the benefit of being able to apply learnings from completely different areas to the work I do at Haninge Kommun. First and foremost, it’s my job to ensure that our IT department delivers quality in everything that we do. This, in turn, creates a quality experience and service to our citizens. The expectations of deliverable results and areas of responsibility has certainly changed a great deal since I first started; nowadays the IT department is responsible for serving our whole department with everything from technical platforms, internal services, networks, telecom, core business applications, and much more. On top of this, it’s our job to make sure we keep every bit of information and data safe.What do you believe to be the main reason we see a big wave of digitalization in the public sector?It’s very important for all of us at Haninge Kommun to keep up with the pace of digitalization that’s sweeping across the society in general. We might not be at the forefront of digitalization, but we are becoming more digital than ever. As we recruit younger people, we see a gradual shift in how we look at digital services and how we approach digitalization in general. However, we’re not a private company, and we can’t simply decide to make all our services digital and demand that every user has a Mobile Bank ID-app installed and ready to go; we have to look to every individual need. My mother is a perfect example to illustrate this; she has no digital form of ID (nor does she want one). She is still as eligible as everyone else to receive the services we can offer her, regardless of how she comes to order them. To put in simply, it’s our job to create digital services for those who wants to use them, and it’s also out job to ensure that everyone can access the services they want and need; be it digitally or not.How has digitalizing services made life better for the citizens of Haninge Kommun?There are two main things we look at when it comes to digitalizing a service. Firstly, the aim is to save time for our citizens by making it easier for them to apply for and use of our services, combined with a bigger transparency in the process which means that you’re able to track your request online instead of having to make a call. Secondly, we’re aiming to offer a more standardized, safe service that reduces the amount of time spent on administration.How has the cooperation been between you and TietoEVRY?In my opinion, this is a very good cooperation. We have regular check-ins with Kristoffer (Kullberg, technical consultant at TietoEVRY), where several representatives from our side and TietoEVRY discuss what works, what doesn’t work and what we see happening in the future for us. For me, it’s the continuous communication that stands out the most – I feel perfectly safe knowing that I’m always able to pick up the phone for some quick advice or support if I should ever need it. We’re not just talking about reports or the daily IT-operations in our check-ins; we spend a lot of time to draw up ideas for the future and come up with new ideas together. It’s not always the case that we’re able to go from idea to reality, but by merely discussing these ideas, we’re spurred on to become even better at digitalization.It used to take up to two weeks for you to create a new digital identity, and now it takes but a few hours. How did you make that change?Me and Kristoffer at TietoEVRY talked for a long time about how we could improve the so-called identity portal, where the digital identities are being created. Thanks to a new script, we’re not risking that a returning employee receives the same access they had before. So not only does it take less time to create a new digital identity; the process is much safer than before. We’ve automated a lot of manual processes, meaning that employees receive the access they should have (no more, and no less), quicker than ever before. This is a fairly simple implementation, but it would never have been on the agenda if not for the great cooperation between our team and TietoEVRY, and the genuine dedication of everyone in the whole team contributing to improving our services.", Kristoffer Kullberg ,Cybersecurity insights , 1.4.2021
Retail Payments are Converging to Data-Rich Real-Time Payments,/en/blog/2021/03/retail-payments-are-converging-to-data-rich-real-time-payments/,Digitalization / Jarkko Turunen / 30.3.2021,"Nowhere is this more obvious than in China, India and Kenya, where the vast majority of the population used mobile wallets in the past year. In Europe, Sweden has the highest weekly user rate of mobile payment apps. Despite this, the majority of Swedes still use debit or credit cards issued by their banks to pay for goods. Hence, cards still play a major role.The Pandemic has contributed to the global increase in card usage, transitioning even more people away from using cash. This has been supported by the adoption of contactless payments, increased payment limits for contactless payments, and improved usability of cards via mobile card solutions like ApplePay and GooglePay.Creating value through real-time payments and cardsTraditional card payment rails were developed some decades ago. Not surprisingly, they don’t always support real-time fund transfers and contain a limited amount of transaction data. This causes payment delays for merchants and makes it difficult to automatically reconcile end-to-end payments, for instance, when booking credit card bills from abroad or reconciling partial e-commerce refunds. Clearly, there is added value in moving card payments to real-time payment rails.However, there are arguments for keeping traditional cards and card rails in place for both consumers and merchants. Not all consumers have adopted mobile phones as payment tools and many still use cards when shopping. In addition, cards are a proven technology, and they are less vulnerable to network connectivity issues or dying batteries.On the merchant side, there is a willingness to serve customers who don’t want to switch to mobile cards. In addition, existing POS terminals and partnerships with acquirers will ensure cards remain a viable alternative for a relatively long time.Can card and instant payment rails converge?We believe there is a need to combine cards and instant payments into a single, modern, real-time payment platform. Based on our international experience from implementing card solutions and delivering central instant payments infrastructures for banks, we have identified five consideration areas for a new, real-time payment infrastructureEnd-to-end solution: a platform should include payment initiation from cards and result in either a request to pay or a traditional card authorization that transfers payments and funds using real-time payment rails. This helps to connect to existing processes and behaviours.
Open architecture: the architecture should be based on open standards, open APIs and support different flows so that, for instance, POS terminals can utilize traditional technology or more modern APIs when they are upgraded.
Ecosystem setup: acquirers and processors are established in the cards ecosystem and should be linked to the new real-time payments ecosystem.
Governance: cards have traditional models for interchange fees, chargebacks, and currency exchange, among others. These should be considered in real-time payment governance models for card and wallet-initiated payments.
Brand: cards have traditionally been used to increase brand recognition. This will remain essential in the digital payments world where many brands and payment methods compete for attention.In conclusionIt’s exciting times in retail payments. Data-rich, real-time payments will bring considerable added value to consumers and merchants. New real-time payment systems should consider how current card payments volumes can be boosted through greater adoption. A concrete example of this convergence is the European Payments Initiative (EPI), which aims to offer new card rails and an e-wallet.At Tietoevry, we are working actively with central banks, peer organizations that are establishing real-time payment systems, and our banking clients that are connecting to these real-time payment rails.

Human experience is at the heart of customer experience and future business,/en/blog/2021/03/human-experience/,Meet our people / Marko Taali / 24.3.2021,"This is the question me and my CX team here at Tietoevry ponder every day as we work at the frontline of designing human experiences, for all sectors of society. For me, future business is about having the courage to act like human beings towards each other.This means that value creation in the digital era requires a fresh playbook. The new chapters of it are empathy and building human-sized cultures, where value matters more than systems. Because value is created by teams of people from potentially very different backgrounds, value creation can actually fuel the understanding of others.Customers, vendors, colleagues, and end-users are all human beings and pieces of the same puzzle. Therefore, I sometimes prefer the term human experience over customer experience.Enabling the business shiftInstead of only optimizing systems, future business is about nurturing living organisms – specifically, people working together towards their shared goals. In this scenario, human insight is key to the necessary change. Psychological safety releases the superpowers of questioning, rethinking, and genuine co-operation. Therefore, making people feel comfortable, confident and accepted as they are always precedes jumping into the business case itself in our Customer Experience projects.As I see it, carrying the torch of humanity both in customer cases and in building our company culture is the task of Tietoevry’s CX professionals. This makes me feel both humble and proud – being “people first” means that we make meaningful products and services.The last three years here have given me the opportunity to take a more holistic view and have a greater impact on the customer experience than ever before. I have learned a lot from my skilled and visionary customers and colleagues as discussions shake apart the silos separating businesses and fields of science. Instead of making loose arguments, one needs to understand the whole picture.In my career, the best outcomes have always resulted from long-term customer relationships. Businesses do not change by magic, but on a project-by-project basis through the lessons shared and results gained. Therefore, CX professionals need to be determined, co-operative, and patient. In short, they need to keep the faith that shared stories and the shared strategy of providing human value will ultimately make the difference.Having a positive challenging attitudeOne key strength of our CX team is our courage to positively challenge current practices. CX professionals face conflicts between what is easy to do and what is valuable for customers and end-users. You may be asked to fix a superficial problem like the appearance of a user interface, even though you see the real problem lies deeper within the processes.These are what we call the wicked problems of design. Of course, we need to face reality and meet budgets, but we cannot forget the human aspect. Keeping the human in mind prevents us from solving problems that never even existed or that were not part of the business case in the first place!I have enjoyed my work here as an ambassador and mentor focused on humanity. Our self-directed culture has given me the opportunity to decide quite independently how to use my competencies. I am excited to continue my journey – maybe you would also like to join us?", Marko Taali ,Meet our people , 24.3.2021
Biometric cards upgrade: Easier and cheaper than you think,/en/blog/2021/03/biometric-upgrades-easier-and-cheaper-than-you-think/,Digitalization / Steve Warner / 22.3.2021,"In January this year, we conducted research  showing more than four in five UK consumers are concerned about infection risk when paying in store, one factor which explains why contactless transactions now account for up to 80 percent of all face-to-face payments. With the UK contactless transaction limit set to rise to £100 (€110) per transaction from 6th April 2021, however, consumers are also increasingly worried about fraud and theft on their contactless cards. These findings were replicated in sophisticated Nordic markets like Sweden, where TietoEVRY research revealed 80 percent of consumers are concerned about infection risk, and 57 percent concerned about contactless fraud.Contactless: cards preferredFor all these reasons, biometric cards are widely seen as the next logical step for issuers. While some might think biometrically-secured mobile wallets are the answer, research from Visa USA shows more than two-thirds of consumers prefer cards to mobile wallets as they are familiar with using them, and have concerns about data privacy on their smartphone. Our own white paper suggests around half of consumers across the UK, Sweden and Norway would switch bank to get a biometric card, while more than 80 percent of consumers want to take part in a biometric trial as soon as possible.Simple implementationBiometric cards work via a sensor on the card which captures an image of the cardholder’s fingerprint, confirming this with a record of the fingerprint stored securely in the card’s chip. This data flow is powered by the same circuit used by the POS terminal’s near-field communication (NFC) for existing contactless cards, meaning terminal upgrades are minimal. Changes to back-end transaction processing systems to permit biometric contactless cards are likewise minor, meaning that integration costs are as low as possible.Consumers ready to absorb costsThere’s no doubt that biometrically-enabled contactless cards are more expensive than chip-and-magnetic-stripe. However, enthusiasm for biometric security is such that more than half (55.4 percent) of UK consumers said they would pay more for a biometric card, with 66 percent saying they wanted to get one as soon as possible (34 percent), or at some point in the next year (32 percent).With rising contactless limits, ongoing health concerns and rocketing rates of fraud, biometric cards are the payment solution consumers want. A recent study from Juniper Research estimates biometrics will be used to secure $2 trillion in payments by 2025 – and issuing banks must act quickly to make sure their cards remain top of wallet, rather than lose ground to mobile payment solutions offered by big tech companies. However, the switch to biometrics doesn’t need to be expensive or complicated, as our new white paper shows.To find out more about why you need to switch to biometric payment cards, download TietoEVRY’s white paper “Securing the Revolution: the next step in contactless transactions”.", Steve Warner ,Digitalization , 22.3.2021
Digital inequality is a more important theme than ever,/en/blog/2021/03/digital-inequality-is-a-more-important-theme-than-ever/,Sustainability / Elisa Vepsäläinen / 17.3.2021,"Startup Refugees was established exactly five years ago when more than 30,000 asylum seekers arrived in Finland within a short time. Something had to be done to help the new arrivals find work and start businesses in their new home country.During our five years in operation, we have seen up close how work is the key in opening doors to a new homeland, building contacts with Finnish people, helping with language learning, and providing meaningful activities even when the future may otherwise be uncertain. For many people employed through Startup Refugees, the key issue is getting the opportunity to support themselves rather than living on social assistance.Finding new jobs very quickly became more challenging than before due to the coronavirus pandemic. Refugees began contacting Startup Refugees more frequently through various channels, as many of those who we had helped to find work suddenly lost their jobs. Our Arabic and Dari-language coordinators had previously met dozens of jobseekers and training participants face-to-face each day, but we now had to shift to using various online tools at short notice.However, everything has gone surprisingly well. Because refugees are used to communicate online with their relatives on the other side of the world, they found it much easier to make the transition to virtual interaction than we had expected. Often easier than we did. As finding a job has become more difficult and many organizations are laying off people, we have concentrated our investments in online training, mentoring, and other skills that support vocational competencies and help finding work in Finland when the job markets revive.The biggest leap is perhaps that we are suddenly going nationwide with our activities as the physical location of the training and the trainer is less important. Various online training sessions and webinars have lured participants throughout the country. We are also reaching people from smaller towns, remote areas, and locations that Startup Refugees hasn’t been able to reach previously. Even participants from Azerbaijan, who found our service through social media, were included in our entrepreneurship program.The coronavirus crisis has highlighted the importance of cooperation: Startup Refugees’ activities would look very different without the support of the companies and organizations in our network. The year of the pandemic also impacted our collaboration with TietoEVRY. Fortunately, our cooperation to fight digital inequality has been underway for three years, and our shared experiences have eased the building of cooperation via remote connections.The theme of digital inequality seems more relevant than ever. Now if ever, there is a need to support the digital skills of refugees and employment in the digital sectors, where jobs are not as uncertain as those dependent on physical proximity.We moved our series of face-to-face workshops with TietoEVRY experts from office to online. Workshop themes included using LinkedIn for job-seeking, the future of utilizing data, and the importance of improving the customer experience.It’s been great to see that everyone is pulling in the same direction: recruiters use masks diligently, jointly arranged webinars are recorded for later use, and new trainings are designed to meet the changing needs of jobseekers.The worst-case scenario did not materialize and after an uncertain spring and quiet summer on the labor market, the autumn went surprisingly well. There is still a need for our experts and we can continue providing companies around Finland with employees.Find out more about collaboration between TietoEVRY and Startup Refugees.Would you like to be involved in supporting Startup Refugees?

Building agility and bridging the skills gap with the power of one,/en/blog/2021/03/building-agility-and-bridging-the-skills-gap-with-the-power-of-one/,Digitalization / Mark Judd / 17.3.2021,"In talking to our CHRO customers, all of them consistently agree that their companies are currently focused on creating the right responsive and agile organisations. They're looking to establish a great place to work for all their employees, and they need to create a highly skilled and resilient company. Moreover, they know their businesses are continually looking to create efficient workforce operations and payroll processing that can be truly transformational. CHROs also want systems that make their operations not only effective, easy to use, accurate, well informed and that produce good data, but also reduce manual intervention.CHROs, however, are profoundly aware that employee expectations are changing. Employees expect a consumer-like experience and want to engage with systems that are personalised, relevant and contextual. And CHROs know if the services they provide don’t meet employee standards, they risk failing in the process of creating an engaged and productive workforce.Frictionless foundationIt all starts with a frictionless foundation. And by that, I mean the worry-free service delivery of a true cloud offering. With that foundation in place you can start to develop a clear picture: your financial + people + operational data, in a unified data core. Data is always live, easy to understand and secure.This frictionless foundation allows us to move quickly and effectively to deploy new technologies. It is, for example, enabling us to provide our customers with the benefits of Machine Learning, conversational assistance, and data-to-data point analysis. New capabilities, such as these, can help us to guarantee a consumer standard experience. At the same time, it helps large customers, with multiple sites, and thousands of employees, to standardise practices in areas such as recruitment and training procedures — which we know can be a vital asset to maximise workplace performance.So, let’s take a brief look at what the Workday Human Capital Management (HCM) will be able to offer you and your organisation, now and in near the future:1. Strategic workforce planning based on skillsKnowing what skills are available within the business and what needs to be acquired to solve business problems, is critical for the CHRO. People analytics will enable CHROs, managers, and leaders, to understand the aggregate skills that they have in your organisation. We are building algorithms into our products that help to create real insights as to the net and aggregated skills that you've got within the business. Our algorithms will look for information and data that otherwise require you to engage separate management information teams to gather this information and pull it forward for you. Workday’s technology, instead, will do that for you. It will create dynamic dashboards that can be utilised to surface relevant information. Information, that in conjunction with our standard dashboards, reports or discovery boards (which are configurable dashboard capability for data), will enable our customers to really understand a very clear picture of what their skills capability looks like at any point in time.Building skills into our solutions as a unit of measurement enables our customers to look at where they may need to recruit or upskill, in order to address business problems. It is a great way to commence scenario planning for all future events. This is where Workday Skills Cloud comes into play. Launched in 2018, it is a unique tool that makes it possible for our customers to use a centralised skills library in the cloud featuring over 55,000 different skills.We're also creating Skills Match, now live in the product. This allows managers, and HR teams, to match open requisitions with existing candidates in the business that have the right skill set. We’re now looking at ways of deploying new capabilities that allow us to bring external survey data for market compensation survey management into the Workday product — enabling compensation experts to benchmark the data in the external market through machine learning, instead of doing it manually.In conjunction with machine learning, Workday’s HCM solutions will also enable our customers to apply the data set right across the lifecycle of human capital management. In doing so, they can start to create some truly informative ideas about the way in which we can bring together concepts such as strategic workforce planning in line with recruitment and development, etc. And as a consequence of that, this gives our customers a real opportunity to get to the heart of what really matters to their business.2. Recruitment and upskilling made easyAll CHROs know that recruitment and the management of individuals own learning and development are key ways of addressing strategic workforce planning. At Workday, we also acknowledge the importance of this function and we’re heavily investing in ensuring our technology can help managers and HR can make recruitment more effective, and identify the right learning for the right people.In terms of recruitment, as it stands, many organisations have two or three ways in which they move employees and fill new roles. They either have very lengthy and complex internal recruitment processes that look very similar to their external recruitment processes. But they also know a lot about their employees and still run them through those traditional processes of interviews assessments. We enable recruiters to change this. Using Skills again, we've created the Talent Marketplace, a talent mobility solution that enables employers to connect their people with targeted opportunities for greater organisational agility. Talent Marketplace also fosters employee development and helps HR, and managers, to better allocate talent to meet evolving business needs—all greatly improving how work gets done.In addition, we have Recruitment Hub, which brings together all tools recruiters need into one centralised hub. This solution empowers recruiters to personalise their workspaces so every individual can work the way they want, streamline the recruitment process, and provide a better candidate experience.Upskilling existing talent is equally as important as recruitment — not only for retention but also for employee productivity. When it comes to upskilling, Workday is actively improving the whole way in which learning lands on the desktops of employees. Talent Marketplace delivers more personalised, data-driven opportunity recommendations to empower employees to take an active role in their development while enabling organisations to promote internal mobility to keep their best workers.For example, a sales associate interested in developing a career in marketing could use Workday Talent Marketplace to find hands-on experiences in that field. With tailored recommendations for internal marketing gigs or projects, this person could pursue the growth opportunities that align most with their career goals and aspirations. This has been particularly important for many of our customers, whose workforce has become more distributed, or where opportunities to work in the classroom have dissipated as a consequence of COVID-19.3. Personalisation perfectionFinally, to create a great place to work, CHROs recognise the importance of treating every employee as an individual. Employee experience has to be every bit as delightful as the consumer experiences they have outside the workplace. Let’s use an analogy to explain what we mean — Our homes. Before the era of smart homes, our homes were unable to predict remarkably little. Now the lights come on, the temperature adjusts and your favourite music starts to play, all with the click of a button. This is how Workday is thinking about the employee experience. We're redefining what it means to know people, their interests, actions and tendencies, so we can quickly provide personalised recommendation notifications and an unforgettable experience.To do this, we are using the latest and predictive technologies. We start with an intuitive and relevant homepage, greeting users with a familiar card-style interface that has relevant content. We are introducing journeys and a completely tailored set of tasks that are presented when additional guidance is needed. For example, we can help a new manager better understand the tasks, they should be aware of.  Or, while onboarding, getting them off on the right foot and setting them up for success in their new role.As we continue to invest in transformative technologies, such as machine learning, natural language processing and enterprise search, Workday will get even smarter and make the job of the CHRO and their team easier. We will make it simpler for employees to find what they want, when they want it. We’re also building a native knowledge base. This new search service will make it possible to assist employees throughout their tenure, to be more productive and lead more meaningful work lives.The end goal is, no more enterprise versus consumer. Just what people need, when they need it.The future nowWhile 2020 might have been the year that changed the world, we’re on the precipice of the future. CHROs have the opportunity to dynamically change the way they engage employees, and both meet and exceed their expectations. And they can do this all while shoring up to meet their businesses’ strategic needs, and lowering the volume of traditionally painstaking manual tasks. Using Workday’s solutions, computers can now say yes, instead of saying no. And this is the future we all want, and business needs.Do you like what Workday HCM has to offer?

Headless SAP - improved usability and a smooth transition to S/4HANA,/en/blog/2021/03/headless-sap/,Digitalization / Kari Pietiläinen / 4.3.2021,"In this blog we’ll learn:What headless architecture is
How it can significantly improve the SAP ERP user experience
How it can make the transition to S/4HANA smootherWhat is headless architecture?The idea of headless architecture originates from e-commerce and web content management systems, and the basic idea is very simple: to decouple backend business logic from frontend user interfaces (UIs).In headless architecture, the backend solution provides APIs instead of UIs and basically could be written without any UIs. Our other blog describes a practical guide for headless SAP architecture.In the case of SAP ERP or S/4HANA, it makes sense that the UIs are provided by the back end. SAPGUI and Fiori UI are already available and are not going anywhere. Later we will learn how to apply headless architecture with SAP ERP and S/4HANA, and in the process create something that is beyond standard SAP.Watch the video below to hear experts from SAP talking about headless architecture for SAP Commerce Cloud.How does headless architecture improve the SAP user experience?For many SAP ERP systems the 80:20 rule holds true – 80% of users use only 20% of the functionalities, while the remaining 20% use the majority (80%) of the functionalities.Most users only need access to limited functionalities, such as those for warehouse operations, shop floor tasks, sales operations, or for entering working hours.At the other end of the scale, there are a handful of super users who use several different functionalities and perform complex tasks using SAP.Headless architecture should be used for the first group, i.e. the 80% who only need access to limited functionalities. The picture below illustrates the high-level architecture.In this architecture:task-specific UIs are designed and implemented using React, Angular, or Vue
the middleware layer should be containerized and include user management (including authentication and authorization)
the middleware layer calls back-end APIs with technical user/connection
APIs are purpose-built using ABAP code; however, standard function modules and BAPIs should be used when availableThe middleware layer can run on a hyperscale platform like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or the SAP Business Technology Platform, all of which include plenty of tools to help develop this layer.What are the key benefits of headless architecture?You can design modern, fit-for-purpose UIs and implement them independently from the back end
APIs are often simple and quick to develop, and standard function modules or BAPIs can often be used as a starting point. This is because “headless” users do the same tasks as standard users but in a simpler way.
A well-designed headless SAP architecture is quick, scalable, and secure, with less direct usage/users putting a strain on your business-critical backend and part of the load being taken by the hyperscale platform.
SAP administration – especially roles, authorizations, and user management – becomes simpler because most user management is done in the middleware layer. A well-defined middleware layer will support your needs in a simple and secure way.
A decoupled backend gives you more time to migrate to S/4HANA and means much less change management effort towards your end users – just keep your APIs as they are and let your headless users continue their work.A smooth transition to S/4HANAS/4HANA brings many improvements to SAP ERP, not least the ability to use Fiori UIs instead of SAP GUIs. However, it’s important to note that both the technical setup and user training for new Fiori UIs require a significant amount of work and can be challenging. In the worst case, you will need to modify SAP’s standard Fiori UIs or develop your own.Headless architecture and modern UIs developed for your SAP ERP allow you to focus on new S/4HANA functionality and capabilities and improve your business processes. Relatively simple usage by the majority of your users means things should go very smoothly in your S/4HANA project. Basically, a few ABAPers just migrate your APIs from ERP to S/4HANA.SummaryHeadless architecture is a hot topic in digital commerce – an area that traditionally predicts future technology trends for more traditional IT systems like ERPs.For those of us in the “traditional” ERP scene, this means we should:study headless architecture principles and technologies

How 5G adds value in the corporate world,/en/blog/2021/02/how-5g-adds-value-in-the-corporate-world/,Cloud / Line Nøst-Klemmetsen / 3.3.2021,"Everyone is talking about it, and yet even the greatest speakers soon get shy when asked to discuss 5G, including its business benefits and best corresponding use cases. Instead, they tend to say 5G is cool but also complicated. Let us try to understand why.However, while we do firmly believe that technology indeed matter, let us also face the fact that no technology can cover all circumstances. The use case reviewed below illustrates the potential of 5G, but 5G has many use cases in which it can bring the best out of technology. Consider all those possibilities as we discuss and demystify 5G a little further.Is 5G just another technology?Yes and no. Essentially, 5G is all about higher frequencies, and it thus has clear advantages over earlier standards. It enables a beautiful variety of consumption models as well. The typical focus is the great speed and coverage of connectivity that 5G provides us with – complemented by the wider pre-existing technology collection.The old phrase “the app is king” should be rephrased as either “any app is king” or “no app is the king”. A varied set of technologies, including 5G, is needed in the application jungle to amaze today’s users, to keep them benefiting from any specific application, and with that, to make society work more intelligently. Consumers do not select one app over another; instead, they base their selections on their particular use cases, which they do indeed select over one another.Industry examples: how WiFi6 and 5G are stronger togetherWhere are the barriers with 5G – if any do exist? Again, the answer is complicated. To deliver the best value, 5G needs complementary technologies. Examples are already present in our daily lives, where we improve our health and happiness through making our buildings smarter, more eco-friendly and more convenient for tenants. These buildings tend to have features like coatings on glass, which tend to have the side effect of keeping radio signals out. Luckily, by bringing WiFi6 into the mix, and understanding that 5G is also about heterogenous networking, this indoor challenge is resolved.Of course, it is not only WiFi6 that should be bundled with 5G. There are further technologies that benefit from 5G. For example, combining 5G with a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) can boost bandwidth, secure backups, enable sites to load faster and support solutions that are resilient from top to bottom, throughout their cross-dependencies in architecture.And here are a few more key use cases. By utilizing 5G, we can enable high-quality real-time video from autonomous vehicles and drones to enhance their efficiency. This would also improve the safety of other road users, such as cyclists and pedestrians. All precision operations are enhanced by 5G too, as it enables a higher density of connected devices and supports the low latency required. In manufacturing, greater autonomy can be unlocked in robotics, as time-sensitive networking via 5G enables connectivity to intelligence in the edge cloud. Furthermore, 5G can also be utilized in the health industry in saving lives through video consultations, assistance robots and smart wearables to increase efficiency and effectiveness of treatments.How to utilize 5G and enable apps – from promise to realityWhile the current arguments mostly circle around consumer benefits, of course 5G is a lot more than that. As shown in the use cases above, it is also about making businesses work more efficiently. However, this increasing opportunity in B2B is overshadowed by the cry for higher bandwidth as well as the now natural demand for high quality connected experience everywhere. This demand is currently seen as one of the main drivers for large-scale 5G adoption, which will ultimately benefit business.Network slicing provides another interesting opportunity for manufacturers. Slicing basically refers to separating virtual networks from their given 5G networks and delivering these to customers or applications individually. This achieves global connectivity through a more cost-effective solution, while significantly reducing operational overhead.Every trial starts with targets to improve safety, reduce costs and accelerate time to value. While many of the solutions are here to stay, we are still at the start of the evolving journey of quite a few more. This means we are currently working with hypotheses yet to be proven and looking for investment paybacks to realize eventually. Once the hype curve (Gartner 2019) settles, odds are that 5G will grow roots deep within the connectivity market and become one essential part of how the world works smarter, sharper, and more together.The emergence of fast, low latency 5G networks comes at a crucial time, as the pandemic has challenged the current ways of working overnight, creating an extensive need for more secure and more reliable connectivity for people working remotely. This shift in the new normal of how we live and work – in terms of both social and physical distancing – accentuates the need for continuous mobile connectivity.Connect with us to take your connectivity and applications to the next level!", Line Nøst-Klemmetsen ,Cloud , 3.3.2021
Wealth trends 2021: Goal-based investing,/en/blog/2021/03/what-is-goal-based-investing-and-why-it-was-time-for-an-outside-in-approach/,Data / Sameer Datye / 2.3.2021,"Then, instruments and strategies are suggested to meet them within the risk parameters best suited to that specific customer. With goal-based planning, the planning happens backward from an expected end-result. The outcome is the focus and not the method or the tools. Goals can be myriad - ranging from wanting to have a summer cottage by 2030, achieving retirement by the age of 45, creating a sustainable pension payout etc. A goal-based planning approach enables tailored fitment. The customer's aspiration and not cashflow is now at the centre of the universe.This requires a diametrically opposite change in the way financial advice has been rendered till now. Generic and commoditised advise dished out earlier is obsolete. Financial advice has to be now tailor made specifically for the unique condition sets for an individual customer. To make things more grounded and transparent, the customer needs to know the probability of achieving the goals and the actions needed to optimise the chances.Ronald Janssen of Ortec Finance says, ""Goal Based Planning is based on a client centred approach. The personal goals of a client are translated into an optimal investment plan. In many cases the savings account delivers not enough return, so consumers must take risk to have a realistic probability to realise their goals"".The customers want or at least need a perception of being “in control” of own aspirations and methods to finance the same. Technology makes it possible to have real-time analysis of the progress, potential corrective actions in case of divergence, instrument options and availability, risks, costs etc. These multiple dimensions of viewing finances has imbibed an objectivity into the thinking process. Now, financial planning is no longer a subjective esoteric process. All parameters goals, returns, risks, divergencies from plan are measured in cold numbers. All “safety nets” in terms of hedging, diversification and other risk management protocols also has to be clearly defined. This gels well with the new digitally savvy and financially aware customer. The one who listens to his financial advisor but now questions, tracks, verifies and completes several routines in self-service mode.This is a new and tricky situation for the wealth manager. Information overload is a double-edged sword. A false sense of confidence with a know-all attitude of this “Robinhood” trading generation can easily slip into foolish bravado leading to financial havoc. Having too many options could also mean constant switching of financial advisors as well as financial strategies. For goal based investing the customer should know their goals to start with. Furthermore, they should also be able to articulate the goal in tangible manner in financial terms. This is easier said than done. As Michael Kitces & Carl Richards argue that we humans are not tuned to visualise a future vastly different from today. In their podcast they present the idea of possibility-based planning that helps customers discover their goals with meaningful dialogue.Fredrik Davéus of Kidbrooke thinks that goal-based investing and financial planning will have to improve both scale and spread in ways unseen so far and will need to have truly holistic capabilities. Scale is essential to ensure availability at a lower unit cost and maximise reach to end-customers. He further elaborates that this needs to be spread by being included in far more contexts than what is typically the case today, e.g. customer credit decisions, asset purchase decisions, and holistic investment and savings decisions.
This resonates perfectly with what we have encountered and learnt in recent customer interviews. Goal-based investing solutions helps the customer with visibility, accessibility and actionability towards a financial future of choice within the known limitations.

Is strong customer authentication and frictionless card payments a contradiction?,/en/blog/2021/02/is-strong-customer-authentication-and-frictionless-card-payments-a-contradiction/,Cybersecurity insights / Line Snefrid Borgsø / 25.2.2021,"TietoEVRY’s Risk-based Authentication Engine will identify low-risk payments and allow them to be processed without SCA in order to reduce friction in online card payments. At the same time, high-risk transactions will be declined on the grounds of potential fraud. Transactions in the gray zone (i.e., that fall somewhere between low risk and high risk) will be secured by SCA two-factor authentication. The built-in fraud rate calculations will ensure that exemption amounts are correctly set. This will increase customer satisfaction and deliver a real-time frictionless customer experience.So far, the payment card industry has focused on implementing the SCA requirements, but now it is time to consider how to safely reduce the use of SCA. Since most online card payments are genuine transactions, how can these payments be safely exempted from the SCA rules?Why is a frictionless experience so important?According to Statistics Norway, e-commerce shopping in Norway increased by 9.2 percent between 2018 and 2019 and by 36 percent between Q4 2019 and Q4 2020. At same time, customers expect their online shopping experience to be easy and frictionless. In Norway we use BankID for SCA, and many European countries have adopted similar solutions. The question is what happens if BankID is unavailable at the time of payment? There is a huge risk that the customer will then choose to use a card from a different issuer, one that creates less friction at checkout. So, ensuring a frictionless experience is important for both the cardholder and the card issuer.Finanstilsynet, Norway’s financial supervisory authority, published a news article on 2 February 2021 encouraging the payment industry to utilize the exemptions to SCA provided in the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2):Contactless payments
Unattended terminals for transit and parking
Recurring payments
Trusted merchants
Low-value remote transactions
Transaction risk analysisUnder the transaction risk analysis (TRA) exemptions, electronic payment transactions may be considered as low fraud risk and be exempted from SCA when specific conditions are met. For example, fraud rates calculated by the payment service provider must be equivalent to, or lower than, the reference fraud rates specified in PSD2. It also requires a real-time analysis to identify any abnormal spending behavior and take into account information about payment device, software and malware, known fraud scenarios, and information on the location of the payer and the payee. The analysis should be performed in real time, based on current and historical transaction data.In sum, TRA exemptions require a new way of thinking and some complex analyses based on both 3D-secure authentication and payment authorization.TietoEVRY’s Risk-based Authentication EngineTietoEVRY now delivers a new solution called the Risk-based Authentication Engine (RBA Risk Engine). This solution will combine data from the different processes so that TRA can be performed according to the requirements. This solution will provide TRA for card issuers to ensure that all online card payments are analyzed in compliance with TRA requirements. The RBA Risk Engine solution benefits from TietoEVRY’s long experience in card security and fraud monitoring solutions. The strength of our existing solutions enables us to build a risk-based authentication engine that utilizes the TRA exemptions while enhancing the quality of existing card monitoring systems.TietoEVRY strongly believes that utilizing the TRA exemptions and declining highly suspicious 3D-secure authentications will reduce friction for cardholders, optimize conversion rates and reduce fraud losses for the issuing banks. Let’s not forget that a happy cardholder is a loyal cardholder!Read more about TietoEVRY's Financial Crime Prevention services here.", Line Snefrid Borgsø ,Cybersecurity insights , 25.2.2021
An intelligent brand-level customer experience – the next battlefield for competitiveness?,/en/blog/2021/02/an-intelligent-brand-level-customer-experience/,Digitalization / Jari Kekkonen / 24.2.2021,"According to Forrester Research *, an excellent customer experience is strongly correlated with positive growth, profitability, and customer retention – regardless of industry or business model. The customer experience has become the most important competitive factor for many companies.A winning customer experience is also reflected in the core of strategy of more and more Finnish listed companies. In practice, however, we are still in the early stages, and the customer experience is largely managed point-by-point with very traditional means. What would need to change to make the customer experience a true competitive advantage in a multi-channel business environment?Designing and developing a user experience for an individual service or product is relatively easy. However, as consumers and business customers, we expect a good, if not almost complete, customer experience across every service and transaction situation.Producing a winning customer experience, therefore, requires a holistic brand-level approach to developing and managing the customer experience. This is a completely different matter than developing the user experience for individual services or products. Unfortunately, the digital customer experience quite often still very much refers to the latter.Therefore, I argue, that companies can only build a lasting competitive advantage by managing and developing the customer experience holistically at the brand level, forgetting traditional point-by-point development.A brand-level customer experience does not happen spontaneouslyA brand-level customer experience requires a common state of mind from top management outwards, as it often requires major modifications to almost all core processes and customer encounters. It is not just about one-off changes but continuous improvement. Internal operations must be substantially considered from the perspective of the customer in terms of delivering better customer service, marketing and sales, product and service experience, and production and delivery processes.In the past, the customer experience has been “managed” by measuring customer satisfaction such as NPS and collecting customer feedback – and then drawing conclusions from this information and initiating development measures. This cycle has traditionally been repeated once or twice a year. The actual customer experience management and delivery has remained largely the responsibility of individual employees, who have, of course, been guided in how customers should be served and treated.However, a winning brand-level customer experience cannot depend on the excellence of specific individuals. Especially not in an organization where hundreds or even thousands of people are involved in customer interactions. People will still need to be trained and instructed to serve customers better, but this alone will not meet the challenges of the brand-level customer experience.The customer experience is the result of all customer encounters – both digital and personal – and not simply as their sum. A single failed customer experience is often enough to nullify many good experiences.A brand-level customer experience requires a 360° view and a digital management layerA winning brand-level customer experience requires a systemic and intelligent digitized customer experience management layer. This enables the tracking of all customer encounters and provides a continuous 360-degree digitized view of the customer for the personnel involved in customer interactions. This also enables orchestrating customer communications and, for example, personalized content, by taking into account the entire customer life cycle.The technology for implementing an intelligent brand-level customer experience has been around for several years, but too few Finnish companies are able to utilize it effectively yet. This is most often due to the silos between core processes and development functions (e.g. marketing, sales, customer service, digital development, IT) or the lack of a shared vision.A brand-level customer experience strategy directs the development of an intelligent customer experienceDeveloping the customer experience at the brand level requires technology – and above all, a concrete vision and strategy. The strategy should combine positive emotions, intelligent technology, and data. In intelligent customer experience strategy work, for example, the following is taken into account:Customer experience vision and customer stories
Customer segmentation
Value promises and offering
The customer life cycle through a management model as well as service channels
Digital capabilities, data, and architecture for the customer experience
Customer experience business goals and metrics
Customer experience development roadmapThe greatest value of a customer experience strategy can be achieved when it is systematically used as a common design and communication tool for the entire process of customer interface and digital service development.In the following article, my colleague Aleksi Kärkkäinen explains in more detail what a brand-level customer experience strategy should include and why.

The joy of being told what to wear in your native language,/en/blog/2021/02/the-joy-of-being-told-what-to-wear-in-your-native-language/,Digitalization / Emmy Hall / 23.2.2021,"Increasing the feeling of independenceDuring autumn 2019, I started working with an agile innovation-focused team to create something new for the city of Helsingborg. As most of you know, the public sector is under exceptional strain during the pandemic, and the preschools are no exception. Caring for a preschooler is a very important job, to say the least. The staff is continuously trying to spend quality time with each child, and at the same time, they’re teaching them to become independent individuals that can seek out information on their own. The City of Helsingborg and our team strongly believe that we could increase the children’s well-being by increasing the independence they experience. And by increasing the independence, we could remove some of the strain of the staff by reducing the amount of time they were asked the same question by the same children repeatedly, meaning they could spend more quality time with the children they care for.Unlearning what I knowAs a Service Designer, it’s my mission to get inside the heads of the user groups, find the pain point and eliminate them and bring forth functions that bring value to them. Myself and my team were now faced with a completely new challenge, designing digital services for those that aren’t typically catered for. I had to unlearn, something which sounds less challenging than it is. I had to unlearn what brings joy; is it being able to have a look at the menu and seeing a picture of the food, or is it having the food read out to you in the language you speak at home?Inclusion by designIn the project LAIban, we developed an AI-bot, presented as an app on an iPad, that allows the preschoolers to become more independent individuals. They can ask LAIban what to wear before heading outside, and LAIban quickly gathers the weather forecast-data and gives them a suggestion, with descriptive images to follow. They can ask what’s for lunch, and LAIban quickly translates the municipality’s menu to something the children understand; “Farmed cod with breadcrumbs, pureed new potatoes with a lemon and dill sauce” becomes “fish, potatoes, and sauce”. However, inclusion is much more than being able to understand something; it’s also about being represented and being able to share something. LAIban speaks and displays text in numerous languages, meaning that preschoolers who don’t have Swedish as a native language spoken at home can share their language with their peers. To us, this was simply a language feature. To the children, this was a source of pride and joy; they weren't just being included, they were being seen. As a Service Designer, contributing to making children feel better about themselves is something I am extremely proud of having been a part of. Happiness in children is hard to measure but undeniably extremely important.How to unlearn and be inclusiveFor me, the key to unlearning has been to work with a hypothesis and constant feedback-loops from the users and interpret the results as they are by reminding myself to let go of all biases I’ve gathered in my working life. We’re letting the users be the driving force behind the development, and we’re quick to develop what needs to be developed and implement it for tests.How to excel in digitalization in different user groupsInterested in how to create inclusive digital services and learn more about how Helsingborg continues to excel in digitalization?

Service Desk – teamwork across departments,/en/blog/2021/02/service-desk--teamwork-across-departments/,Meet our people / Anu  Peltola / 22.2.2021,"I have always been fascinated by the diversity and various challenges of Service Desk work, and somehow I find myself drawn to this job over and over again.I started in TietoEVRY around two years ago in the SIAM unit (Service Integration and Management), but then I was offered an opportunity to take over the Service Desk unit.With a long work history in leading and developing a Service Desk service, I felt confident moving on to this new role at TietoEVRY. At the moment, I am responsible for Service Desk in Finland and our new Service Desk unit in Vaasa.What makes a Service Desk Manager?As the manager of our Service Desk team, I feel that my most important job is to be there for my team members and offer them help and solutions. I try to create an open atmosphere of trust so that everyone in the team feels free to approach me with whatever they have on their mind. This also makes it easier for me to come up with solutions when needed.More generally, TietoEVRY is a very transparent and encouraging working environment in which everyone, all the way to the senior management, shares information openly. We value teamwork and collaborate a lot across teams and departments.Teamwork has an especially pronounced role at Service Desk because we collaborate with specialists in different departments. This means that we do not solve all the problems during one phone call with the customer but sometimes forward tickets to specialists. Therefore, our tasks involve getting to know a wide variety of IT jobs. Sometimes, people find their own field of specialization through working at Service Desk.As a manager, it is important for me that I can offer my team members career opportunities, too. Sometimes, I have to let go of good employees because of this, but I’m always happy to see others succeed.The right attitude and a desire to find solutionsThe atmosphere at Service Desk is always great. This line of business attracts a lot of like-minded people, so teams usually bond easily.Traditionally, people find work at Service Desks after their IT studies. Naturally, it is important to have an IT education and an understanding of technology, but having the right attitude and problem-solving skills are crucial, too. We need to have a desire to solve problems and deal with issues that are not always that straightforward.We do a lot of customer work, which places importance on good communication skills. Our job is to support our customers in the challenges they face and help them succeed. We often serve customers over the phone, but various chats are a common form of communication these days.Our unit always appreciates language skills since TietoEVRY is an international company and our working language is English. Our international work environment offers many opportunities for our employees, and you can certainly put your language skills to good use. We get to work with specialists from many different countries, even in our units in Finland.Service Desk is in my DNADespite always feeling that Service Desk is my thing, I have, of course, had many other jobs during my career. For the first 10 years after graduating, I worked as a programmer.In addition to programming, I have worked as a project manager and service manager for 20 years in total. During this period, I got acquainted with Service Desk work for the first time when I was presented with the opportunity to become the manager of the Service Desk team.After that, I have done a lot of work around developing Service Desk, and I must say I like my job!We are now hiring Service Desk Specialists to our new service desk unit in Vaasa!", Anu  Peltola ,Meet our people , 22.2.2021
A journey begins – Service Desk Specialist in the making,/en/blog/2021/02/a-journey-begins--service-desk-specialist-in-the-making/,Meet our people / Merita Buck  / 22.2.2021,"I have always been passioned about computers and IT ever since I was young, so it was a natural choice to also study and eventually start working in the IT industry.My TietoEVRY journey started recently and currently I am in training to master my future tasks as a Service Desk Specialist. I have previous Service Desk work experience from another company where I worked for four years.The training period has gone really well, which has been a positive surprise! It’s great when a company invests in proper training for new employees. It makes such a positive impact right from the start and the training creates a solid foundation for all of us trainees.Another benefit of the training period is that I have already gotten to know my future colleagues. This is something that is very important to me as getting to know your co-workers early on always makes it easier to work together in the future. It’s so much easier to ask questions and communicate when you know your colleagues well.As we are still in the midst of a pandemic, the training sessions have been held completely remotely. Luckily Teams meetings and other remote practices are already so familiar to everyone, that it hasn’t even been an issue. And thanks to remote connections, our trainer has actually conducted the sessions all the way from Czech Republic.Finding solutions drives meThe best part of Service Desk work is solving and figuring out the various issues for the customers. Every working day is different and often it feels as time is literally flying when there are so many things to do and so many issues to solve.Most of the time the customer issues are related to hardware, applications and permissions - such as the printer is not working, or someone is failing to log in somewhere. Certain types of support requests are also seasonal: for example, after the summer holidays, there are many calls from people who have forgotten their work computer username and passwords.When I manage to solve a customer’s problem, it feels really rewarding. Even if the problem is small and easy for me to solve, it still may be a big deal for the customer.Attitude is everythingA good background for a Service Desk Specialist is in computer studies and of course it’s good to have a general interest towards computers and IT. I have a diploma in Computer Sciences and this spring I will graduate and be an Automation Technology Engineer. I also have previous work experience from the customer service side, which has helped a lot.  After all, this job is also basically customer service, just with a twist.As with most jobs, a good attitude will carry you a long way when working in a Service Desk. In addition, it’s beneficial to have a curious mind and an interest towards problem solving.It’s also essential to learn new things quickly. Sometimes the customer may use a program or a software that I am not familiar with, but I still need to be able to solve their issues. As the job is continuous learning, I feel like I am constantly growing as a professional.Career opportunities and a relaxed atmosphereMy background has proven to be very useful now in Service Desk work, but my studies also enable a different career paths for me in the future.As a large international company, TietoEVRY offers many career opportunities and I have been encouraged to make my own career plan as part of the training. The training has also included a lot of issues related to well-being at work, such as video lectures on how to manage stressful situations and how to cope better at work. I already have a feeling that TietoEVRY really values us as employees and we are all encouraged to develop our skills.Even though I have only just started at TietoEVRY, the atmosphere has been very open, encouraging and relaxed. Supervisors are easy to approach and easy to contact. I have a feeling that my ideas are valued here, which is really important. It motivates me more as an employee when I know that I can influence my own work.I also really enjoy the international vibe at TietoEVRY. I have now colleagues from several different countries, which is a great asset to the entire work community.My expectations for my work at TietoEVRY are high. It’s exciting to work for such a big company, develop my skills and hopefully even move up the career ladder at some point. I am very excited and plan to work here at TietoEVRY for a long time.We are now looking for Service Desk Specialists to Vaasa - check out and apply now!", Merita Buck  ,Meet our people , 22.2.2021
A smooth user journey lays the foundation for a positive customer experience,/en/blog/2021/02/a-smooth-user-journey-lays-the-foundation-for-a-positive-customer-experience/,Digitalization / Kaisa Kauppinen / 19.2.2021,"Across all industries, success in customer experience, as a state of mind, is an essential requirement for delivering quality operations and having a competitive edge.However, as the name suggests, the customer experience is always the customer's experience, which is influenced by the individual’s expectations, previous experience, and what and how they see during their journey. Ultimately, the customer decides what the customer experience looks like for them.As a concept, the customer experience is multidisciplinary; made up from smaller experiences that come together to form a whole. To achieve customer experience strategic goals, it is essential to define concrete actions aimed at achieving the desired outcome and how the required work will be managed. Additionally, it is important to identify areas that need investment; these are the sub-experiences of the customer experience which often carry the highest expectations.The user experience is one of the core areas we invest in when we are developing our healthcare information systems. This is particularly relevant to our customers as solutions must support, facilitate, and enhance the working lives of their staff, so that the core of their work, the care of patients, can succeed as planned. This is why we always strive for excellence when building the user experience in our solutions.Every working day made smooth and efficientThe user experience is the holistic view of the end-to-end journey of using a product or service, its usability and usefulness. A positive user experience is smooth, easy, and has a well-timed flow.For our customers, while general usability requirements and the visual appearance of the solution are important, it is the actual design of the healthcare information system, and how it works, that defines success. The system must consider patient and information safety, be efficient, and limit the possibility of user errors.It is vitally important to remember that the ‘user’ of the information system is a person. A person with feelings, knowledge, skills, experience, and expectations. Professionals within the social and healthcare ecosystem are affected by their work environment, working across multiple information systems and tools, their organisation’s operating methods and processes, and legal and social requirements. It is essential to understand the complexity and totality of the expected user experience to build and implement a successful solution.End user experience key to successFrom a high-level perspective, an excellent user experience is achieved by design that incorporates three factors: user understanding, quality processes and tools, and measurement or evaluation.The most important aid for understanding and then creating an excellent user experience is the actual end user. By engaging with and carrying out research with end users, we can fully understand the workflow of specific social and healthcare professionals and environments. We uncover the important factors that bring joy to the workplace, the challenges that need to be solved, as well as unearthing hidden needs that a new product or service flow could address. We have to dig deep to identify the problems so we can come up with the best solutions.It is thus essential to find those challenges that are most beneficial to solve. The best results are achieved when we involve stakeholders from across the user journey spectrum to be part of the design phase, as well as at different stages in product development.Research shows that when users have a consistent application experience, cognitive load and frustration is reduced, adoption of new functions is easier, and work process speed is accelerated. Design consistency not only streamlines the product development process, but it also helps to achieve an excellent user experience. That is why we invest in internal processes and tools to deliver solutions to our customers that create exceptional user experiences.Our approach incorporates ongoing communication between our teams and the customers to establish if the user experience is meeting and hopefully, exceeding expectations. We can only know if our goal of delivering an excellent user experience is met by measuring the lived reality of using it.

Time to bring lost revenues back to the cards business,/en/blog/2020/06/bringing-lost-revenues-back-to-the-cards-business/,Digitalization / Jarkko Turunen / 19.2.2021,"Increased competition from new entrants – fintech and neo banks;
Decreased fees for card related services;
Lost income from interchange fee cap for consumer products in Europe.As an issuer, you need to find new revenue streams – and the obvious place to start is with credit cards as interest income is still a major revenue stream for cards operations. In our experience, having the ability to migrate transactions between debits and installments or providing products like buy now/ pay later, can bring lost revenues back to a business.Growing revenues with credit originationThe first thing to start is to look into existing credit origination process. Technological development in the recent years and information availability has opened up new ways how to look on the credit origination process. Credit origination provides yet another great opportunity to grow revenues from existing customer portfolio. Thanks to open banking, multiple sources can now be used to score customers and extend credit services to people who, in the past, wouldn’t have met requirements for higher credit limits. We are also seeing a trend towards real-time credit approvals as opposed to pre-approved agreements. Instant credit origination enables consumers to make purchases, beyond credit limits, when previously the sale would have been declined.These are the types of automated credit services we provide for our customers to help them turn dwindling markets into growing markets. Of course, a modern infrastructure is essential if you want to offer customers all-encompassing services with buy online, real-time conversions, loan installments and credit limit increases ­– all supported by digital channel and e-signatures.Data – the key to opening up the marketMoving forward, we believe that third-party collaborations and integrations will become the norm. There is already a great deal of data available, and this will only increase as we get access to account and other relevant data in order to verify salaries and spending patterns. Being able to deliver targeted and timely offers based on this data will influence the way your customers behave and consume services.No matter if you are a nationwide, regional or global provider, at the end of the day you are going to have to find ways to differentiate yourselves from competitors. In our opinion, the best way to do this is through data, which will come down to the way it’s collected, structured, analyzed and used. Areas where we are already well ahead of the curve and can make sure you are too.

Retail in 2021 – the technology trends speeding up digital transformation,/en/blog/2021/02/retail-in-2021--the-technology-trends-speeding-up-digital-transformation/,Digitalization / Giselda Autio / 17.2.2021,"The already rapid pace of digital transformation is set to increase even further, with exciting technological enablers that will open up plenty of opportunities for retailers who are willing to invest and take the lead.1. Contactless technology – biometric payments for safety and convenienceContactless technology has been one of the winners during the global pandemic, with examples like self-checkout facilities in stores enabling a more hygienic, comfortable, and convenient shopping experience. In 2021 we will see new options with enhanced technology. In 2020, TietoEVRY and OP Financial Group joined forces to develop a pilot biometric payment card that enables secure payments on purchases exceeding 50 euros in value. Payments can be processed via a fingerprint sensor and fingerprint linked to the payment card, eliminating the need to touch the payment terminal. Similar experiments have also been carried out in Amazon Go stores using a payment method that scans palm prints.2. Robotics – from autonomous deliveries to supply-chain transformationAutonomous deliveries using driverless cars and drones are the future of retail, and big players such as Walmart and Walgreens have already started experimenting with these methods in the USA. In logistics centers and stores, robots can be used to speed up inventory management and fulfillment processes. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is becoming mainstream, creating value and agility across the value chain. RPA increases compliance, improves operations and service quality, and reduces the time spent on repetitive, non-value-adding daily tasks such as navigating through various applications and windows.3. Artificial intelligence – adding value online and offArtificial intelligence (AI) continues to provide substantial opportunities for both online stores and traditional bricks-and-mortar businesses. With enhanced omnichannel capabilities, the line between online and offline is becoming increasingly blurred, bringing together the best of both worlds. With new habits established during the pandemic, many people are likely to continue favoring online shopping, and technical capabilities will support this trend. Safer shopping with the help of virtual fitting rooms featuring AR and VR capabilities, customer-facing applications such as chatbots, and recommendation engines that empower in-store staff are just a few examples of AI-enabled applications that can add value in the retail sector.4. 5G – livestreams and everything onlineThe importance of a high-quality mobile internet connection became even more obvious as consumers spent more time online in 2020, and slow connections are no longer an option for retailers either. Livestreams are expected to be one of the biggest trends in marketing and communications in 2021 as they become an established channel for retailers to engage with their customers in the post-pandemic era, and now, with increased 5G capabilities being deployed, retailers can cast livestreams without delays. 5G will also bring major opportunities across the value chain from supply-chain transformation to in-store devices, taking advantage of IoT, gathering and utilizing more data, and enabling further enhancement to social commerce capabilities.A modernized core system such as SAP S/4HANA provides a solid foundation, is a major enabler for the agile development of digital solutions, provides easy access to predictive data, and enables continuous innovation.When we consider what is now possible from a technological point of view, and after seeing how quickly new processes and tools can be implemented when there is a need and a will in retail, 2021 looks set to be an exciting year for the sector, don’t you think?", Giselda Autio ,Digitalization , 17.2.2021
"Time to decide: will waterfall, agile or devops deliver your new card platform",/en/blog/2020/07/waterfall-agile-devops.-what-is-the-most-effective-process-for-your-collaboration-in-delivering-cards-platforms/,Digitalization / Jana  Jansone  / 12.2.2021,"Don’t choose between Waterfall and AgileWhen it comes to delivery, we tend to see three process management options. Firstly, there is Waterfall. This typically involves agreeing on specific objectives during the pre-study and defining dates for deliverables, implementation and go live. Secondly, we have Agile, which involves regular input on objectives and project progression based on deliverables as a moving target. Finally, there is the combination of Waterfall and Agile, which takes the best of both methods to provide flexible parameters and dedicated deliveries that focus on a business case.Waterfall limitationsIn our experience, Waterfall rarely provides the desired results in large integrations. It’s just simply not possible to get the level of detail necessary to ensure expectations are met and transparency is achieved. However, we still believe stepwise implementation is the right way forward it’s just a question of to what degree.Agile vs productivityOver the years we have worked in agile implementations – with dedicated development teams joining customer teams at their offices – but have found that it isn’t as effective as it could be. Daily meetings and ad-hoc communication create a backlog of work and the development process becomes slow and tiresome. Completely agile deliveries are simply not productive enough in our experience. And high productivity is what we all want.Waterfall + AgileSo what’s the answer? We have found that to deliver the optimal results in the most effective way possible, the combination of Waterfall and Agile works best. The delivery team acts as a collaborative function between a client and the development team. Customers’ needs are interpreted and passed to our team, who can focus on delivering the best results as quickly as possible.The end result is a process that works really well for both sides. Development on our side is Agile. Development team representatives, for example, only attend key meetings. But we still have a step by step approach which highlight any issues and ensures the quick delivery of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).Of course, this is all relative. The size of the project will impact the approach. A smaller development project runs fine with Waterfall. We go by a rule of thumb – if it’s under a 200 person-day project, we propose Waterfall with clearly defined and proven steps.Pre-study          Gap analysis         Development              Test         DeliveryFor projects larger than 200 person-days we recommend a mixed approach, which follows a similar process to waterfall but development is done in an agile way by a dedicated client team.Pre-study          Gap analysis         Agile development in stages              Test           DeliveryBusiness based deliveriesAs always the pre-study makes all the difference. Rather than focusing on a client’s existing system, we believe it’s essential to begin at the business end. We work collaboratively to evaluate the opportunities on offer from a new platform and work back to define the optimal solution necessary to deliver the optimal solution both from a technical and process perspective. Based on this we agree on the deliverable MVP. Often, success comes down to a trusting partnership between client and vendor.DevOpsIn a recent infrastructure case for a large bank with nationwide operations, we used DevOps principle of continuous integration, testing and delivery with daily standups. However, the client wasn’t involved in this, only meeting the development team when necessary. Their point of contact was the delivery team member. This process enabled the client to follow the process and adjust requirements during implementation, without impacting efficiency. The DevOps principle is the ideal complement to agile development, within a mixed delivery.In our experience, every large project has change requests and this requires a strong change management process. Thanks to our large customer base we understand our clients’ business requirements and have built-in project processes to support changes mid delivery. A good working relationship between vendor and client is also essential for this to run smoothly.Going from strength to strengthAt the end of the day, we deliver game-changing solutions for our clients. However, we don’t have to keep reinventing the wheel to do this. We have the market-leading products and the platform, which we then tailor to meet the needs of our clients’ operations. That’s our strength and it can become yours.Related blogsThe Fintech dilemma: how to evaluate and collaborate to bring added value to the cards businessDon’t just replace a card platform with a new card platform, deliver a completely new experience for your customers insteadThe AI OpportunityLearn more on Card and financial product management related blog and insight series, case studies and more - click here.", Jana  Jansone  ,Digitalization , 12.2.2021
Tietoevry's Sustainability game plan 2023: Upgrading tomorrow,/en/blog/2021/02/upgrading_tomorrow/,Sustainability / Kia Haring / 12.2.2021,"In the era of radical transparency, our values and views also impact more than ever the ethical framework for companies to operate in; we, be it in the role of a consumer, citizen or employee, define what is accepted and what is not. With the choices we make every day, we influence corporations and even national economies.We expect companies to be active corporate citizens and take a stand on societal issues – climate and human rights related aspects being currently high on the agenda. The high expectations towards companies are set by all key stakeholders, employees, customers and shareholders. Any unethical behavior will gain attention in no time and harm the reputation and stakeholder trust as we have recently seen with global movements like #metoo and #blacklivesmatter.Shaping tomorrow togetherThese realities also set the framework for our operations as TietoEVRY, a public company with Nordic heritage and global operations. As TietoEVRY we are only one-year young, but both former companies, Tieto and EVRY, had a strong focus on sustainability and systematic development of responsible operations. To continue to build trust, create a meaningful workplace and to do our part as a responsible company, we have now created our first TietoEVRY three-year Sustainability game plan “Upgrading tomorrow”. It carries the company’s ambition and commitment for developing our own operations, helping our customers’ to be more sustainable as well as contributing to more sustainable societies.As to our own operations, the TietoEVRY Sustainability game plan outlines the focus areas and sets clear targets expanding to year 2023. These priorities have been concluded as a result of a wide stakeholder dialogue, involving our employees, customers, investors as well as the great public through an online survey and in-depth interviews.TietoEVRY Sustainability game plan consist of four key sections: Climate actions, Ethical conduct and Exciting place to work – each of them divided into concrete topics with clear ambitions, ranging from employee engagement to responsible sourcing. On top of this we have outlined actions and services to enable our customers’ sustainability – called sustainable impact areas.To learn more – please visit our Sustainability pages here.I am personally extremely proud of the following commitments:1. Climate actions – our ambitions towards carbon neutrality:We commit to reduce 80% of the energy related greenhouse gas emissions in our operations during 2020-2023.
We have also sent our ambitions for an external review – and expect them to be qualified as Science Based Targets (verification ongoing) – this means that we have a clearly-defined path to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement goals.
We also commit to re-cycle 100% of the hardware covering our own use as well as devices as service to customers.2. Diversity & inclusion:“Diversity is Innovation. If someone doesn’t look like you, they don’t think like you – and they can help you think different.” said Duncan Wardle, the former vice president of Innovation at Walt Disney. At TietoEVRY, we see diversity of people, beyond of sex, gender identification, ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, sexual orientation, or age being equally valuable and create a good and inspirational workplace. Embracing every individual creates a culture, where everyone can flourish and reach their full potential. As a concrete target to advance equality – we have set an ambition to reach 40% share of female professionals globally by 2026 – and 50% by 2030 – corresponding to 29% today.Learn more about our approach to diversity & inclusion here!3. Sustainable business impact opportunities:IT solutions and the use of data are in a key role in addressing the biggest global challenges of our time, eg. climate change and resource efficiency. As a company operating in these areas, we have great opportunities to do good for society and help our customers become more sustainable. Some of our recent cases include Vaasa, Trondheim – and there is more to come!Launching this three-year Sustainability game plan for the company is an important milestone, but yet only the beginning – we need to share the key commitments with our stakeholders’ in a relevant manner and make them an integral part our everyday work. It takes all of us to ensure these ambitions are met and that we do our part – for Upgrading tomorrow!Stay tuned for our Annual Report on March 2nd!Here is some additional reading related to Sustainability.Ethics in technology – should I care?How to tackle ethics in your day-to-day work", Kia Haring ,Sustainability , 12.2.2021
Time to embrace the third generation of real-time payments,/en/blog/2020/11/the-third-generation-of-real-time-payments-is-here--are-you-ready-to-embrace-it/,Digitalization / Jarkko Turunen / 12.2.2021,"The evolution of payment systemsIf we take a look back, we can see how real-time payment systems have evolved. The first generation offered real-time clearing and settlement of interbank payments. The second generation brought 24/7 availability, direct technical access for non-banks, and immediate confirmation to the payment sender. We are now ushering in the third generation of real-time payments which offers increased data capabilities, improved fraud detection and mitigation, and new processing capabilities such as tokenization.Embracing the next generation From what we have seen so far, the banks that embrace this will develop data-rich value-added services that leverage their core clearing and settlement infrastructure. With growth in third-party collaborations, new ecosystems are developed with service offerings that improve the customer experience and generate new revenues. Payment siloes become a thing of the past, leading to better business agility, while empowering the banks to meet changing customer demands through technology advancements.In the cards business we’ve seen merchant initiated transactions and recurring card transactions for many years. What we’ve learnt while growing this market can now be applied to the new generation of instance payments. And the pitfalls we’ve met and overcome can now be easily avoided. New customer-oriented services can include things like proxy services, request-to-pay, straight-through-processing, as well as digital identity.In those markets that have already deployed next-generation real-time payments successfully, we have seen that many banks offer peer-to-peer payments (P2P) as an early service offering. Not surprisingly most of the functionality being added in second and third generation real-time systems focuses on unlocking C2B and B2B revenues streams.Request-to-payRequest-to-pay (RtP) falls clearly into the category of implementing card innovations and best practices. With RtP a beneficiary can initiate a transaction by sending a payment request. If the payer accepts the request, a real-time credit transfer is initiated. RtP also provides direct debit-like functionality while providing users with complete control of payment flows. It can also greatly improve reconciliation for billers and merchants by incorporating messages with a real-time payment. As such, it can replace direct debit and e-invoicing if it includes a bill presentment link. We believe this will be particularly interesting for merchants as point-of-sale can be incorporated using additional services such as dispute management, an area that card networks have developed over decades.Straight-through-processingWe also expect enhanced data intelligence to be a key enabler of B2B real-time payments. With richer data capabilities and greater automation, enabled in part by ISO 20022, reconciliation is eased, and straight-through-processing (STP) rates can be raised for businesses. Beyond corporate payments, rich payments data will be key to helping banks gain more granular insights into their customers’ behavior as well as interpreting evolving needs.Digital identity Finally, we will see digital identity becoming an even bigger challenge as more and more transactions take place in fully digital spaces. Customers now expect to make all their transactions online with a single identity regardless of the channel or system. This will force banks to manage more complex digital ID services that rely on outside proxies and databases. And the challenge doesn’t end there. Advanced digital ID services will have to be developed for corporates to cope with multiple bank accounts and many unique users in diverse regions.Is your system ready?Although there are challenges ahead, these are easily outweighed by the benefits of third generation real-time payments. As we mentioned above, your system will determine how many of these benefits you can take advantage of. Building out from a legacy system will see you awash in costly and lengthy delays that simply aren’t worth the efforts. To fully embrace next generation real-time payments, you need to look to the new in the form of providers that can deliver a solution that meets your and customers’ expectations.Related blogs:Bringing lost revenues back to the cards business via credit servicesThe Fintech dilemma: how to evaluate and collaborate to bring added value to the cards businessTokenization: the secure way to support merchants, consumers and IoT paymentsLearn more on Card and financial product management related blog and insight series, case studies and more - click here.", Jarkko Turunen ,Digitalization , 12.2.2021
Benefits of keeping the right focus when merging companies,/en/blog/2021/02/benefits-of-keeping-the-right-focus-when-merging-companies/,Meet our people / Trond Vinje / 11.2.2021,"I must admit that it is astonishing to get first-hand experience of the complexity of merging two large Nordic companies such as Tieto and EVRY. We came from two different worlds from both the process and the system perspective, and we started 2020 with hundreds or thousands of different practices that we wanted to align.Merging two worlds is not only about the consolidation of systemsMy main learnings are related to the importance of addressing the “hearts and minds”. Creating synergy comes from combining the technical elements and competitive side of things with the culture, leadership, diversity, and values. All of these sides need to be addressed equally. We can have the best processes and systems, but without starting to build one way of thinking, one way of collaborating and common culture, we cannot be successful.One of the smartest moves we did last year from the perspective of HR, was to focus on establishing one source of data. Consolidation into one HR master system, which is Workday in our context, is a crucial driver for all the other harmonization. Change is always difficult and it takes a lot of time. What gives me energy are the positive sides of the integration, such as seeing more and more engagement between colleagues across Tietoevry; especially given the complicated circumstances.How we as HR can help our customers? Focus on creating employee efficiency and employee engagementMy most positive surprise of 2020 had nothing to do with the integration, but how fast and efficiently we were able to adapt to operating in the new normal. The reports show that we have not dropped in efficiency, which is a great result especially considering the practical difficulties of working from home. I was even more impressed by how swiftly we were able to help our customers adapt to remote work. It was fantastic to get insight on how important our services and products are in customers´ operations.When thinking about the future setup for 2021 and beyond I am concentrating on being data-driven. Any plans around the “back to the office” topic need to focus on the employees´ and the customers´ needs and be based on data instead of beliefs. As HR professionals, we need to understand the business logic that drives the company. In Tietoevry, we provide customers with technology that in some way helps them to be more competitive.The role of HR is to make it easier to be an employee. To enable our employees to take care of our customers, we need to create employee efficiency and employee engagement. Even if you do a very specific job in the HR area, you should be able to translate your contribution into the bigger context. I strongly believe that it is also more fun when you see the big picture and how your work helps employees and customers to thrive.Making system design decisions? Keep people in mindFrom the technical perspective, last year, we focused on building a system that enables us to make company-wide data-driven people management decisions. We could have possibly utilized a combination of integrations, stand-alone analytics software and the “most famous” HR tool in the world – Excel. Instead, we have decided to focus on a single HCM solution and our learning is that having one source of data has been the key driver to harmonization during our merge. The speed was important, and we are lucky to have our own team of Workday consultants who enabled Tieto and EVRY to join forces with an accelerated project taking just a few months.The clear benefit is that with Workday I have global data immediately available from anywhere and am able to analyze this data at all times via a big portfolio of pre-defined reports. When making design decisions about the HR-related tools, the other important perspective to consider is that the best system in the world does not bring value unless people feel it makes their life easier. Therefore, we put an emphasis on automation, accessibility, and self-service for managers and employees. I believe that the right focus is on how to make life easier for employees instead of how to make HR more efficient. For me, the DNA of every HR function is in driving employee engagement and efficiency, which at the end will result in customer benefit.How can we develop company culture in the times of Covid-19?The unpredictability that came with Covid-19 created an additional challenge for the merge of Tieto and EVRY. There is a standard perception that if you are not able to have physical meetings, the culture pays the price. Due to the circumstances of 2020 we had to cancel our integration roadshow and we had to compensate with digital communication. We still have a lot to learn about the right ways to handle communication, but we strongly acknowledge that the top-down approach would not have worked.Developing common ways of working and innovating is not about having executives giving instructions. Instead, it is about having thousands of dialogues across 1300 different teams in Tietoevry. We have done some really good groundwork. I am very happy to recognize that the majority of people (based on our employee satisfaction survey) know about our culture, values and insight into what´s demanded from the leadership. The magic happens when everyone translates this into what is relevant for their teams and for themselves as individuals.We will keep investing time and engaging different stakeholders to develop the definition of our culture and the definition of good leadership in Tietoevry. We also need to keep transparency towards the customers. I strongly believe that our Nordic values of trust, diversity, and openness have to be visible to our customers.Let us make 2021 the year of growth and developmentWhen looking back to 2020 as the year of integration, I'm really looking forward for myself, colleagues from the HR and the company as a whole to have a strong growth and development agenda for 2021.This year I want to learn some new skills, but I also love being in a leadership position providing development for other people. I want us to stay as a company where people turn to, to learn and have good careers, where employees embrace development and use their capabilities to innovate. We aim not only to be a service provider but to be a good partner to our clients. As Covid-19 reminds us, customer proximity is not only physical, but also mainly about the mindset. For 2021 and beyond, my colleagues and I in HR will do our best to keep colleagues across Tietoevry engaged, efficient, and happy, so they can focus on supporting our customers’ requirements.", Trond Vinje ,Meet our people , 11.2.2021
Time to create a digital workplace for beyond the pandemic,/en/blog/2021/02/digital-workplace-beyond-the-pandemic/,Cloud / Mathias Åberg / 4.2.2021,"So, what has been most vital to meeting these exceptional demands? When it comes to moving work into our homes, the digital workplace has been the solution. A real digital workplace is not fixed to any site or location. Instead, it supports personnel wherever they are working.The pandemic has naturally increased the demand for scaling up virtual collaboration capacity and supplying employees with devices and secure home connections. And the situation has challenged the employee experience, as face-to-face contacts are minimal.Strong remote work culture to overcome Covid-19 challenges in the NordicsThe right strategy and investments for the right digital workplaceCompanies with a clear strategy and early investments in the digital workplace have had an easier journey recently. Their maturity in this area has prepared them to take the needed decisions and related actions without delay. Most already understood the benefits of mobile first, user centric and flexible services.According to the recent Digital Workplace of the Future report by ISG, the pandemic has brought relatively less change to working life in the Nordics, where remote working has traditionally been more common than elsewhere globally.In the ISG report, TietoEVRY was acknowledged in 3 quadrants: a rising star in Digital Workplace Consulting, and a leader in both Managed Workplace Services and Managed Mobility Services.In mature companies, the IT environment is up to date, well managed and integrated into the business processes. Early adopters of the digital workplace have taken full advantage of the benefits of self service, automation and analytics, and they help the modern workforce utilize IT support in a comfortable and intuitive way.The digital workplace will not solve the pandemic, but as always, it can support our productivity and enable new sources of efficiency. So, looking beyond the pandemic, what is the key to a vibrant and effective digital workplace that will support companies and organizations in the years to come?First of all, we don’t know what will come next – that’s a fact. But what we do know is that the future will not be the same as today.The situation and overall demands of the future will probably change more and more quickly over time, both in terms of business trends and how global conditions will affect us. This is what I call the new normal.13 hacks to really master the art of remote workPrepare for unexpected changeOf course, we need to prepare the digital workplace for change. It must be agile, flexible, integrated and connected. It needs to support the business when it changes. It has to permit different volumes of usage, so prices and use cases have to be customizable.A modern digital workplace is a complex entity that needs to be managed with strong integration into business processes. New demands require the development, testing and integration of related systems and IT processes. It has to be available, secure, compliant and operational in a predictable way and with the right capabilities.Making these changes within each and every organization is not the way forward. In these ever-changing circumstances, professional service providers have large-scale advantages that allow them to host the comprehensive offerings needed for reliable operations.The success of a business is linked to its business model, which must now support the ever-changing new normal. That means flexibility in volume and charges for just what is used. It also means being prepared for fast onboarding of new services and features.And a good partner knows the development of these services should be done together – with you and your strategic and tactical choices as the starting point. With the right support, you will not only survive the evolution ahead – you will master it.", Mathias Åberg ,Cloud , 4.2.2021
Artificial Intelligence needs history data – don’t delete it,/en/blog/2021/02/artificial-intelligence-needs-history-data--dont-delete-it/,Data / Heikki  Taskinen  / 3.2.2021,"Modern paper, board and pulp mills produce huge amounts of data. For example, there can easily be tens of thousands of data tags in their operational systems, measuring the properties of the product or the status of the machinery. The frequency of the measurements is typically seconds or even milliseconds, which leads to terabytes of data very soon.In such an environment, it is a tempting idea to optimize OT/IT hardware capacity and delete the history data in the systems, or to aggregate the data in your data warehouse and similar solutions.This is definitely not a good idea.Consider the value of your data compared to hardware capacity cost. The value of your data is many times more than the hardware cost to store it. If you delete your history data, you might lose precious information about your process and operations.Data is the food AI needsAs Yazzoom, TietoEVRY’s partner specializing in AI applications for the pulp and paper industry, says, it is important to retain process history data to boost AI capabilities.Process data is the raw material that the machine learning algorithms need to create mathematic models that help operators, engineers and managers improve mill operation. These mathematical models are used to detect anomalies in the sensor or equipment functioning, to predict product quality with virtual sensors or to avoid unplanned stops by predicting upcoming machine failures. They also help process engineers identify how they can achieve certain process or product targets.Equally important aspects are metadata, data quality and granularity. Metadata is important because the data scientist will collaborate with the local domain experts to understand which process data might be relevant to realize a specific data analytics objective.The required data quality and granularity depends on the use case. If you want to be ready for any future use case it is better to use only lossless data compression like in TIPS Info, instead of using data historians with lossy data compression methods. For variables that need a higher sampling frequency than once per second, it is common practice to only store snapshots of the features in the long-term storage, rather than the raw signals themselves.History helps make future changesHistory data also helps cope with process changes and the introduction of new machinery, new devices and sensors. That information can be used as additional contextual information by the mathematical models or at least to help process engineers and data scientists understand the origin of changes in the process data. Significant process changes may be a good reason to delete old process data, but even then, the data could still be useful for certain objectives, for example, predictive maintenance of old equipment still used in the new process.Where and how to keep the data?TietoEVRY has a long partnership with MOPSsys, a company providing a state-of-the-art process historian database known as TIPS Info. The historical storage of time-based process data in combination with quality data and comments from operators is a gold mine for analysis tools such as AI. The value increases with the amount of data, the length of history, and the capability to explain the data with good descriptions.The AI value is not the only value, though. TIPS Info includes numerous functions for ad hoc analysis and drilling down to root causes. This will give the production team faster feedback from data with more exact KPIs and better decision support to reduce waste and meet quality targets.Retaining process data in systems is as important as maintaining the human know-how that operators have accumulated over the years. Just as the operator expertise comes from working at the mill for years, the AI model can learn the “normal” and “abnormal” conditions of the process by learning from past data. To achieve this, you need process data from a long-enough period and in enough detail.TietoEVRY’s world-class mill execution system TIPS industry solutions and services has now AI capabilities included. The new concept is called “TIPS AI”.", Heikki  Taskinen  ,Data , 3.2.2021
Top 10 trends impacting Wealth Management in 2021,/en/blog/2021/02/top-10-trends-impacting-wealth-management-in-2021/,Data / Sameer Datye / 2.2.2021,"Normally, trends don’t dramatically change in short intervals. However, last year was certainly special. Be it the impact of the pandemic or the ideological/political disparity becoming more pronounced, the societal impact on the trends is certainly bigger than the changes in industry or technology. Let's examine briefly the top 10 trends in this blog. I will drill-down into them in follow-up articles in more details.Top 10 trends impacting wealth management in 2021 on Societal, Technology & Industry dimensions:1.  Goal-based investingCommoditisation of investment advice, beating market benchmarks is passé. Wealth management is now holistic, goals-based and performance oriented aimed at achieving clients’ goals within agreed timeframes.Read the blog post where Sameer deep dives into Goal-based investing2.  Sustainable investingSustainable investing has moved away over the year from being a fad to a clear trend. Compliance update in EU (MiFID II, Solvency II, IDD, UCITS & AIMFD) will lead to Eco Labelling Framework by Q4 2021. Furthermore, disclosure regulation as well as Taxonomy regulation will continue to be implemented in steps. The societal impact of investing (application of ESG - Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) is already becoming an integral part of core portfolio management strategy.3.  Demographic transitionA change of guard from the old to the new is happening. Mandates (Advisory relations) and well as portfolios (inheritance) are transitioning from the older generation to the younger. With $68 trillions of Great Wealth Transfer well underway, the investor is changing. Ageing and retiring wealth advisory experts are leaving behind a shortfall that (hopefully) will be supported by technology.4.  Extreme personalisationModel portfolio allocation will not be enough. Investors will demand advice that is highly customised to suit specific needs, goals and ambitions. This is the result of growing awareness of the investors as well as availability of technology accelerators to make this happen.5.  Democratization of investingThe democratisation trend should not be viewed from the perspective of emergence of the retail investor alone. The instrument universe itself is expanding and allowing non-traditional opportunities - digital tokens, wine, art etc.Read Sameer's blog post dedicated to Democratization of wealth6.  Disruption by technologyThe technological disruption wave – the usual culprits – analytics, data mining, data advisory, digitalisation, access to huge databanks through custom APIs etc. As technology facilitates distribution disruption, it goes without saying that the pressure on fees/margins will continue to escalate.7.  Unique economic paradigmA unique economic combination of low or negative interest rates, government infused liquidity, high debt, low growth, pandemic impact, trade wars bringing in a plethora of challenges and uncertainties.8.  Convergence and competitionThere is now a continued convergence of brokerage and private banking models to serve affluent business clients. Robo advisories have brought in technology driven disruption in the competitive landscape.9.  Security and compliance challengesIncreased technological penetration has resulted in handling a unique set of security challenges and increasingly stringent compliance requirements. New and broader frameworks covering business practices as well as technology utilisation are evolving to protect the citizens and ensure business continuity at the same time.10.  Advent of the underservedMany underserved market segments, for e.g. women, are now being increasingly targeted with special customised offerings. The pandemic brought a bunch of 1st time investors to the market. So did the meteoric rise of the bitcoin phenomena- especially after serious institutional investors adding digital currencies to their portfolios.Learn more about the underserved segments in this blog postThese, I believe, will be the trends that will dominate 2021. Some may have a stronger run than others.  In the follow-up blogs in this series, each of these mega-trends will be examined in more details. Let's also touch base on the possible strategies to cope and benefit from these trends.---At TietoEVRY we support our Financial Services customers with full-stack Capital Markets and Digital Insurance & Wealth Solutions.

Time to replace your card payments platform? Don’t do it!,/en/blog/2020/08/dont-just-replace-a-card-platform-with-a-new-card-platform-deliver-a-completely-new-experience-for-your-customers-instead/,Digitalization / Edgars Bremze  / 29.1.2021,"If you are going to replace your legacy systems – which, at some point, you are going to, if you want to remain competitive – then it’s time to think about new payment instruments that focus on the customer experience. In our experience, a modern, innovative payment system will allow you to explore new revenue streams, provide flexible payment methods for card and account holders, and ensure merchants receive payments quickly.Old systems are for older timesLet’s face it, old systems were built for another payment environment. Product lifecycle lasted for years and card lifecycle management was key back then. Now you can issue single purpose payment product with lifecycle length of single transaction.Now it’s much about cloudification. About strong customer authentication, like 3DS v2 is now the de facto authentication standard for card e-comm transactions. The plastic card is being superseded by tokens that offer greater security as transactions are made from wallets and in apps. Despite the fact that many new payment methods are still built upon card rails, we see the increased development also for account based payment products. Not surprisingly, legacy systems are simply not designed to handle these. And this is the situation we found ourselves in today, technology is moving forward rapidly.The future is openWe are seeing how AI and machine learning are changing the landscape and opening up new exciting avenues that should be leveraged. Your system should be capable of integrating this. Previously, everything was kept physically in the bank – nowadays, new customers and service applications come from mobile and third parties. Open banking is becoming the norm, and your system needs to be flexible enough to adjust to this.Change is inevitableChange, of course, must start from within. ‘Cards’ can no longer be the sole responsibility of a cards department. At many of our customers we see that it has now become an interdisciplinary function, spread across departments including credit products, client service, payments, regulatory compliance, fraud management. Even further – end user product or service are built up based on your product, add on with some fintech features and card schemas services.Fast and API based product and compliance requirements won’t perform efficiently on a monolith system. You need gather flexibility with cloud ready and microservices based approach. To compete with Neo-banks and fintechs you need to stay with them on same starting line and on same shape -without huge legacy portfolio on your back.To do’s for successSo, let’s take a look at some of the to do’s for success. Based on our experience you shouldn’t simply replace a card platform with a card platform. But you should change the thinking, by that we mean evaluate what needs to be in the new system from your product portfolio and more importantly your customers’ needs. Choose a proven partner that will take a collaborative approach and help you drive business development. Migrate to a modern system step by step. Don’t change everything at once, keep the old products on the old system, but build the new platform for a new product pipeline. And finally, capture ‘low hanging fruit opportunities’ in the first months of development by releasing minimal viable products that appeal to customers.Related blogs:The AI OpportunityBringing lost revenues back to the cards business via credit servicesThe Fintech dilemma: how to evaluate and collaborate to bring added value to the cards businessLearn more on Card and financial product management related blog and insight series, case studies and more - click here.", Edgars Bremze  ,Digitalization , 29.1.2021
Time to have a look at the over-the-top players in the Telecom industry,/en/blog/2021/01/digitalizing-the-telco/,Digitalization / Rune Eide / 28.1.2021,"New competitors are more global than the traditional operators, with critics to their approach questioning whether they will be able to offer compelling enough services to the market, and whether they’ll be able to yield a good enough ROI as fast as the business usually demands.The new competition’s answer to this challenge usually lies in its agile approach, making it possible for them to utilize a minimal viable product strategy to be relevant in the market, basing it on Cloud native technology. Many of the more traditional operators have yet to adopt this culture, the processes and skillsets, making it harder to keep up the demand for a dynamic product mix. To put it more simply, we see a big cultural challenge, where the waterfall-based thinking of network and service evolution needs to give way for a more agile and customer-oriented operations.In the whitepaper Digitalizing the Telco, we’ve explored how operators can embrace the shift, and thereby go from losing market shares to the over-the-top players and hyper-scalers to stealing their tricks.

From virtual world to real life,/en/blog/2021/01/from-virtual-world-to-real-life/,Meet our people / Erik Eggen / 28.1.2021,"“Matthew developed a prototype for monitoring an oil platform in the North Sea. This was a progressive web application with a graphical user interface for both mobile, tablet and PC. The customer was so impressed that they wanted a finished product,” says Roger Johannessen, Head of Application Innovation in TietoEVRY.Matthew was born and raised in England, but moved to Porsgrunn in Norway, joining TietoEVRY three and a half years ago. He has a background as a freelance game developer for several British and American gaming companies.“It was a bit of a contrast to go from virtual world to real life. It's nice to work with something that is real and makes a difference,” Matthew says with a smile.As a game developer, he did not know that real life was far more exciting and challenging.“The gaming industry is linear and has done much of the same for 15 years. That's not the case in business. Here you have to familiarize yourself with the customer's challenges and new technology all the time, says Matthew, highlighting the fast-changing environment as the main reason why he chose to work for TietoEVRY.Tomas Syversen, Architect and UX designer agrees with Roger and are very happy to have Matthew in the team.“His role has expanded significantly in a short time. Matthew has been given more and more responsibility. He started with mobile development, but has now also become an important contributor to integration,"" says Roger.And the three technologists also agree that the combination of young talent and seasoned developers.“We do not necessarily want only people with long experience. We also want young people who are hungry and willing to learn!""  Thomas says enthusiastically.Matthew, for his part, appreciates the invaluable knowledge experienced staff hold.“There are people in the team who have worked with programming longer than I have lived. They have been here since the birth of programming,"" laughs Matthew.“It is remarkable! And senior members of the team notice things that we young developers can quickly overlook in our search for the new and exciting,"" he adds.It is all about seeing the big picture and finding the right solutions. And that's exactly why teamwork is important.“Some may have expertise in databases, others in mobile development, user interface and web standards. The combination of different competencies is absolutely crucial to be the best in technology.""“But,"" Roger points out, ""technology only has value if the team is able to understand the customer's challenges and find smart ways to solve these, so that we add real business value.”A roller coasterIt is no secret that the technology industry is challenging at times. What was new yesterday may be out of date tomorrow.“As a technologist, you can explore new technology all the time. That's what's so cool!"" Matthew says.", Erik Eggen ,Meet our people , 28.1.2021
Hans Kristian made the entire system for the Directorate of Fisheries Cloud Native,/en/blog/2021/01/hans-kristian-made-the-entire-system-for-the-directorate-of-fisheries-cloud-native/,Meet our people / Erik Eggen / 28.1.2021,"So it was with great enthusiaism that Hans Kristian embarked on his first project for TietoEVRY: to renew the computer systems – in some cases several generations old – for Norway’s Directorate of Fisheries, which oversees Norway’s fishing and aquaculture industry.“It was a challenging project,” he admits.A bet on an emerging technologyBack in 2017, and just a week into his new role at TietoEVRY, Hans Kristian set off to the Directorate.The goal was to build a platform for all self-developed applications, from registers, professional systems, and websites, to self-service solutions for users.“My big idea was to create a modern common platform for over 100 applications so that we could get control of everything. In addition, the platform would need to accommodate new things that come up.”The solution was to build a container-based platform based on Kubernetes. At the time, Kubernetes was emerging as an important technology, but it was still some way away from being declared the de facto standard in container orchestration software.“I took a chance on Kubernetes. We also considered Mesos or Docker Swarm, but that was simply because I believed this would be the standard. Luckily, I was right!”Within six months, Hans Kristian and a small team of developers had turned their pilot project into a full-fledged platform for the directorate. Rather aptly, they named it DockYard.If you want to take a deep dive into exactly what this entails, you can watch Hans Kristian explain in detail about DockYard in this video from the Booster conference.“This is a great project,” he says. “We have changed the entire regime for how everything in the Directorate of Fisheries is put into production. From day one and how it is set up, but also that everything should be automated. Today, colleagues Martin Tverråen and Stian Haugland manage the platform.”DockYard has formed much of the basis for TietoEVRY’s investment in container-based development. An ambitious project started by a new TietoEVRY employee a few years ago has now been taken further in the company, and there are teams working on this in Stavanger, Trondheim, and Bergen.“Among other things, it has been used in Sparebanken Vest's new mobile bank Bulder Bank, where TietoEVRY is in charge of the cloud, infrastructure, and automation,” says Hans Kristian.Knowledge work requires professional guiding starsAs a strong proponent of the approach, it is not surprising that Hans Kristian wanted the platform to embody a DevOps mindset. Out with waterfalls and silos, and in with agile processes.“Several organizations have opened their eyes to this, and we are unable to meet the demand. We have now received acceptance for a separate training program for DevOps and containers,” he says.TietoEVRY is one of the few companies in the Nordic region that has a formalized training program in DevOps, which ends in a DevOps certification in either Azure, AWS or Google Cloud.Hans Kristian ended up as a DevOps Practice Lead because he himself wanted this role and received acceptance from the closest leaders. When asked if this is typical at TietoEVRY, he nods.“In the short time I have worked in TietoEVRY, there has been a lot of development within the company. There is room to find out who you want to be or what your area of expertise should be. You get backing to go the way you want, but you must take the steps yourself!”", Erik Eggen ,Meet our people , 28.1.2021
Here you get to work with state-of-the-art technology,/en/blog/2021/01/here-you-get-to-work-with-state-of-the-art-technology/,Meet our people / Erik Eggen / 28.1.2021,"“You get new challenges all the time, at the same time we do not know where the technology will be six months ahead, so new opportunities and solutions will constantly open up. Here you can really be whatever you want,” says Arnab Datta, Competence lead for Java.Frode Rislå is Arnab's colleague and leads the professional group for Microsoft 365, in addition to being employed as a consultant and solution architect.Together with Frode Rislå, Arnab can tell more about how TietoEVRY is investing even more in competence development and a varied working day for its employees.Keep learningWorking in the leading IT company in the Nordics, it is important to stay up to date on the latest in technology - all the time. That is why TietoEVRY invests heavily in continuous learning through courses, ""hands-on workshops"", concept development, and most of all in its own learning communities.In Norway, they have 6 main consulting practices with 45 learning communities within these again and about 1200 Norwegian employees are involved. Several of the learning communities are also Nordic.“My main task as a community lead is to contribute to the entire community. I collaborate with several with the same professional background as me in the Nordics. We run mostly monthly network meetings on topics that are relevant to the Nordic region and often involve people who give presentations from the global Microsoft 365 practice for experience sharing,” says Frode.Within the Microsoft community, there are again many subgroups you can get involved in, for example, the Microsoft Power Platform group. You can even create a new professional group if you have the commitment to implement it.Frode says that they set aside a lot of time internally to update themselves on different topics. Compliance and security have received greater attention from customers, especially with increasing use of Microsoft Teams and collaboration across companies and with employees' home offices. By using Teams collaboration, cooperation, professional work and customer dialogue all work very well.“We tend to say that we always have enough learning activity in TietoEVRY to fill a classroom every day,” all day.“The professional development is based on the employees' own commitment. It is not a requirement, but it is quite common that the employees are very engaged in what they do and set aside time in their free time for further education, take courses and generally want to spend their free time testing things out. It is a good way to stay up to date,” Frode believes.In addition, he highlights ""hands-on workshops"".“These workshops often involve us setting aside a few hours to learn something new, whether we code, develop something, learn a new tool. There are simply workshops where we test new things together,” he says.Here you can become whatever you wantBoth Frode and Arnab agree that one of the things you really gain from being in a large company is the opportunities internally. Do not thrive where you are? Change department, then!“Some are employed here in one type of position, but find that there is actually another type of work you are more interested in. Then TietoEVRY is very open for you to move, to a new professional group, a new department, a new project and a new direction. Yes, whatever it may be,” says Frode.Arnab Datta, Competence lead for Java.Arnab agrees.“You get the opportunity to test different roles. For example, I had different types of developers, team leaders, and community lead, but basically, I am a consultant who focuses on helping the customer. You eventually get good at many things from working here,” he thinks.In addition, Arnab Datta is also the leader of the learning community for Java. They focus on everything in development, everything from language and technologies to backend and frontend. At a gathering about Kotlin, 85 participated in Teams, so even though we are now in home offices, there is still is very good participation and great interest in different topics and new technology.We run monthly sessions in the Java group and a monthly TechLunch for Technology professionals and a number of other professional activities and sessions. In addition, we have access to almost unlimited e-learning offerings of courses and hands-on training that makes it easy to stay up to date. We are constantly working to stay a little ahead and look a lot at future technologies. If you are stuck, there are good colleagues who can help just a few keystrokes away on Slack, says Arnab.“Is the goal that everyone in TietoEVRY should know something about everything?”“Both yes and no. If you are happy with what you do and enjoy it, then it is great. But we want you to stay up to date on technology and be able to look outside your own zone as well. It is important to be able to deliver holistically to the customer,” says Arnab.Being part of a large company obviously gives you the opportunity to try things out, and can also open new doors you did not expect.“The possibilities are many and you are not locked into an area. New areas you did not know you were interested in may appear, which suddenly become a passion. Here you can really be whatever you want,” Arnab thinks.“The most important thing is that you are interested in technology and think it's fun. We are many here who look forward to work every single day,” says Frode.People are always the main focusThe community leads can tell that there are exciting times ahead for the company.“The management has a strong focus on competence development. Now our learning environment is gaining more and more momentum,” says Arnab enthusiastically.“And it is precisely the breadth of our learning communities that is one of our great strengths. We have so many talented people, we are so big and have talented people in all disciplines. That is where our strength lies,” he adds.Frode agrees.“The people and knowledge we have gathered are what make TietoEVRY what it is today. That is why it is incredibly important for us to take care of our people, they are the heart of the company.”“What is the plan ahead for your learning communities?”“For our part, we will immerse ourselves more in AI and machine learning, eg. the AI ​​RPA part of the Power Platform since we see that there is increasing interest among customers for automation and optimization. We will also drive very hard forward in areas that focus on information security,” says Frode on behalf of the Microsoft group.For the Java group, continuous updating on new technology will be in focus, Arnab can announce.“There will generally be more subjects, simpler interdisciplinary collaboration across departments and countries and greater investments in TietoEVRY in the future, we are entering a very exciting time,” he concludes.", Erik Eggen ,Meet our people , 28.1.2021
Time to enhance Edge IoT security – from devices to people and processes,/en/blog/2021/01/three-ways-to-enhance-edge-iot-security/,Cloud / Vinh Quang Nguyen / 27.1.2021,"IoT security challenges in emerging technologiesBy 2025, analysts predict that the Internet of things (IoT) will cover roughly 20 billion connected devices. The new emerging technology is becoming a reality everywhere – from Industry 4.0 to autonomous vehicles roaming the open road. This is changing how enterprises collect, exchange, analyze and extrapolate vast amounts of data to gather insights on essentially everything. From understanding consumer behavior and improving business efficiencies to reducing operational costs and enhancing overall workplace safety, IoT data is enabling organizations to do more.The scale of IoT is unprecedented – but so are the cybersecurity threats it leaves open. The surface area for attacks has expanded dramatically over the last decade, with unprotected, unpatchable gadgets that have given cybercriminals the opportunity to hack, compromise and control devices.Vulnerable connected devices have been exploited to attack national state surveillance, to bring down some of the biggest websites, including PayPal, Spotify and Twitter via DDOS attacks (Mirai), and to paralyze one fifth of the world’s shipping capacity using ransomware (NotPetya). The future holds many new threats and Gartner predicts that, by 2022, IoT security attacks due to lack of insight into edge and third-party device providers will increase by 35%. (Source: Gartner: Predicts 2019: Infrastructure Services. Updated on April 2020, published Dec 2018.)When companies embark upon their IoT journey, they soon realize there is no silver bullet nor one-time effort to make IoT devices completely safe. However, we believe there are three important security approaches companies need to consider to mitigate the risks.1. Prevent security breaches by enhancing IoT device securitySecuring endpoints is essential because the attack surface grows with each new deployment. Unlike phones and computers, which are often regarded as secure and trusted, IoT devices are more challenging to protect. IoT assets range across a huge variety of different types of non-standard devices with limited on-board security capabilities. These devices are often shipped with vulnerabilities and might not be supported with new patches from vendors throughout the intended device lifecycle, allowing hackers to launch inconspicuous attacks. For companies to secure IoT devices, there are some best practices organizations must employ:Security hygiene – Inadequate employee security routines account for a large chunk of security breaches. In fact, 50% of security breaches are caused mainly or partly by human error according to Næringslivet sikkerhetsråd’s survey. IoT devices are no exception, but many of these breaches can be mitigated by creating solid security hygiene routines.Maintain a list of approved IoT devices and enforce cybersecurity policies to block unsecure new devices from networks.  
Continuously update firmware and software, remove end-of-life devices that are not receiving new updates and build in security policies.  
Turn off devices that are not actively in use to reduce the window of time in which they can be hacked.IoT Blind spots – Unmanaged devices in networks have been expanding vulnerable blind spots, as it is difficult to defend networks without visibility into these devices. To decrease this risk, companies should separate the main network from the IoT network in order to isolate these devices and ensure comprehensive visibility of the corporate network.2. Understand data and apply data protectionResearch from Zscaler shows that 91.5 % of transactional data from IoT devices contained plaintext, which means that hackers could intercept, read and manipulate unencrypted data – and then send it back unnoticed. Therefore, protecting the physical device that stores and processes data is just one part of preventing cybercriminals from obtaining sensitive data. The other part is about protecting the data journey, when data is at-rest, in-transit or in-use across the different entities in the IoT value chain. This means that all parties involved in the value chain must ensure intruders cannot observe and manipulate data – thus avoiding the possibly fatal outcomes of these breaches. Just consider the consequences of security lapses for sensitive applications like heart monitors in healthcare and self-driving cars when securing data across all its stages. Here are some simple pro-active steps to take to keep data safe:Understanding the data – The first step to securing data is to understand the nature of the data, including what is important and sensitive information, before identifying who does and does not have access.Encrypt everything – To secure the data journey, an encrypt everything approach is necessary. End-to-end data encryption makes it difficult to extract information, even when device security fails, because the data would still be unreadable. However, it is important to consider the limited resources of devices and use tailored encryption tools.Track and trace – The last step is to protect networks through strong authentication and establish protocols for tracking the source of any changes to relevant data.3. Take a holistic approach to IoT security (people, process and technology)Securing devices and the data itself is just part of the equation. To secure the whole IoT solution, companies must strive for a holistic approach to security that accounts for technologies, people and processes. There are some key approaches to consider when securing end-to-end IoT solutions:End-to-end ecosystem security – the IoT security environment must be managed and orchestrated both horizontally (device to end-user service) and vertically (hardware to applications), and this includes the ecosystem of collaborators like device manufacturers, network providers, platform providers, app developers and end-users.Organizational alignment of IoT security – The ownership and responsibility of the different parts of the IoT value chain can be quite scattered, so the dilemma of who is accountable for what naturally arises. For manufacturing companies IoT solution can for example involve an OT operational group, the IT department and the security department, each of which separately owns tools and processes to manage security. This can result in a siloed approach to security, with data seen out of context and complex internal processes. There are multiple ways for organizations to achieve alignment around security:Get rid of data silos – gather and contextualize data into a single reliable source. 
 Apply real-time analysis, AIOps and automation to reveal insight and predict and prevent breaches. 
Integrate workflows across departments to effectively utilize real-time information.ConclusionAs IoT mass-adoption is yet to come, many companies are still in a great position to prepare and undertake continuous efforts to combat threats. These efforts will demand a focus on people, processes, and new security technologies.Contact us to enhance your edge IoT security.", Vinh Quang Nguyen ,Cloud , 27.1.2021

At the same time, power generation from renewable sources is gathering momentum. Because of renewable generation, we need more shift of electricity usage – and electricity storages, that is, batteries.Could we connect the dots by using car batteries as part of the electricity system, and, to help EV penetration, compensate owners when allowing access to their batteries to the electricity system? This means that citizens are paid for making their asset available for a common target.Is there a solution to make that happen? Yes, there is.EVs have the potential to become a core electricity grid balance tool, as the energy system can be balanced with controlling the charging. Cars can balance the supply and demand of electricity, and feed energy back to the grid. This is called vehicle-to-grid technology, V2G.Many cars are already equipped with features for V2G, and there are more to come. This would be a win-win-win case in the climate-government-citizen chain.Small sacrifice for big gainsThe increasing popularity of electric vehicles provides a viable solution to electricity storage problems. The more there are EVs, the more there is storage capacity – tens of thousands of storage units around the country working as distributed energy resources. A high enough number of EVs can be charged and balance grid during low-consumption periods when renewable electricity is available and the price is low. When consumption is peaking, batteries can be discharged, thereby avoiding the use of fossil production.The battery capacity of EVs presently on the world market is nearing 60 kWh and increasing all the time. This is enough to power a detached house inhabited by a family of four even in the cold climate of northern Europe for 24 hours. Only a small amount of electricity needs to be drawn from each EV to achieve a significant contribution to matching peak consumption.From government subsidies to market-driven incentivesThe European Green Deal calls for investment of 1 trillion euros in environmental measures such as switching customers to zero-emission vehicles, raising questions on whether spending should now be reprioritized to help economies recover from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.The solution is described above. Charging EVs when electricity is cheap and discharging them when consumption and prices peak could fundamentally change the present system of incentives. Instead of government-funded EV purchase subsidies or tax breaks, the distributed energy solution introduces a totally market-driven funding model.When an EV owner joins a service run by their electricity sales company, or a loyalty programme of a retail chain, or someone else, they can be rewarded for allowing their EV battery to be used as an energy resource. “When I allow my car to be used in the electricity market, I’m rewarded.”Required: a capable energy management systemHow to manage this kind of system? To handle large numbers of distributed energy resources such as EV batteries, a capable management system is a must.TietoEVRY's Distributed Energy Solution (DES) is designed to manage gigantic volumes. It combines millions of electricity devices into a virtual power plant. Delivered as a service from the cloud, it scales with virtually no limits.", Matti  Seppänen  ,Sustainability , 26.1.2021
Do you find card authentication a headache? Time to make it a part of the customer experience then.,/en/blog/2020/09/cut-the-inconvenience.-make-authentication-a-part-of-the-customer-experience/,Digitalization / Yevhen  Miechev / 21.1.2021,"In part this has been driven by the International Card Organizations (ICO) which wanted to ensure the same security measures were applied no matter if a transaction was made at a bricks and mortar store or through an online merchant.However, in our experience, security has rarely been viewed from a customer-centric perspective. Generally, the more emphasis that is put on the security, the poorer user experience becomes. 3-D Secure V2 is changing this by facilitating secure and frictionless payment processing, putting the customer first.Better security for all actors3DS v2 essentially forces merchants to request strong customer authentication and ensures issuers provide it with the ability to apply various exemptions which is especially important under PSD2 SCA regulations. This brings benefits to all the actors of the payment process. Issuers receive assurances that the real cardholder has made the purchase, merchants can minimize fraudulent activity and banks meet regulatory requirements.Security-based user experienceToday, we believe it makes complete sense for banks to implement 3DS v2. Beyond meeting regulations, transactions are faster, with fewer steps in the purchase process for consumers, while security is strengthened.With 3DS v2 you can utilize which ever authentication method you wish. The only condition here is that it should ensure the strong customer authentication requirements. It does not matter if it’s a one-time code with some adoptions, biometric authentication or something else. The customer will accept it if it’s convenient and easy.For yet further user-centric security, the latest version of 3DS v2 enhances the opportunity to provide less friction during authentication by adding support of transactions risk scoring, merchant whitelisting and delegated authentication capability.  Our experience shows that issuers and acquirers are not yet ready to support these features. They see the implementation of 3DS v2 more as a mandatory thing pushed by international card organizations and PSD2 SCA requirements in Europe rather than possibility to enhance user experience for card not present transactions. But this will change going forward. We estimate around 2/3 of our customers  are thinking how to enhance the user experience after 3DS v2 implementation and take advantage of all the opportunities it offers. It definitely should be on the agenda for all the participants for 2021.Authentication and risk appetiteThe way we see it, such functionality should be viewed in combination with card schemes chargeback rules. The risk appetite of a bank or issuer will also have an impact on this, i.e. how much risk is an issuer willing to take to ensure a frictionless customer journey, and in that sense not require the cardholder to provide additional authentication.At the end of the day – it’s about the customer experience vs the level of security and convenience vs inconvenience for consumers.Related blogsBringing lost revenues back to the cards business via credit servicesA digital card experience for a more profitable futureTokenization: the secure way to support merchants, consumers and IoT paymentsLearn more on Card and financial product management related blog and insight series, case studies and more - click here.", Yevhen  Miechev ,Digitalization , 21.1.2021
There’s no time to be complacent,/en/blog/2021/01/theres-no-time-to-be-complacent/,Cybersecurity insights / Sigrun Hansen Bock / 15.1.2021,"A surge in remote working has introduced new vulnerabilities for cyber attackers to exploit, while growing e-commerce means there’s much more of our personal data online to protect. But the biggest risk to our security might well be our own complacency amid this changing threat environment.Generally, digital trust runs high across the Nordic region.The results from our recent survey, the TietoEVRY Security Barometer, bear out that view.However, our survey also reveals that there’s still lots of room for improvement. For example, three out of ten Swedish respondents said that they’d been refraining from online shopping out of a fear of being hacked. And in Norway, half of respondents were sceptical that private companies process their data in a satisfactory way.Such findings are concerning and they underscore the need for digital service providers to step up their efforts to protect their business, their employees and users.Organizations will do well to start by looking to understand their digital risks. Are you baking security into the design of your product right from the start? How do you handle security from a governance, risk and compliance perspective? Are you applying today’s security best practices? And last but not least, is security widely understood across your organization?At the end of the day, humans are the weakest link in your defences. Even the most effective technology defences for thwarting a cyberattack can easily be undone by a simple case of human error. Awareness training for all staff should therefore be an ongoing exercise, with everyone made aware that they each have a part to play in maintaining informational security.All this applies just as much to public sector entities as it does to private businesses. According to our survey, the majority of respondents in Finland, Sweden and Norway would vote digitally in their next parlamentary election, if offered the option to do so. This reminds me of just how fortunate we are to live in societies where e-democacy is even possible. But it also underlines how we must not rest on our laurels: digital trust is continuously evolving through people’s experiences and can be taken away as easily as it is given.Fortunately, there are lots of actions you can take to strengthen your security processes and nurture the digital trust that is vital for business growth. Every day, we in TietoEVRY help our customers within the private and public sector to ensure that their services and solutions are safe to use.

The technology predictions you need to know for 2021,/en/blog/2021/01/the-technology-predictions-you-need-to-know-for-2021/,Cloud / Marius Sandbu / 15.1.2021,"This moment made me reflect a bit on what is going on in the market and the future of technology in the year ahead. I also started looking back at what vendors have been working on in the last year, which provides a bit of insight about where they want to take us as customers.So what do I see? Well, from a technology standpoint, organizations are moving in many directions, so I want to highlight some of the key trends. Of course, many are already far ahead in the areas below, but many haven’t even started.1 Modern workplace allows employees to efficiently work from anywhereIn 2020, a lot of organizations were plagued by ransomware attacks, vulnerabilities and the WFH shift specifically because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of these have pushed organizations to think differently about, first, how to provide employees with remote access to services and, second, how they should manage staff.In 2021, more organizations will likely shift to modern workplaces where devices are internet managed, using Azure AD and cloud-based services to provide access for their employees to work from anywhere on any device. Importantly, this requires changes to the way organizations deliver applications – they need a web-based approach instead of a traditional Windows-based delivery model.More and more services are moving towards using OAuth or SAML, which are both supported directly by Azure Active Directory, and organizations should assess the ability of end-users to access their applications in a simple and secure way.2 Software-defined data centers provide ease of management and simplify scalabilityWhile COVID has driven many companies to use Public Cloud solutions to scale their services properly, quite a few also invested in Private Clouds to provide even better scalability and self-healing data centers.Microsoft is, of course, investing in more software-defined or hyperconverged infrastructure with their new offering Azure Stack HCI, but Nutanix and VMware still remain far ahead. Both provide software-defined storage and networking services in combination with a wide range of automation possibilities and even public cloud integrations.In 2021, more organizations should shift from a 3-tier architecture to software-defined solutions in order to provide better ease-of-management, facilitate scale-out and enable more automation possibilities.3 Zero-Trust based security architecture reduces the risk of ransomware attacksAs mentioned, 2020 revealed an unprecedented level of (high risk) vulnerabilities from many of the largest security vendors in the market, including a high level of ransomware attacks, which are still exploiting legacy protocols and services such as SMB and Active Directory. Often, these attacks started at the endpoint either using drive-by download or phishing attacks.Many security vendors are responding by pushing solutions that use a “Zero-Trust” approach, where a device or a user doesn’t have access to anything before its risk level is evaluated. That can be done by collecting risk information from the user, device and/or action.In 2021, more organizations should shift to a zero-trust based security architecture to limit these ransomware attacks and to better support the transition to a modern workplace.4 Multi-Cloud and Cloud NativeAs widely predicted, many companies have been moving to multi public cloud ecosystems, where organizations can use services from many public cloud vendors. This can put a lot of strain on organizations, in terms of people, processes and technology. At the same time, such combinations of services can be used to provide the best ecosystems.Product vendors are also creating their own products to support “multi-cloud” ecosystems aimed at security, monitoring and automation. However, most of these products are not 100% compatible with any single cloud provider, so customers that use multi-cloud products lose access to recent innovations.I hope that organizations focus on maintaining and managing each cloud as its own ecosystem in 2021, instead of using so-called multi-cloud products.(NOTE: Some multi-cloud tooling does make sense, like using automation tools like Pulumi or Terraform.)5 New Hybrid Services and Edge Cloud offeringsOne increasing trend is that the big cloud providers like Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services are investing heavily in providing cloud services either through edge computing or within customer data centers. This means more and more standard services that can replace other third-party services.For example, AWS Outposts provides a full rack of AWS managed servers in combination with AWS services such as S3 through edge computing. (I’m confident this will be able to compete with other storage vendors in the market and also provide better ease of management.) Then, we also have PaaS offerings such as Amazon RDS, Azure Arc and Google Anthos.In 2021, we will likely see more of these services becoming available to customers and an increase in customer adoption of these services where it makes sense.6 Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) can optimize customer networksMore employees are working from home to access services, and offices are becoming more loosely defined because work can happen anywhere. Combined with the adoption of cloud-based services, these factors have required an organization to change how their networks function and how employees access services securely.This is where Secure Access Service Edge comes in. SASE essentially describes providing both security and optimization of the network. There are already many vendors claiming to provide a SASE product stack, often as a product suite consisting of 4 main components:Cloud Access Security Broker
Secure Web Gateway
Zero-Trust Network Access
Firewall as a serviceSASE is also a key part of a zero-trust based network in combination with adopting SaaS-based cloud services and a modern workplace. In recent years, many traditional network vendors have acquired SD-WAN vendors. To enhance their capabilities, Aruba acquired Silver Peak and VMware acquired VeloCloud, and both are continuing to filling gaps to provide SASE-based product offerings.While many organizations will likely adopt similar SASE portfolios to optimize and secure their services, I hope customers will spend time evaluating the different vendors in the market. This is especially important as many vendors are now just name dropping SASE in marketing slides, so make sure you are considering the right vendor (or combination of vendors).7 AIOps introduced into OperationsI’ve previously written about AIOps and how you can see it as a way to achieve more optimized operations. The adoption of cloud services makes service more dispersed, which leaves you more vulnerable to outages. Thus, your cloud services can fail because of dependencies on your ISP, Network, Cloud Provider or application stack. In 2021, many organizations are expected to enhance their monitoring capabilities with AIOps (or ML) based enhancements to their operations to act as “noise” filters and to simplify finding the root cause of service failures.We will also likely see an increase in AIOps tooling (or vendors claming to do AIOps), and most organizations should be considering where to put the AIOps functionality – on the monitoring side, as part of the ITSM product stack or in between?8 Automation for everyoneIn recent years, there has been much work done with typical RPA tooling like Blue Prism and UIPath (and others) with all cloud vendors now adding no-code / low-code capabilities into their portfolio with services such as AWS Honeycode, Azure Power Automate, Microsoft Flow and Google Cloud AppSheet.There has also been the introduction of many new third-party platforms that provide most employees with the ability to create their own automation runbooks or workflows using this built-in functionality. These solutions still leave much of the heavy lifting to be done with RPA tooling (or as an addition of existing workflows)In 2021, these types of ecosystems/services should be introduced into organizations in order to enable employees to focus on building automation instead of leaving that to be done by an RPA team. In short, more organizations should benefit from employees automating their own workflows.Working with technology is a never-ending race to keep track of all the changes, technology trends and products that are being released.

Time to embrace customer-facing AI opportunities,/en/blog/2020/08/the-ai-opportunity--why-should-your-bank-start-embracing-customer-facing-ai-opportunities-today/,Digitalization / Micaela Vernmark / 15.1.2021,"Artificial Intelligence/ˌɑː.tɪ.fɪʃ.əl ɪnˈtel.ɪ.dʒəns/The study of how to produce machines that have some of the qualities that the human mind has, such as the ability to understand language, recognize pictures, solve problems and learn.AI in banking – The hyper-personalization of servicesIn recent times we have seen more and more banks, especially large ones like USAA and HSBC, use new technology to manage their operations. Not surprisingly, these banks are adopting AI to help them stay at the forefront of the game and ahead of the competition.Like them, we believe the applications for AI are endless within banking. For instance, analysis of customer patterns, such as spending and use of apps, combined with state-of-the-art data analytics – the so-called hyper-personalized offerings – opens up the potential for enormous customer product and card offering improvements. AI enabled chatbots can also support customers with many of their inquiries – saving time and resources. Beyond customer facing services, we have seen AI used to simplify back-office operations, improve Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, and monitor and prevent fraud.Slow AI adoption in customer-facing servicesWith that said, utilization of AI in banking and the financial sector has been slower than in many other industries, particularly on the consumer side of the business. In part, this can be put down to the inherent mistrust of AI among consumers, and indeed employees. Cases of biased algorithms, data hacking and privacy breaches, have all contributed to this. But in reality, today’s consumers are exposed to AI on a daily basis, most of the time without being fully aware of it.Changing attitudes to AINow, more than ever, the digital ecosystems and interactions are blurring, i.e. banking, texting, social media, online shopping, gaming, etc. And we can clearly see how this is driving changes. This is being further accelerated by the pandemic-triggered increase in digital adoption – whereby remote working and online shopping have become the norm for many more people – and attitudes towards AI have changed in line with this.If AI is to transform the payments industry – through the customization of services – in the way it has done for the communications and media industry, data must be leveraged and transformed into insights. This leaves us with two key aspects to consider:Quality. Not quantity. The data collected must be high-quality data, or at least be categorized suitably in order for it to be made sense of and utilized. Large volumes of data are worth nothing without intelligence.    
Ethics. An ethical line must be drawn between the moment AI ceases to enhance the customer experience and the moment it becomes intrusive. Banks will need to win the trust of customers and must act ethically.Putting a value of AI in bankingThe financial opportunity of AI in banking is hard to quantify. However, from the studies we have seen, the incremental potential could amount to hundreds of billions of USD. However, taking advantage of this requires investment. In our opinion, the full potential of AI will only open up to those banks that reimagine how they engage with customers, and that deploy new technologies and leverage customer data in an ethical, integrated way.AI a double-edged swordOf course, there is a caveat to implementing AI, which cannot be ignored. Implementing AI technology is not simple. As mentioned earlier, you need clean data, but you also need qualified people to deploy it. Qualified people who may fear that that they will be replaced by AI. But AI is here to stay, and these concerns must be dealt with if you are going to provide the optimal personalized experiences to your customers.Act nowAs a bank you need to ask: What are we trying to solve with AI and for whom? Are we ready to take this step? And can we afford to wait especially when digital giants and new agile players are entering the financial space with access to richer customer data?Related blogs:Don’t just replace a card platform with a new card platform, deliver a completely new experience for your customers insteadThe Fintech dilemma: how to evaluate and collaborate to bring added value to the cards businessWaterfall, agile, devops.

When sustainability meets digitalization – How Luke increases the impact of what they do.,/en/blog/2021/01/when-sustainability-meets-digitalization--how-luke-increases-the-impact-of-what-they-do/,Digitalization / Antti Seppälä / 14.1.2021,"What is Luke?Founded in 2015, Luke (short for Luonnonvarakeskus) is the National Resource Institute Finland. Acting under the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the organization researches alternatives to make better use of renewable natural resources. To that end, they provide sustainable solutions to solve food safety, sustainable agriculture, and forestry-related problems. Today, Luke employs 1300+ talented people and is involved in numerous international development projects, well beyond Finnish borders.A challenging journey towards a more sustainable worldHumanity is at a crossroads.Never before have we had so many means to precisely measure and understand the impact of our activities on the planet. Fortunately, our growing knowledge and overall awareness are greatly contributing to driving countries to find innovative and sustainable solutions to reduce their footprint.Yet, our impact and CO2 emissions have never been as critically high as they are now.Fortunately, our growing knowledge and overall awareness are greatly contributing to driving countries to find innovative and sustainable solutions to reduce their footprint. Never before have we had so many means to precisely measure and understand the impact of our activities on the planet.“We take more from the land than the land can actually supply - maybe less so from a Finland perspective, but it is the case from a global perspective.”
—John Kettle, Director of Sales and International Relations, Luke.John mentioned three key challenges that Luke and similar organizations around the globe are facing.Three sustainability challenges we need to solve1. Societal awarenessResearch keeps confirming that climate change is happening faster than expected around the globe because we aren’t doing enough.For this reason, part of Luke’s mission is to explore new paths to encourage people to consume more sustainably and reduce waste. That includes investigating and supporting actions towards developing more self-sufficient countries and responsibilize local populations’ consumption habits.Is it enough to change people’s mindset?John believes that we’re heading in the right direction, but that the speed is too slow and we also need to do a lot more to save what can still be saved.In fact, in most of the western world countries, inhabitants don’t realize how fast climate change is happening as they don’t witness its most severe manifestations themselves. As a result, our consumption behaviours are only slowly evolving on a global scale.“People don’t realize how fast global warming is happening, they don’t see the effects fast enough. When, at the same time, some populations have to cope with weather conditions we didn’t expect until 2100”.
—John Kettle, Director of Sales and International Relations, Luke.2. FundingBecause Luke isn’t a fully state-funded organization, John mentioned that “funding is always a challenge for organizations like ours … but it’s getting less of an issue as more funds are allocated for climate and biodiversity issues”.Public and private funding opportunities are closely tied to societal awareness. As the public is increasingly paying attention to environmental topics, governments and international organizations are doubling down on supporting sustainable initiatives.3. Political initiatives/courageThe third challenge comes from the actions and initiatives conducted by our leaders.Eventually, the masses will be driving the change. Until then, we need our elites to work together to enact change. This is why global initiatives such as the Paris Agreements (2015) are key for us to move faster towards more sustainable societies.What’s more, the recent global collaborations to find a cure against COVID-19 spark optimism for John.“Out of all the negative things related to the pandemic, you can see that progress can be made very rapidly when companies and governments come together. The overall willingness to move in one direction is important.”
—John Kettle, Director of Sales and International Relations, Luke.Using knowledge and facts to build a better tomorrowJohn and his colleagues at Luke are convinced that sharing knowledge based on undeniable facts is fundamental to support our fight towards building a better tomorrow.“It’s not about opinions. What we’re trying to do is having it all fact-based.“
—John Kettle, Director of Sales and International Relations, Luke.Fuel change through facts and knowledgeWith a great focus on climate change and circular bio-economy development, Luonnonvarakeskus contributes to increasing the understanding of our impact on the environment and brings solutions to mitigate it.One concrete illustration of Luke’s work is seen through how they support farmers with relevant, fact-based information to help them operate a sustainable, yet lucrative transition.Help farmers plan “what do to next”Milk farms are threatened by the yearly decrease of milk-based products consumption, as revealed by the latest “What was eaten in Finland” reports:Year

This is why such information is vital for them as they can slowly plan a transition towards products that are both a) high in demand and b) have a smaller environmental footprint.Another positive sign that Luke’s work contributes to changing mentalities is the attractivity of sustainable initiatives for young talent.Sustainability attracts young talentThe evolution of our behaviours is also seen through what job seekers look for and believe in.John reported that young jobseekers now prioritize what companies stand for above concrete benefits such as the offered salary. During the interview processes, it’s now common to have candidates asking questions such as “What is your company doing that’s sustainable?”, John added.“There’s a real swing towards working in the natural resources research field.”
—John Kettle, Director of Sales and International Relations, Luke.What’s more, Luke won first place as the Most Attractive Employer in natural science in 2020 both for professionals and for students.“TietoEVRY helps us to increase the impact of what we do”Driving change isn’t only about good intentions.In the 21st century, it requires a mastery of the latest technologies and communication methods. To put it another way, the more light Luonnonvarakeskus gets, the more knowledge it can spread.This is something that TietoEVRY has been supporting John and his colleagues at Luke with.Leverage digitalization to be more efficientLuke’s workforce has been delivering invaluable studies for many years now. Their professionalism, work ethics, and overall understanding of the great challenges we’re facing contribute to making it one of the most renowned organizations to fuel sustainable change around the globe.What they were lacking, however, was a comprehensive set of skills, tools, and processes to better position and market their expertise and, therefore, increase the impact of what they do to build a better tomorrow.TietoEVRY supported teams at Luonnonvarakeskus with:Defining a clear value proposition development to present their offering.
Building an efficient customer segmentation to seize opportunitiesRefined value propositionA value proposition refers to what an organization says it can deliver to its customers. While Luke had fantastic researchers, the organization was missing a clear value proposition to present its services. As John puts it, TietoEVRY’s expertise helped Luke’s teams “to make more of the knowledge that we have”.“Really talented researchers were working in the sales group, but they were not getting enough information internally to further develop ideas so that we could make more of the knowledge that we have.”
—John Kettle, Director of Sales and International Relations, Luke.Today, Luke’s value proposition is clear and crisp.“We are independent scientific research and advisory organization with a wide network of stakeholders. We actively research global change drivers and have the skills and knowledge to assess sustainability and holistic ecosystems.”Improved customer segmentationBy implementing tools and processes to better segment their prospects and clients, TietoEVRY’s experts helped Luke’s teams to strengthen their sales process and prioritize key segments. As an example, having a clear and detailed customer segmentation helped John and his teams to visualize which companies in Finland could need their services, and how they could help them.Why did Luke decide to work with TietoEVRY?For starters, working with TietoEVRY came as a natural decision for John.“TietoEVRY has a great reputation, they were familiar with our industry and they are reading from the same book.”
—John Kettle, Director of Sales and International Relations, Luke.John also mentioned that TietoEVRY’s team took the time to “listen and understand what our needs were”. Doing so, our experts at TietoEVRY were able to interpret Luke’s needs and deliver a tailored proposal on time, following a thorough timeline.“Luke’s people carry a vast knowledge regarding sustainability matters and they keep pushing for a better tomorrow. This really is what our societies need these days. We are proud to have helped to give this knowledge more visibility for Luke’s customers.”
—Antti Seppälä, Business Design Lead, TietoEVRY.The journey towards a more sustainable world is paved with challengesFortunately, organizations like Luke are giving everything they have, each day, to spread knowledge and help consumers all around the globe to be better. Thanks to TietoEVRY experts’ experience and tailored support, Luonnonvarakeskus now relies on clearer and more efficient internal processes and ways to digest and understand the information.TietoEVRY has provided digital experience consultancy services for Luke related to customer engagement and sales development during past years.", Antti Seppälä ,Digitalization , 14.1.2021
"Time for a secure way to support merchants, consumers and IoT payments",/en/blog/2020/09/tokenization-the-secure-way-to-support-merchants-consumers-and-iot-payments/,Digitalization / Toms  Jansons / 8.1.2021,"Is it as simple as replacing cards with secure tokens?Based on our experience, we are convinced that replacing card data with tokens – which replace sensitive data – is the way forward. Why? Tokenization gives you the opportunity to create personalized rules such as limiting the number of times a token can be used or allocating a token to a specific wallet such as Apple or Google Pay. Essentially, you can implement a broad range of rules to meet the needs of your consumers.And, as you might expect, the same process can be applied to merchants in case they store card credentials on their side. Not surprisingly, beyond their customer reward programs, many merchants don’t want to store too much sensitive customer data. Therefore, a unique token can be generated and assigned for every merchant that is willing to perform card-on-file transactions – in this way, no card data is recorded by the merchant.Industry giants are embracing tokenizationMerchants like Amazon and service providers such as PayPal are already using tokenization technology. Since it can reduce the scope of PCI-DSS requirements and cost, card organizations are actively proposing their tokenization services on the processing side or payment gateway to help merchants tokenize payments. Scheme tokenization ensures that issuers are always aware to which merchant the token has been issued to and provide this information to the cardholder in their digital channels – internet bank or application. Thus, it creates awareness to cardholder about where he has registered his credentials.The other benefit with scheme tokenization is that if transaction data is compromised at any time, you don’t have to go through the costly process of blocking and issuing a new card, you simply close the token and issue a new one. It’s cost-effective and ensures personal data remains secure.Major benefits for merchantsOne reason we expect to see a big growth in the use of tokenization for merchants is that it promotes smooth subscription service payments and transactions in the form of card-on-file transactions. Nowadays, people simply want to log their card details with a provider like Netflix or Amazon, and not worry about payments. Through scheme tokenization, payment details are automatically refreshed should a customer lose or have a card stolen, as issuers are obliged to send updates through card networks. The end result is that transaction approval rates are higher, subscribing customers are happier, and turnover is secured for merchants.Next steps for tokenizationWe believe that tokenization will get even more traction in the future with the continued growth of the internet of things and always-connected devices, where we will start to see many new opportunities and advancements. The technology has already been embedded in connected cars, where tokens can be used for payment at toll stations and gas stations.The next logical step beyond these car-related drive through services, is that you will be able to pay from your home appliances, i.e. your TV or fridge as long as they are connected to the internet. This will add yet another channel for payments beyond an app or online. Obviously, this will make the management of such connected devices – both from the acquirer and issuer perspective – even more challenging.As a banks or financial institution, it’s better to prepare in advance for this, rather than having to play catch-up and fall behind competitors.Start building the  tokenization platformIn our experience,  banks that build an inhouse tokenization platform with multiple card schemes quickly get derailed, as each card scheme has its own rules and requirements and merchants generally want to provide all the consumer-preferred payment methods. However, we can help you navigate this by integrating multiple card schemes– we provide you with an all-encompassing tokenization solution.Related blogsA digital card experience for a more profitable futureCut the inconvenience.

How Nordic banking is turning investment greener and more sustainable in 2021,/en/blog/2021/01/green-asset-finance/,Sustainability / Jennifer  Rebel / 7.1.2021,"Airports all over the world are empty. Reduction in air pollution have made the Himalayan mountain tops visible from cities in India. In short, the covid-19 pandemic has helped us visualize how a sustainable and ecologically balanced world would look like. Question is, how do we make these examples a permanent reality? And what role do banks play in making it all happen?In addition to launching a new whitepaper looking more closely at the role the financial sector is playing, I’ve rounded up some inspiring signs of a growing trend I’ve seen in my own time as a tech and business enthusiast working with banks in our corner of the world.Read all about how banks are making green investments and new business models possible hereGreen bonds from SEBAs early as 2007 the Swedish bank SEB started its first green bonds project with The World Bank. The goal was to make sustainable investment accessible to the mainstream investors. And a lot has happened both in SEB and finance in general since then. Total Green Bond markets have just passed USD 1Trln since inception and there is an expectation of next year's issuance moving towards USD 500bn. SEB themselves see the growing demand for transparent green investment as a great opportunity going into 2021.In our whitepaper you’ll be able to find other great examples on how the investment community sees changing business models as a benefit for the climate and particularly green bonds as an important tool for turning that benefit into reality.Sustainable credit cardsEarlier this year, TietoEVRY and Länsförsäkringar Bank proudly launched the world’s first renewable payment cards. The cards are made of recycled plastic and save up to 75% of the emissions they otherwise would have created. This is a notable contribution both in the practical sense and in how it shows us where the mindset of the financial sector is moving in terms of recycling and resource optimization.We already know that recycling is a big topic in the European Union and by 2021 new regulations will be put in place to ensure a longer lifetime of appliances like TVs, freezers, washing machines and fridges. Although there isn’t a push towards recycled payment cards (yet), there is no reason why banks should rest. Actually, being proactive and making changes before regulators put them into law shows a great attitude and will to do something about emissions. And in that way Länsförsäkringar is leading the change.The sharing economy and how it’s financedWith the digital economy, new business models emerge with a stronger focus on resource optimalization. Banks and financial institutions play a key role in bringing these to fruition. I myself have been in meetings with banks in Sweden who are eager to explore the new possibilities the shared economy has for our climate. And it’s not just empty words. Earlier this year SEB and Husqvarna launched a joint project looking into how finance and industry intertwine when faced by the sharing economy. In the whitepaper you will find plenty of examples of how specific banks approach new ways of entering partnerships and co-creating funding models that benefit the environment.Green offices and workplacesIf there is one thing that the pandemic has taught us is that very much of the traveling we used to do for meetings is absolutely redundant. Working in a multinational company like TietoEVRY, or a bank with presence in several countries we were used to travel by plane for the luxury of face-to-face meetings. However, with our attitudes to digital meetings being changed by lockdowns and travel restrictions, it’s safe to assume this won’t be the norm going into 2021. Neither for the climate, nor for the efficiency and cost savings in our organizations.Although meeting face to face is important, I believe the balance will shift. Companies are also adopting new trust-based policies when it comes to working from home, like the Norwegian mobile operator Telenor announcing a “work from anywhere as the standard approach” earlier this year. This will probably make the need for office space shrink, but the climate reward is without a doubt present.Considering 1.5 million people work in the banking sector in the US alone, reducing weekly travel to an office and the energy consumption of the office space implies great cuts to greenhouse gases. My experience from working with banks in Sweden is that they not only wish to turn investments towards sustainability. They’re also turning their own workspaces and “ways of working” in the very same direction!2021 – The year of green opportunities?The year 2020 has thrown the world economy into a crisis, but out of that crisis there’s opportunity for great change. If anything, we know that the world economy and the world ecology are closely linked.Together, the great changes present a multi-trillion-dollar global opportunity for the financial industry if the right tools are developed and offered to customers. In other words, technology is finally making green investments profitable as well as possible. There’s a growing wish to mold a new kind of economy and the start of 2021 would be the perfect time to act!Download the ""Green Asset Finance"" whitepaper here and continue on your sustainable journey", Jennifer  Rebel ,Sustainability , 7.1.2021
"Time to reach cloud benefits faster, without disrupting your business",/en/blog/2021/01/relocate-your-applications-to-the-cloud/,Cloud / Francisco Romero Gotor  / 5.1.2021,"Full cloud transformations require a very structured methodology and processes for transforming an organization’s application landscape, typically by refactoring and/or rearchitecting applications to be migrated. These approaches put the cloud months or even years away, delaying cloud benefits and making them hard to reach for small and medium-sized businesses.Reach cloud benefits faster, without disrupting your businessThere is a well-known standardized model for migrating the applications to the cloud that is known as the 6 Rs:​ Replatform, Refactor, Replace, Rehost, Retain and Retire.In addition to those, there is luckily the seventh “R” Relocate that strikes a balance, reaching meaningful cloud benefits at a reasonable speed without creating disruptions to business. This method tremendously speeds up cloud journeys. It decouples business transformation from technology transformation, thus allowing organizations to get cloud benefits from new technologies, without forcing businesses to change at the same time. Check out the video below where Onni Rautanen explains this in more detail.When relocating, apps and workloads are moved from data centers to the cloud as they are, without redesigning the apps – meaning migration can be done with almost no business disruption. Once applications are in a cloud-like environment, businesses immediately see some of the key cloud benefits: fast provisioning, API-driven automation, security by design, and improved business continuity, along with the obvious benefit of shortened lead-time to cloud.Avoid interference to business when relocating to the cloudAn important factor in avoiding business disruptions when performing cloud migrations is to maintain the as-is situation in terms of security requirements and data sovereignty. Hybrid Cloud, as a destination, allows you to keep your on-prem workloads on-prem, thus avoiding any issues from a data security point of view.COVID-19 has shown organizations that they need to be able to respond fast when they change their IT solutions to adapt to new business needs. In this context, relocating becomes a good option whenever scalability and accessibility from distributed locations need to be un-leashed quickly to users.So, what’s the story with ""Relocate""?A new generation of tools from VMware literally expands your current environments into the Hybrid cloud and allows you to perform large-scale migrations of virtual machines (VM) with close to zero downtime for your application in the best of cases. This can dramatically increase the speed of migrations to the cloud.Hybrid Cloud environments, where the private and public environments are on feature parity levels, are also a necessary enabler for low-risk and speedy cloud transformations. Specifically, they allow you to keep your on-prem setup on-prem, but with the above-mentioned cloud benefits.Having a new toolset is, however, not enough. Before virtual machines can be moved to the cloud, application dependencies between other VMs, applications, and services must be understood. A single virtual machine might be communicating with many other virtual machines and services. Thus, there could be a variety of consequences if we migrate only a portion of the application stack. Furthermore, egress traffic could incur additional costs that weren’t accounted for, and many other impacts connected with application dependencies need to be carefully planned to avoid business disruption. This is why you need a partner with proven experience in application migration execution to conduct a successful relocation without business disruption.Today, new technologies and strong partnerships with service providers can simplify the adoption of cloud solutions and enable swift migrations. This makes the Relocate method a no-brainer for organizations seeking to reap cloud benefits straightaway.A cloud shortcut, but not short on cloud benefitsFull cloud transformations are still essential for some organizations, but a quick relocation can deliver cloud benefits much faster than before. Once workloads are relocated to the cloud, organizations can then move forward with full cloud-based application transformations at their own pace. Application refactoring and rearchitecting can happen after critical cloud benefits are unlocked, while organizations already benefit from using a single cloud operating model across all platforms and locations.The partnership between TietoEVRY and VMware makes the ""Relocate"" track widely available by offering a ready-to-use Hybrid Cloud IaaS platform as your Cloud destination, coupled with simple and non-disruptive migration tools and processes.

Time for a more profitable future. Time for a digital card experience.,/en/blog/2020/10/a-digital-card-experience-for-a-more-profitable-future/,Digitalization / Toms  Jansons / 1.1.2021,"Customer experience  – delivering an equal or better user experience than fintechsAs a bank, you are responsible for ensuring services are delivered securely while providing a good customer experience that rivals new agile competitors in the form of neo-banks and fintechs. In our experience, this means you are left with little choice – either you partner, merge or acquire a competitor or you transform your operations. If not, your customer journey roadmap will get held back by legacy systems and operating processes that can’t manage the necessary “escalating” change.Automating card services and offering customers instant availability options and thus increase profitability, through new services and features.For instance, virtual cards can be instantly issued and made available for purchases in e-commerce or uploaded to different wallets for immediate use in brick and mortar stores, before the physical card even arrives. Customers can set their own PIN code, create reminders, should they forget the PIN, and even create rules and restrictions for use, i.e. daily limits and geographical restrictions – something that we have found is becoming more and more popular among users.New revenue stream segmentsIn recent years we’ve all seen how the margins within the consumer business are shrinking, especially now that there is a cap on interchange rates in Europe. Therefore, there is a greater need to explore new business segments that offer higher margins.Providing new services to corporate clients is the perfect example of this. Not only can a corporate client benefit from all the above mentioned services, but through automation, you could also provide them with the insights and solutions necessary to help them control corporate expenses, drive savings and grow their businesses. We believe new services such as these, will be instrumental for banks and financial institutions to secure long-term relationships with key corporate clients. And just as importantly, it will enable you to grow your customer base – by entering new customer segments and gain access to new revenue streams.Go beyond a typical commercial card solution and deliver something that will enable you to stand out in what is becoming a crowded marketplace! This could include such things as offering unlimited, multi-hierarchy account and transaction authorization processes that resemble corporate client’s structures and internal policies, offering different limits and restrictions on each hierarchy level. An advanced commercial card solution will also provide much more flexibility when it comes to reporting and billing options based on a client’s requirements moving forward.Internal processes – the key to delivering optimal customer experiencesAs great as all these technical opportunities sound, in our experience we know that an internal shift is also required. Modern architecture and new, dynamic systems will have to be reflected in internal processes– which will require change. In many cases customers are looking for a new modern platform to embrace their digital journey however don’t put enough focus on their business and operational processes which should be reviewed and challenged as well. For example – a typical card issuing process often takes over a week as usually there are internal application approval processes even for low risk segment and a card is delivered in the post, before a customer can use it for the first time. Digital experience required by the customers change this, and your internal processes must be able to cope with the changes.At the end of the day, it’s going to come down to a question of how to act, not if to act. You can start today by reviewing your customer experience and fine-tuning your internal processes. The quicker you start, the quicker you can secure your customer base and explore new opportunities.Related blogs:Tokenization: the secure way to support merchants, consumers and IoT paymentsCut the inconvenience.

Five easy ways to enhance security for your online consumers,/en/blog/2020/12/five-easy-ways-to-enhance-security-for-youronlineconsumers/,Cybersecurity insights / Oskar Ehrnström / 22.12.2020,"For many, picking up groceries or gifts online will be nothing new. They are digitally savvy and enjoy the flexibility and convenience it provides. Yet for some consumers, it has been a whole new experience, and potentially a daunting one too. And it’s this group that’s often in the crosshairs of hackers who know how to exploit the situation to their own advantage.Let them know they are safeAs cyberattacks increase, the onus is businesses to demonstrate to their consumers and potential hackers that they take security – and the protection of personal data – very seriously. The aim: keep criminals away and turn new customers into loyal friends.We’re happy to help you with an assessment of your business’ security needs and are also able to support you in everything from planning and implementation to running your security services.5 easy actions to boost securityBut there are also some easy actions you can take already now to show your customers (and criminals) that you’re serious about protecting their information online:Provide payment methods that don’t require your customers to enter their credit card credentials, such as invoice services and payment solutions through apps.
Let your partners shine on your offering page as a token of quality. Support each other like a chain of brands that vouch for each other.
Be consistent in your communication with your customers. This way they get to know your tone of voice, which could make it easier for them to spot an attempt by a malicious actor trying to act like you in order to access their personal data.
Use your own channels for customer communication, like social media or your own app. A lot of attackers use emails and SMS to exploit customers’ trust in your brand, so avoid those if you have other alternatives. 
Be as structured in your approach to digital security as you are in security for your bricks and mortar stores and offices. The reality is that many retailers struggle to achieve the same level of security for their digital assets as they do for their physical spaces. So make sure you have enough ‘guards’ within your digital spaces as well.We all know that positive experiences are crucial to making customers happy and forming a relationship based on loyalty.For online retailers or service providers, a key part of providing those positive experiences is showing your customers not only that you are capable of protecting their personal data – but also how.", Oskar Ehrnström ,Cybersecurity insights , 22.12.2020
Towards a more equal digital society,/en/blog/2020/12/towards-a-more-equal-digital-society/,Digitalization / Kimmo Alkio / 18.12.2020,"In fact, this exceptional year has accelerated the digitalization of society in many ways. At our Capital Markets Day in early December, we estimated that the pandemic may have accelerated digital development by as much as three years.Amid all the uncertainty, organizations did not stop in their tracks. Instead, they doubled down on digital solutions to not only push through the crisis, but to emerge stronger as the pandemic passes. This development is significant for the competitiveness of Nordic businesses, for sustainable development and even for the national economy.But with opportunities come threats: 2020 also increased some of the risks that may jeopardize a sustainable and equal digitalization process. Going digital only fully benefits economies and society as a whole if the digital tools and services we use are trusted, equal access to them is guaranteed and the benefits of digitalization are universally understood.So much depends on trust – people will use digital services only if they trust them.Our Security Barometer suggests that public trust in digitalization in the Nordics requires more work, although there are small signs of increasing trust.One challenge is that public trust in digital services is weakened by, for instance, threats to information security, which reduces their use and therefore their development. However, the stable society and world-renowned information security expertise in the Nordics provide a good basis for further development.Digital inequality is another challenge we face today. The pandemic has pushed people to work remotely and made digital solutions for productive work a critical success factor for many organizations. Basic services are increasingly moving into the digital platforms, yet our increasingly multicultural and aging society means that we must remember to safeguard social equality.When digital development accelerates so rapidly, we run the risk of overlooking special needs. It is more important than ever that service providers and developers make certain that services are widely available and easy to use so that no-one is left outside our digital society.Still, the enormous possibilities presented by digitalization outweigh the threats. Digitalization plays an ever-greater role in meeting the most important challenges of mankind, in generating innovation and in supporting us in everyday life. Technology allows us to provide different sectors with digital solutions that significantly reduce emissions.New technologies such as blockchain, IoT, AI and cloud services make the efficient use of real-time data possible and provide a way to reduce our consumption of energy and resources as well as optimize our logistics networks.We cannot afford to turn our back on progress. Open cooperation will increase trust in digital services and support widespread public access to the benefits of digitalization. We must make certain that, even when the pace of progress is fast, no-one is left behind.", Kimmo Alkio ,Digitalization , 18.12.2020
Microsoft Azure trainings benefit both our professionals and customers,/en/blog/2020/12/microsoft-azure-trainings-benefit-both-our-professionals-and-customers/,Cloud / Christian Pedersen / 18.12.2020,"The World Economic Forum states that active learning is one of the top 10 job skills of tomorrow. The Azure training program is an important factor in our learning strategy to better discuss and execute cloud transformation with our customers.The fresh IDC Nordic Cloud Survey 2020 has revealed that multi-cloud solutions have become the standard digital backbone of Nordic businesses. Most Nordic companies are now using multi-cloud solutions as an organizational strategy or architectural approach for their digital transformation programs.Our experience over years of customer engagement shows that cloud solutions allow organizations to increase their business agility with up to 70% faster time to market, to reduce total cost of operations by up to 40% over time, and to reach superior levels of operational resiliency and security.But at the same time, the survey showed that a lack of resources and expertise are among the top three challenges hampering cloud adoption. Indeed, around one third of companies named these as challenges in executing cloud transformation. This is a serious issue, as one of the major benefits of cloud transformation for organizations comes not specifically from the technology but from the broader cloud operation model, which combines technology, processes and competencies.At TietoEVRY, we have invested strategic effort into developing our cloud capabilities for a long time. This work was very recently recognized by the ISG Provider Lens™ Public Cloud study that positioned TietoEVRY as a Nordic Leader. We were quite gratified to be acknowledged as an “instrumental technology and next-generation IT service provider with its robust cloud portfolio and niche talent availability in the Nordics”.The study also notes that “TietoEVRY’s public cloud managed services, with demonstrated transformation capabilities, help clients to accelerate digital transformation journey”.Let’s take a look at how we at TietoEVRY continuously undertake digital upskilling to support our customers’ cloud transformation.Building the largest Azure professional network in the NordicsIn early 2020, we launched a development program together with our strategic partner Microsoft to certify 3 000 Microsoft Azure professionals at TietoEVRY. Our ambition is to create the largest Azure community in the Nordics. And the training has already had substantial benefits.Our customers of course demand that we have the competencies to solve the challenges they face. To understand customers and ultimately fulfil their needs, the right components, skills and expertise must be brought into the dialogue with the customer.With almost 3 000 experts trained in all-things Azure, we have the latest knowledge at the disposal of our customers. This also means having experts with very deep and vast competence area expertise in solving our customers’ very complex challenges. But this training is also relevant to our commitment to being an attractive employer.People want to work where they can learn and be challenged and supported in their continuous journey of professional development. And this is confirmed by the very positive feedback we have received from our colleagues all across the Nordics.Continuous learning is a cornerstone of our cultureThe Azure training is one concrete example of how we help our employees to build on their skills, develop new ones and also drive more and more relevant discussions with our customers. For example, one of our Nordic colleagues noted that the training has enhanced her competence, which has in turn empowered her to take on a leading role in transforming our customers’ operations for the cloud.MS Azure trainings are meant for all, from sales to technical experts and leadership to project managers. Upskilling helps to understand the bigger picture, not just one project or delivery at a time, and it also creates a wider benefit for our customers and us as a company.At TietoEVRY, learning never stops. MS Azure trainings and associated certifications are highly valuable to our current people as well as future talents. See how we together with our strategic partner Microsoft drive digital transformation by increasing cloud competencies and helping organizations to develop their operations and business with cloud solutions.At TietoEVRY, learning never stops. Check our open positions, and join us!", Christian Pedersen ,Cloud , 18.12.2020
Keep it simple – enhance customer experience and engagement with SAP CX,/en/blog/2020/12/keep-it-simple--enhance-customer-experience-and-engagement-with-sap-cx/,Digitalization / Jouko Juuti / 17.12.2020,"Far too often, I find companies placing customer experience functions in front-end applications without alignment to business processes. This leads to difficulties in fulfilling real service expectations and managing costs and profits transparently.Old agricultural wisdom states that “Effectual milk production is not based on an efficient milking machine, but on a well-fed and happy cow.” This wisdom can be applied to Enterprise Architecture as well. Your best bet is often to go back to basics, simplify processes, and not get blinded by technologies.Being relevant for your customers and simplifying processes requires a common Enterprise Architecture defined together by business and IT. Start from the business and the necessary processes, describe the data that is needed – and then decide which technologies and applications are used.Simplicity is the shortest path to great customer experienceSimplification helps to promote common understanding and efficiency. Here are two examples of what simplification can mean in practice to business and the IT that supports it.Example 1: Simplifying the Lead-Opportunity-Quote-Order-Fulfillment-Payment processAs its long-winded name suggests, the Lead-Opportunity-Quote-Order-Fulfillment-Payment is a complex process with numerous sub-processes and stakeholders. When one of my customers experienced long lead times and the delivered products did not meet the original requests, we were invited to study their lead-to-order process, and come up with recommendations on how to simplify it.One key finding was the incompatibility of the different technologies and data models, which resulted in difficult integration needs, and the operation of each application in a ""silo"", meaning that the user did not have visibility or control over end-to-end outcomes.Our recommendation was to decrease the number of technologies used in the process. It did the trick.Example 2: Developing the customer’s service businessAnother customer was suffering from long lead times and challenges in meeting needs with the defined service packages.We found out that after customer needs were recorded in the CRM system, they were delivered in Excel format to a person who configured it in SAP ERP. The manual work prolonged the lead times and increased errors. The key challenge seemed to be that when the configured packet was sent back to the CRM system, the difference in data models made it impossible to keep the message consistent.There are no easy answers when solutions have already been built based on different technologies. It is therefore essential to identify the risk areas of the solution and create operating models for their management. To avoid these problems in the future, we suggested that our customer create Enterprise Architecture.Lead-to-cash capability makes SAP CX a real treasureAfter years of working with business IT, I am still thrilled to find innovations that help to improve performance while keeping things simple. Here is one of my recent findings around customer experience and engagement: SAP CX. In my opinion, it’s a hidden gem.Already in the 2000s, it was recognized that 70% of CRM projects have integration to ERP. Yet most of today’s CRM’s are poorly integrated to ERP backbone. To get full value for businesses, ERP and customer engagement layers need to be tightly integrated. SAP is doing extremely well in this regard.If SAP ERP is your company’s backbone – or SAP S/4HANA forms your technology platform – you should know this about SAP CX:SAP’s CX portfolio presents best in class solutions without SAP’s heritage and culture. This improves customer processes with focused scope enabling innovations.
 The open environment has created a readiness to integrate to SAP or non-SAP solutions in the customer’s solution landscape. In practice, this means independency to implement any CX application and improve customer engagement experience step by step. 
 SAP’s large customer base and its new agile and innovative applications are a huge advantage to customers wishing to combine stability with agility.
 SAP is continuing investments in its new CX offerings to enable integration to SAP ERPs and other ecosystem applications. This is good news for all companies that have SAP ERP as a backbone solution and wish to develop their customer engagement.In sum, SAP CX is a great way to increase customer experience and engagement – while keeping things simple. We at TietoEVRY are happy to help you make the most of SAP CX.We at TietoEVRY have strong expertise both with customer-centric solutions like SAP CX and backbone ERPs.

"Cloud computing powers the data economy – of course, but how?",/en/blog/2020/12/cloud-computing-powers-the-data-economy/,Cloud / Alberto Valero / 15.12.2020,"The value of data is unlocked when organizations are able to collect and “refine” mountains of it. Refined data is the fuel for running Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to make more and more accurate predictions and ultimately better decisions.The formula to obtain the holy grail of Artificial Intelligence and big data analytics is quite simple:Data Value = mountains of (curated) data + ML algorithms.In other words, data is valuable if it enables business or societal applications of accurate predictions based on huge data sets and appropriate algorithms.But this iterative equation demands serious quantities of fuel to run continuously – and that means vast amounts of ubiquitous computing power and data storage. My colleague Johan Torstensson also discussed this in his recent blog, where he notes multi-cloud systems are the new norm, and organizations need to be aware of the silos.Don’t fight data gravityWe have seen many enterprises make over-simplistic conclusions like this one. “If we want to run any AI on IoT use case, we simply use cloud solutions. Here, we have an IoT business implementation for the predictive maintenance of our oil rigs with intelligent valves in the pipes – let’s just run everything on AWS.”In at-scale implementations of this kind of IoT initiative, early adopters have learnt that this is a very expensive and often ineffective solution. There are many factors that limit central cloud solutions alone from always working optimally for IoT applications, but three issues stand out:Network latency and data gravity – Data gravity is based on the idea that large data sets have mass, like the planets, and the higher the gravity, the more applications will be attracted to where the data is created and used. Applications requests often can only tolerate very low network latency. This can be life critical in certain health IoT scenarios or self-driving vehicles.
Cloud and connectivity costs – IT economics indicates that data transfer costs and the high cost of central cloud resources constrain implementations. There is a clear need to find the optimal placement of compute and data storage resources to avoid prohibitive cloud costs and increase real time IoT performance.
Data sovereignty – Global IoT services will face different local regulations that will demand that the data is located within local boundaries.Public cloud alone is not an optimal engine for the data economyCloud services truly power the data economy, but this goes beyond what we know as the public cloud. Cloud resources are genuinely ubiquitous, spanning hybrid and multi-cloud environments and distributed along all points from core cloud data centers to Edge IoT devices and even sensors. Solutions beyond the public cloud present remarkable opportunities for increased efficiency.If you consider network latency and data gravity, data sovereignty and economic factors together – along with the fact that many end-point devices run on batteries and that data transfer is very energy hungry – you will understand why Edge computing is positioned to blossom. Edge computing is based on the need to find the right balance between the placement of data, computing power to run decision-making algorithms, network design and pervasive security. This complex of models needs to be optimized with ML-aided IoT orchestration platforms.Core to Edge hybrid and multi-cloud continuum solutions power “liquid IT”Digital pervasiveness is enabled by digital technology setups that I call “liquid IT”:liquid computing – anywhere and optimized computing based on virtualization of network and data center resources,
liquid data – data-flows and optimized data placement based on type and use of datasets,
liquid applications – API-integrated microservices running on containers.The fluidity of users, applications and data powered by APIs, policy-driven governance, automation, etc., needs to be accelerated to truly serve our customers’ business success through digital solutions.We need to do that with robust end-to-end orchestration. Once we have understood this, we can solve the governance and management of “liquid IT”. This requires some strategy, as shown by the example of a solid ice ball. At first, it is relatively easy to hold in your hand, but when it melts and becomes water, it is impossible to hold, no matter how strong your grip is. This is the problem with “liquid IT” – it is way too complex. You need a “container” for your “liquid IT” to prevent it from spilling .This “liquid container” is composed of the software-defined platforms that create the “guard-rails” to govern and orchestrate your IT. This can be as simple as a multi-cloud platform deployed and operated as code by the cloud platform/SRE team in a pure-play cloud environment. Alternatively, this can be a unified management platform for integrated management of both your “solid” and “liquid” IT – or should we say… “melting IT” to describe it being in a transition to the cloud.This management platform is powered by AI/ML and automation (AIOps), enabling end-to-end operation and governance of that “liquid IT”. Traditional ways of managing IT are not designed for digitally intensive IT. Instead, they are designed to manage traditional “solid IT”.There is no time to lose to deploy the digital fabric of hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure, that will unlock the value of fluid data and accelerate digital development process in your business without creating multi-silos.

Coronabot — a winner in the Covid-19 pandemic,/en/blog/2020/12/coronabot-a-winner-in-covid-19-pandemic/,Data / Matti Airas / 10.12.2020,"A coronabot is a conversational chatbot linked to a time-booking system. All coronabots have one thing in common: a function called a symptom checker. A symptom checker is a set of questions whose answers recommend a course of action. Some coronabots are also linked to a lab-testing system and send a text message to citizens who have negative test results. All of this happens automatically, while the testing and lab work still need to be done manually by healthcare professionals.In healthcare systems without coronabots, a healthcare professional takes the Covid-19 call, books the time for the test, and reports the negative results manually. This takes ten to fifteen minutes of work per case. A coronabot cuts that time to zero. For 10,000 monthly Covid-19 calls, the saving is equal to the workload of about ten full-time professionals.But the savings materialize only if citizens know about and use the service. Luckily they are doing so and in high numbers. Coronabots are about as close as you get in the software industry to a perfect match between need and solution.Using a coronabot’s symptom checker requires fewer digital skills than writing a text message or attaching a photo to Facebook. There is no waiting in line, it is available 24/7, and it costs close to nothing to run. A coronabot is also more private than a phone call, and you can use it almost anywhere.Coronabots are the first mass-use symptom checker applications that are integrated to care processes and systems. They will pave the way for a wider range of integrated symptom checkers and change the way primary healthcare is provided for high-volume ailments with mild symptoms.", Matti Airas ,Data , 10.12.2020
Leading a team of seven to victory in one of Scandinavia’s biggest Hackathons after less than two years in the job!,/en/blog/2020/12/leading-a-team-of-seven-to-victory-in-one-of-scandinavias-biggest-hackathons-after-less-than-two-years-in-the-job/,Meet our people / Amir  Zarei / 10.12.2020,"“I wanted to work as a project manager”“It’s obviously scary leading a team where you know there will be so many different people from many countries. At the beginning I was really unsure and scared that we wouldn't function well at all. However, I quickly noticed that everyone was taking this seriously and really wanted to put in hard work in order to succeed,” he says.Are you also dreaming of leading a team to success? Then you can have that dream fulfilled sooner than you think. We're looking for new graduates.Every day brings new jobs, challenges and successesAmir started with us in 2017 as a project manager in Business Consulting.“I wanted to work as a project manager. TietoEVRY supported me and I most likely learned more in six months than in three years sat at my school desk.”In addition to a great social environment and good colleagues, Amir feels it is particularly exciting to have a job with many cool clients and projects. One such  project involved working with Bertil the robot.Amir started with us because he was unsure about which field he wanted to focus on, and so requested the chance to have a trial period within different verticals. Over the last two years, he has therefore had a number of different balls to juggle, and no two days are the same.‘There’s no such thing as a typical workday for me! Each day is different to the next. I also do tasks that don’t necessarily fall under the position of project manager. I have a degree in engineering, so I sometimes help out in the architecture department if they need some assistance.At work you’ll most often find Amir in a suit and nice shoes, but in his spare time he raps, lives on Løkka and follows the latest fashion trends.Asked to recall something he is particularly proud of, Amir answers without hesitation: leading the team that won the SAS Hackathon is at the very top of his list.“Right at the very beginning I was worried we wouldn’t all manage together, but it wasn't long before I was really happy every time we met up. Besides being involved in developing a pilot product that I thought was incredibly useful and cool, I've also gained several new friends. Colleagues from entirely different departments that I’d never likely have got to know without this project.”Hand-picked teamIt was Kåre Nygård at TietoEVRY Consulting who put together the team that took part in the competition. In order to obtain the right balance in the group, great emphasis was placed on diversity.“Some have worked here for many years, and others are recent graduates who came to us directly after their studies. It was essential that we had different backgrounds, positions and experiences, because that’s what makes us complement each other. No one can be the best at everything,” says Amir.Many hands make light workSupporting the seven who participated in the competition was a sizeable support team, each of whom was involved in developing the project. In addition to these people, Amir and the team had the municipality of Stavanger behind them.“It was much easier working on the project when we actually had a physical ‘client’ to talk with about the challenges the project would cover. This is something that SAS also put great emphasis on and was one of the key reasons we won. Aside from that, it's because we clearly are the dream team,” says Amir, smiling proudly.The competition provided Amir with plenty of opportunities, which ended with him leading the Finance Assistant project in FSS, which is a complex AI product for the banking and finance of the future.Working with a competent and experienced team based in Oslo, Trondheim and Poland, Amir got to create FSS from scratch and participate in all aspects of product development from analysis, estimation, design and architecture, to project planning, development and the sale of the product to some of Norway's largest banks.The team after taking the top prize at the SAS HackathonFinding the dream jobAfter three years, Amir has gained new knowledge, a huge number of new experiences and good colleagues, as well as taken on exciting challenges.“The best thing about working here is, of course, the great people in the company who create a good environment. Plus, I have a really varied working day and the opportunity to choose which exciting projects I get involved in. Over the time I've worked here, I've learned so much, both in practice and also through courses and certifications that we take part in. Hand on heart, I can say that I’ve landed my dream job.”If you haven’t yet clicked the application ad, Amir hopes to persuade you.“I think most people who are looking for work aren’t that sure what it is they're actually looking for. You can easily get stuck in a rut by wondering whether the positions are the right ones, particularly when you factor in daily job tasks, your own interests and the relevance in relation to your education. What you should know about working here is that you get the opportunity to try out a lot of different things. Most likely you’ll also find out things you didn’t know about yourself. Internally, there will be an opportunity to move both positions and departments in order to find a role that you really enjoy. Plus, I have to just say, I always love having new cool colleagues, and I promise to give you a warm welcome when you start here.”The recruitment for the graduate program in Norway, Sweden and Finland has started - Apply Now!", Amir  Zarei ,Meet our people , 10.12.2020
My graduate experience with a mentor for support and inclusion,/en/blog/2020/12/my-graduate-experience-with-a-mentor-for-support-and-inclusion/,Meet our people / Vegard  Valvik / 7.12.2020,"Vegard is a consultant in application innovation. He usually works with upgrading and maintenance of monitoring of uptime and customer support in parts of Equinor's application portfolio.“My work tasks vary a lot, but something I always need is to keep myself updated on current issues. That can be users that need help, or a new version of an application I have the responsibility for.”Mentor programWhen Vegard had finished his bachelor’s degree in information technology, he searched for positions at TietoEVRY. Two interesting roles popped up: one for the position of a developer and another for the position he holds today.Some months before he was finished writing his bachelor’s degree, he participated in a careers day at TietoEVRY. This gave him a good impression of the company, and therefore led him to apply for both positions. Initially, Vegard favored most the developer role, but the leader of the department managed to convince him about the fit and merits of the consultant role, which Vegard ended up accepting. He hasn’t looked back.“After the career day I got the impression that TietoEVRY had a good social environment and many competent and knowledgeable employees, something I find important,” says Vegard. “I also learned that there are great opportunities to move internally to other departments with other tasks. Even though I ended up in a different position than I had initially wanted, I have not regretted for a second that it was this job I accepted. Varied work tasks and a pleasant environment and colleagues help to ensure that.”When Vegard started working with us for around two year ago, he especially appreciated that he was assigned a mentor who he could learn a little extra from.“Kjell was available to me every time I had a question and showed great interest in me learning and understanding the work. I'm incredibly glad I had someone who helped me figure out what qualities I have that add knowledge to the company. Especially in times like these, when most new employees start at home offices, I think it is a particularly great advantage to have a person you can turn to.”Kjell is an experienced professional but it was his first time being a mentor when Vegard joined the company.“To be a mentor was exciting and rewarding. Even though I have worked here for many years, I have never had similar tasks. I think it went beyond all expectations. I learned a lot from it and think it was an honor to be a mentor. Therefore I would of course agree to be a mentor several times if the opportunity arises,” Kjell says.The Graduates program shaped great opportunities and big networkFrom day one, Vegard felt welcomed. Through the Graduate and the mentor program, he quickly formed a good network and got to know other colleagues from other departments and offices. Within a few months after he started, he also had the opportunity to take part in a large project that he still remembers well.“In this project I joined Kjell and another department for a handover on a big integration system for Equinor. It is a very complex system that a lot of people in Equinor depend on. This project has been a learning curve for me because I had to familiarize myself with the professional part of the application as well as learn the operating part of it.”Possibilities that make it easy to create a good social and working environmentOne of the most important reasons why Vegard likes it here is the environment and unity. Vegard thinks it is important that there is a focus on the social environment at work.“I think TietoEVRY is great when it comes to a social environment at work. There are many groups here that meet for a joint activity – nowadays it is mostly digital, but we hope to meet again soon. The fact that TietoEVRY provides an opportunity for such initiatives to take place makes it easy to get to know colleagues in other departments and helps to create a very good environment in the workplace.”After two year in the company Vegard is still as happy as he was when he first started and has no plans on leaving the company any time soon.“Even for me who has a position with such specific areas of responsibility, there are good opportunities to develop and learn a lot of new things. There are always new and exciting things ahead. I feel very lucky that I get the opportunity to work with so many talented people. Therefore, I am very much looking forward to continuing this adventure.”The recruitment for the graduate program in Norway, Sweden and Finland has started - Apply now!", Vegard  Valvik ,Meet our people , 7.12.2020
Time for solid data governance,/en/blog/2019/12/what-is-data-governance-and-what-if-it-did-not-exist/,Data / Ritva Aula  / 5.12.2020,"Content updated in May 2021.Let’s get started with a simple real-life example – our phones. Imagine you are trying to contact your customer. You search your contact list, but the information is incorrect or missing. As a result, you try to reach the wrong person or are unable to make contact at all. And thus, additional effort is needed.Now let’s expand this scenario to your company – and multiply it by hundreds or even thousands of times when people try to use data and find information from tens or hundreds of different tools. If the data they find is inaccurate or missing, it can lead to incorrect actions and decisions – or a failure to act at all, not to mention wasted effort. Surprisingly enough, this is not just a thought experiment – it is the actual reality in many companies…In a nutshell, data governance aims to ensure that this scenario does not occur in companies and that data is seen and systematically managed as a strategic asset. It requires management attention, like any other critical function in the company. Simply put, data governance is needed for the company to collect quality data and make better decisions based on it – and to do this in a cost-efficient manner.Data basics need to be understood to drive successLet’s clear up a few basics – as to how data is seen and understood affects how it is approached. The first common issue in companies is that data content and data-related tools often get mixed up.Hyped terms such as data science, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are great means for companies to succeed in their business. But they are not silver bullets that alone make any company data-driven. Instead, they are tools and methodologies that utilize data content provided by other tools for e.g. discovering new insights and business opportunities and optimizing business processes. Without sufficient quality data, these tools can’t work to their fullest.This means ensuring data quality is a must. Data as a source of information presents what is happening or has happened historically, which illuminates the current situation and enables predictions. If data is incorrect, it tells “fake news”. Data governance done right aims to ensure that appropriate and quality data is identified, gathered and made available at different levels within organizations.Understanding the nature of data helps to solve data quality issues – consider data as water, flowing through pipes of a water plant, and processed by dedicated tools that ensure the water meets quality standards, is stored correctly, and can be safely used. Just like water in this example, data often comes from somewhere other than where it is consumed. Therefore, companies should proactively ensure transparency of where their data is created and what happens to it on its way to data consumers.The second common misunderstanding is that IT or IT strategy alone will ensure good quality data. This is not the case. As in the water plant example, differentiated roles are needed. Data roles and responsibilities should be clear and communicated across the company. Acknowledging that the business has a key role in defining their data requirements and verifying that data content, makes it easier to set up needed capabilities – both in the business generally and IT specifically. The third common issue is a lack of data management strategy. Data governance and management also need to be a strategic, enterprise-level initiative to get it up and running as a business-as-usual function. A data management strategy should ensure silos and different data governances do not occur within business units and functions – and should be linked to the overall business strategy, with clearly defined ownership and roles. Lastly, top management support is vital. Without it, any long-lasting and company-wide data governance efforts will probably fail.Data governance lays the foundation for the futureData governance is becoming even more critical: the amounts of data are increasing, and regulations such as the GDPR are bringing new restrictions and policies, underlining the importance of an enterprise-level strategic approach. Additionally, when data-driven initiatives and digitalization activities become more common, companies face unfamiliar challenges. If solid data governance is not in place, many organizations will face algorithms that do not work, leading to increasing resources dedicated to data validation and failed projects.Newly formed data science teams won’t be able to fulfil their promise if they spend most of their time finding, understanding and validating data. All this will also decrease productivity, increase costs, hamper agility and create employee dissatisfaction. Also, building company-wide competencies and key differentiators, such as customer experience, and business transformation – all of which are data-driven initiatives – will prove difficult without data governance.There is a clear connection between data governance success and business success. And when a company sets out to define its data governance, it is actually building one of its core competencies.So, how is your data quality? What is your data governance approach? Have you considered a data management maturity assessment to show you where to start? If you haven’t already asked yourself these questions, now is the time.", Ritva Aula  ,Data , 5.12.2020
"How to adopt cloud services, securely",/en/blog/2020/12/how-to-adopt-cloud-services-securely/,Cloud / Marius Sandbu / 5.12.2020,"In “IDC Nordic Cloud Survey 2020” we learned that many organizations are facing challenges related to compliance, security and a lack of expertise in executing cloud transformations. These struggles are why a partner like TietoEVRY can be vital.Making the most of the developing public cloudLeading providers Google, Amazon and Microsoft have published close to 2 000 changes or new features on a yearly basis, and that number will only climb further in the upcoming years.On one hand, these changes can present risks, but on the other hand, they mean more efficient, secure and cost-optimized services. Many of these updates are improvements in core features, performance and security that sometimes even offer cost savings. For example, we recently learned about one cloud provider introducing a new set of virtual infrastructure based on more powerful hardware. Cheaper and more efficient infrastructure was just a click away for one of our customers – their migration from old to new hardware was painless.However, to work through all these changes, your organization needs the right processes in place – processes that enable evaluation and understanding of these changes and how they could affect already existing services.The building blocks for a secure foundationThe most important aspect is safeguarding the services built on public cloud platforms and maintaining control of your data. So where do you start?One important step is building a secure foundation which contains the following five building blocks:Network Security and Containment  
Information Protection and Storage 
Governance and Compliance 
Identity and Access Management 
Security OperationsMany cloud providers have reference architectures that can be used as starting points, but they also have designs aimed to meet compliance needs such as PCI-DSS or NIST. The reference architectures cover all the above security elements, but only as part of the initial setup. Services deployed using a reference architecture might have security guardrails, but you still need to pay attention to the changes and security best practices for specific services or applications.These example architectures can also be viewed as a starting point for any organization, as there is a “no-size fits all” design. Therefore, it is important to understand the different cloud services you can use to ensure security and governance.  Among network security options, cloud providers have different services available that can be used to lock down and protect services, including DDoS protection features or even web application firewall services in addition to traditional firewall services.Because these networks are also completely virtualized, you can configure the network and security specifications as code. In some cases, the built-in functionality from the cloud providers is insufficient for certain compliance or security demands. In those cases, you might need to use third-party solutions to enhance functionality.What about protecting your data?Cloud providers all have services aimed at protecting data. By default, all data is physically encrypted within their datacenters. Beyond this, providers offer features that can even encrypt and classify data in-transit based upon conditions and patterns in the data. All data is configured for availability, which means data is replicated multiple times to ensure its availability despite a hard-drive failure, for example.Each cloud provider has different options for data redundancy across multiple data centers or geographical regions. For some services, such as IaaS or virtual machines, you can also use built-in backup functionality to backup virtual machines.To meet governance and compliance standards, providers define organizational policies to ensure the following conditions are met:Services are not exposed directly to the internet, internet but are instead behind pre-configured guardrails. 
Services are not deployed into datacenter regions that have not been preapproved by the organization. 
The required monitoring, backup, and security services are in place before offerings are released.These policies are useful to configure for data or services only to be delivered from a certain cloud provider, data center or region. They also ensure deployed services have properly configured governance, security and monitoring mechanisms.  Many cloud providers also have a built-in mechanism that can be used to map an environment against security best-practices, such as the NIST or CIS framework, but also against certification standards such as PCI-DSS. Both options provide a secure score or security benchmark feature that can map an environment against the cloud provider’s own best practices as well.Identity and Access ManagementIdentity and access management might be the most important element, as this also applies to end-users with access to certain parts of the cloud platform and SaaS-based services that the organization can access.Microsoft states that >99.9% of compromised accounts that use Microsoft identity service did not have multifactor authentication enabled. This feature is obviously important to enable both users and administrators with elevated access to the cloud platform. The providers also have different features that can offer more granular access through context-aware access as well as features that can provide least-privileged access or privileged access as needed.Many of the cloud-based identity providers are moving towards new authentication methods such as passwordless authentication using a security key to provide both passwordless and multi-factor mechanisms.Security OperationsThe final aspect is security operations. While the cloud offers many security mechanisms, they must still be managed as an integrated eco-system. There are a few tips to remember here:Configure logging for all changes made to the cloud platform(s), user authentication, changes and service logs. While some services have built-in logging, logs are not collected into centralized repositories by default. The cloud providers have mechanisms in place to collect logs centrally, but this still requires configuration.
Use the data collected to build predefined monitoring and alerting metrics, for example, in monitoring changes made by an administrator or end-user logging in from an unknown location or device. These logs can be integrated with the cloud provider automation framework to automatically remediate the situation. If a virtual machine is communicating with suspicious services, log data can be combined with an automation runbook to either isolate the virtual machine or lock down the firewall to stop the traffic.
Utilize different security posture APIs that provide alerts from the different security mechanisms within the platform. These APIs should be integrated into existing monitoring or ITSM platforms to ensure incidents are addressed.More and more organizations are now starting or in the middle of cloud transformations – and thus building new services using cloud-native tooling and more a DevOps-based approach. We believe that the same principle should be applied to maintaining control of the cloud environment – meaning a code-based approach for governance and security is essential. This allows more agility in making changes and provides documentation on what security mechanisms are in place in the current environment.Also, your organization should continuously evaluate new security features from cloud vendors to see how they can provide better overall security for your cloud transformation.To illustrate just how fast changes happen, consider the new capabilities introduced by the biggest providers:Microsoft has introduced a new DLP feature for endpoint devices. 
Amazon released a new network firewall service. 
Google’s new Voucher service can be used to secure container supply chains.But what new features are on the horizon? Which will be able to really help your business? And which ones will just be bells and whistles? Sometimes, you need an experienced partner to lead the way. TietoEVRY has led organizations of practically every size to the cloud, and yours could be next.", Marius Sandbu ,Cloud , 5.12.2020

In TietoEVRY you get the chance to figure out yourself, but with good support from leaders and colleagues, where you can best use your knowledge by trying out different tasks and projects.Less stressful interviewMy journey began in 2019 when I applied for a position as a graduate in Business/Economics. Little did I know where I would end up. Back then, the merge had not yet been fulfilled but was mentioned in media.After completing the gamification test I was invited to an interview in Oslo. The interviews were split over two days, where I was introduced to the other candidates and some future colleagues.I was able to relax and enjoy the interview experience and was positive surprised that the process was much less stressful than other interviews I been at. Some days later I received a phone call with an offer for the graduate position within PPA (Project, Program, and Advisory), which resulted in me moving from Molde to start building my career at TietoEVRY in Oslo.A few weeks before I started, I received information from TietoEVRY that both a mentor and a buddy would be waiting for me. They looked forward to my arrival in September, which made me even more eager to start my career within the tech industry.A warm welcomeMy first two days at TietoEVRY consisted of virtual take-off days. Here, around 170 other newcomers from all the Nordic countries were gathered for a new adventure. In addition to getting an introduction to the organization we got to know each other, had fun, and worked together to solve different tasks!Later that week, my leader at PPA Shaleen Sebastiampillai had gathered our unit to get to know each other better. We eat a nice dinner and got challenged by Shaleen to a game of darts.At the office, I was slowly starting my new role as a project manager. And it was a lot to learn. My mentor and I had multiple meetings where we decided on the next steps and what I needed to learn. Which helped me concentrate and learn the right things for my role.TietoEVRY encourage to boost your experience and career in different departmentsAfter working as a graduate for a short while, I was proposed to assist in a role for implementing an ERP system. This meant that I had to change department if I wanted to be a part of the new project. In TietoEVRY you are encouraged to not limit your knowledge and change departments if it’s necessary to boost your experience and carrier. Taking initiative to some meetings with my possible colleagues and some of my old colleagues I decided to change department.Life is like a box of chocolatesI was both excited and nervous to leave my department after only one month. However, this concern quickly disappeared as soon as I meet the team. On the first days, my new unit celebrated the signing of a large contract with a cake and hand sanitizer gel. Here they also welcomed me to the unit, and they were glad I chose them.Nowadays my tasks consist of meetings, preparing for a Microsoft certification, and my two different roles in the new ERP implementation project. I recently fulfilled a Microsoft certification which I have been practicing for during the autumn.I do a lot of different things, among others, we have done a PoC (Proof of Concept) for a vendor invoice automation process, and I had an introduction to my new work tasks. One day, one of my leaders even asked me to participate in a short photo season for a webinar about Cloud Solutions. Little, did I know we were supposed to create a short pitch/commercial movie!Like Forest Gump, you never know what that piece of chocolate you just picked up taste like. What I do know, is that whatever I do, I have people supporting me and who believe in me. Here, at TietoEVRY, you can truly spread your wings.Read more about the Graduate Program", Sebastian Gustafsson ,Meet our people , 4.12.2020
How a regulated debt register helped reduce Norwegian consumer debt by 8% in just one year,/en/blog/2020/12/how-a-regulated-debt-register-helped-reduce-norwegian-consumer-debt-in-just-one-year/,Data / Egil Årrestad / 3.12.2020,"Previously, it was easy to obtain consumer credit, not just from one lender, but several. Aggressive marketing led to a significant growth in the consumer lending market, more defaults, and an increased number of debt victims. Norwegian authorities initiated several measures to dampen the growth, and a new debt information law with the introduction of debt registries was one of those measures.Services launched in July 2019, and 16 months later we can determine that it has been a success. Total consumer debt this year has been reduced by 8 %. The corona situation has contributed to the reduction, but there is little doubt that the debt registries has provided better insight to consumers into their own debt and reduced risks for the banks. TietoEVRY with the subsidiary Gjeldsregisteret AS is a central contributor in this regard.Gjeldsregisteret has a license from the Ministry of Children and Families in Norway to operate as a debt information company. With the introduction of debt registries, the authorities aim to prevent debt problems in private households by enabling banks and other credit providers to access information and better understand how much credit and consumer loans a loan applicant already has. This provides financial institutions with a better basis for credit decisions, at the same time as loan applicants can expect better financial advice from lenders on their own loan capacity.Business modelNorwegian authorities considered both public and private models for operating debt registries. They landed on a private model and facilitated competition for debt information services in the Norwegian market. It is stipulated by law that debt information services must be operated in separate companies. Besides Gjeldsregisteret AS, TietoEVRY has also established services the banks can use for the reporting of debt information to the debt information companies. Two other debt information companies have also established themselves in the Norwegian market.The purpose of the debt registries is to facilitate more precise credit assessments by providing banks, municipalities and other law regulated users a tool to assess how much consumer debt loan applicants have. Quality is secured by the fact that all financial institutions with operations in Norway must always report debt information in a standardized manner to the debt registries. Initially, services included unsecured consumer debt, which mainly consists of credit cards and consumer loans. The authorities will, during 2021, consider if the service offering shall expand to other types of debt, for instance, mortgages and car financing.Expansion is expectedGiven the experience with a total reduction in unsecured lending thus far this year of NOK 14.8 BN (-8 %), from NOK 190,8 BN to 176,0 BN, there is a high probability that the registries will be expanded. The banks also report that debt registries are functioning very well and have become an important tool in credit assessments. They contribute to prohibiting the acceptance of consumer loans or credit cards to people who have too much-unsecured debt.Tool for consumers to better handle their economyFurthermore, experiences from Gjeldsregisteret show that most people use the tool to obtain better control over one’s own economy. All consumers can safely and securely log into the debt registry via the national ID-Portal and obtain their own debt information. Gjeldsregisteret alone has had more than 1.7 million logins from consumers. This provides a basis for sorting out unused credits, and good documentation if one is in a difficult position and in need of debt counseling. If errors are observed, the consumer can easily report to the bank, and the result is that quality in the register is continually improved.Insights into the debt situationGjeldsregisteret has also established service with insights based on statistics and analysis. This provides public authorities, researchers, financial institutions, municipalities, and other interested parties with good insights into national and regional development in the debt market.Example for other Nordic countries?The establishment of regulated debt registries with reporting duties for all financial institutions has shown to be a success in Norway. Lenders and consumers have, in a short time, been provided with a new tool that improves the information concerning a loan applicants’ total unsecured debt. The possibility to obtain more debt than one may handle has been significantly reduced. This leads to fewer debt victims and reduced losses for financial institutions and is thus a win-win for both parties.The challenge of debt is not unique to Norway. The situation is similar in Sweden and Finland, where no regulated debt registries have been established so far. It will be interesting to see if the other Nordic countries will follow the Norwegian example and consider equivalent solutions for reporting and application of debt information.Visit our page gjeldsregisteret.com to learn more or get in touch with me.", Egil Årrestad ,Data , 3.12.2020
How can gamification increase diversity,/en/blog/2020/12/how-can-gamification-increase-diversity/,Digitalization / Anna Gulliksen / 1.12.2020,"Did you know that in a survey of 2000 bosses 33 percent said that the time it would take for them to decide whether or not they will hire, is 90 seconds? Short time for a strategic decision? It also showed that we base our first impression (and potentially future decisions) 55 percent on the way we dress, act and walk, 38 percent on how we sound and speak, and only 7 percent on what the person actually says.Is it possible that we are unconsciously biased when making hiring decisions?It is a fact that competence is not defined by sex, age, ethnical background, religion or other personal details. With a general lack of skilled talent today, the market is employee lead. Organizations need to understand the importance of attracting this talent.Can new technologies, such as gamification, help increase diversity and candidate experience?Four years ago, our company was facing a big challenge. We knew that if we were going to deliver according to our promises to our customers and to help them succeed, we needed more competence in new technology. We needed large volumes of new graduates. And the competition for these people was fierce. Demand markedly outweighed supply.To attract our target group, we had to create an attractive recruitment process. We also needed a process that ensured that we found the right talents without taking gender or ethnical background into account – a fair and objective process. Communication was crucial since we had to ensure we framed our message to reach our target group – graduates within the IT and business economy. Our main message was dynamic but elegant, “Shape the future today”, and we built our communication campaigns with blogs, videos and other content relevant for the target group.We then turned the traditional recruitment process upside down and used gamification. All candidates that met the formal criteria (relevant education and age) received our gamified test, assessing cognitive thinking, problem-solving, and personality traits. Next, we conducted video interviews and looked at their cv. All was designed to be as unbiased as possible. It wasn’t until these steps were completed that the selected candidates were invited to meet their potential managers.Humans are biased, but that did not matter. All candidates that we invited to meet the managers were employable. They filled the formal criteria on education, problem-solving, cognitive skills, personality traits, location, etc. The managers could use their famous gut feeling, without the risk of recruiting the wrong people.Why is gamification such a good tool for recruitment?Firstly, it works for all types of psychometric tools. It provides a richer picture and predictive data on a future hire. The quality of hires increases by 50 percent using such tools.Secondly, fairness and equality. Imagine you have an open position with ten requirements. Female candidates typically will only consider applying for such a position if they fulfill at least eight of the ten criteria. Male candidates, however typically will apply if they meet just five of the ten criteria. Additionally, dropout rates for underrepresented groups continually increase as we progress later into the hiring process. If our process to assess relevant competencies uses a more engaging format, in a less stressful and ultimately more joyful and fun environment, dropout rates decrease.Thirdly, when we are hiring, we may end up with one happy candidate, the one that got the job, and 99 disappointed candidates that did not. Over the years, we have had nearly 10000 applicants of which we have hired about 10 percent. That means that there are 9000 dissatisfied former candidates out there. Of those, 92 percent think that gamification positively reflected our employer brand, meaning that we have more than 8000 potential ambassadors out there. Our gamified recruitment process improved the candidate experience and subsequently the employer brand.What about diversity from the gender perspective?Over the years, the ratio of females to males in our graduate hires has altered between 36 and 45 percent. That´s a good result in the context of the tech industry where the usual female to male ratio is between 22 and 25 percent. For our internship program, the female to male ratio is 50 percent, and some of the programs have up to 13 different nationalities. Gamification with a structured approach increased diversity and our attractiveness as an employer.As the famous Swedish entrepreneur, Jan Stenbeck said: “Tech beats politics Machines can help humans”.Are you interested to learn more about the gamification tools we use for attracting young talents to Tietoevry?

Graduate Program provides a quick way to adapt to the work culture,/en/blog/2020/11/graduate-program-provides-a-quick-way-to-adapt-to-the-work-culture/,Meet our people / Hung  Nguyen / 26.11.2020,"In the summer 2020, I started to work as a Big Data trainee in the Healthcare Data Platform team at TietoEVRY. When my manager encouraged me to join the Graduate Program, I did not hesitate. It offered me a great opportunity to continue to work on interesting tasks with the same familiar team and to dive deeper into TietoEVRY’s culture and networks.I have really enjoyed working here. I am part of the platform development team building a new framework for so-called Cloud infrastructure management. From the beginning, I have also been assigned to handle specific customer cases. This has been both interesting and demanding, and I am proud of it - making billable work right from the start is cool!Culture of equality gives everyone same possibilitiesWhat I especially appreciate here is the fact that I can really choose what to do. There are more possibilities than one could imagine. For example, the learning session resources in the Graduate Program are like a huge tray offering tasty bites for everyone. While some sessions are recommended for all participants, it is our own responsibility to select the courses we are interested in.Overall, the importance of finding one’s own path is both well communicated and supported here. Still, there is no rush or too much pressure. It is very nice to know that entering a certain position does not define your entire career. The freedom to choose strives from the culture of equality. We all have the same possibilities, and everyone chooses their own path. Therefore, I feel that I can fully contribute and make a difference here.I really enjoy working in a company where there is basically no gap between managers and employees. Communication is equal and people are extremely helpful. Special thanks are due to my team members who have supported me extraordinarily well. No one abuses their power but uses it for the common good.Growing personally and professionallyBecoming a high-level expert in an international professional environment, where basically everything is done in networks, requires both personal and professional growth. Especially networking and interaction skills are very important for success. This is well arranged in the Graduate Program. Normally, participants have two dedicated senior colleagues supporting them, a so-called buddy who helps with day-to-day affairs and a mentor who supports professional growth.I have a mentor who has taken on both roles. He is both very supportive and highly experienced. It is my honour to get help from such a person who is dedicated to encourages me to learn more. We have a very close relationship as we are both located in Tampere and share the same room.My experiences are very positive. I saw this as an opportunity to understand and adapt to the work culture. So far, my expectations have been met. Everything is very well organised from both a technical and a personal perspective. I feel good here.If you are considering to apply to the Graduate Program, I highly recommend it!Apply now for our Graduate Program 2021! Read more here.Stay updated and be among the first ones to hear about our job openings for young professionals by joining ourfriends @TietoEVRY Finland

Time to scale your cloud investment and level up your business,/en/blog/2020/11/scale-your-cloud-investments-and-level-up-your-business/,Cloud / Johan Torstensson / 25.11.2020,"Those who were already on ""stand-by"" with scalable cloud solutions adapted quickly to the situation without their business being severely disrupted. But as we know, this wasn’t the case for everyone.The expense of limiting yourselfThings have changed, for everyone. The organizations that continue their work in the exact same fashion as before will soon realize that they’re not using their investments to their full potential. The same organizations are the ones who will see themselves get overtaken by more agile and responsive competitors.Cloud represents endless possibilities, and yet some companies and organizations paint themselves unnecessary borderlines, by forcing themselves to choose between either public or private clouds. But cloud isn’t about choosing, it's about cherry-picking.Exit the testing phase and propel your cloud transformation forwardThe connection between an organization’s cloud maturity and its return on investments is clear. It is only when you scale up that you hit the jackpot in the terms of agility, being able to meet your customers on their terms, and giving employees the freedom to work anywhere and anytime.   The degree of cloud maturity continues to increase year after year, especially when it comes to strategies and transformation. However, there is a great number of organizations that are stuck in the endless loop of pilots and POC:s (Proof Of Concepts), where the same theory is tested over and over again.Not only are they wasting time and money, but they’re also risking falling behind their competitors. Scaling up is perceived as too complicated to get started with, especially for those who need to focus on their existing environment at the same time.The good news is that scaling the cloud doesn’t have to be complicated. The trick is to first invest time and energy in creating a good, solid foundation, to set a direction that is connected to the company's overall strategy. Once this is done, you start creating a plan. The creation of a plan doesn’t have to be difficult either – especially if you are backed by a good partner who can help steer you in the right direction.Read also: How to adopt cloud services securelyThree tips for scaling up your cloud solutionsView cloud as a change in your entire delivery model and your way of working, not as a technology: This is the chance with a capital C to introduce a completely different kind of continuity and agility throughout the organization.
Get help: Cloud is not your core business, but it is an enabler for those who want to take their core business to another level. Choose a partner who offers the best-fit cloud foundation and cloud solutions to suit your needs.  Each organization's opportunities are unique to them, and it is important to have a partner who can create tailor-made and scalable solutions from the hybrid, public, and private cloud all the way to edge computing

Social work and ICT: complementary couple,/en/blog/2020/11/social-work-and-ict-complementary-couple/,Meet our people / Tatu Heinonen / 20.11.2020,"I started my university studies in computer science but ended up switching both the university and major to study social work. While they seem worlds apart, I have drawn from field work experience from both of them in my everyday professional life. The work I do now in product management within social care information system development, means I get to work at the intersection of the two professional areas that interest me most.While not traditionally seen as areas that would combine, it is very rewarding to take advantage of experience from both social work and ICT and put them to good use. Training and work experience in the field are of significant benefit in the design of social care customer information systems while the ability to visualise technical possibilities and requirements helps considerably. A perfect example of this is the formulation development proposals which is naturally easier for software developers. Indeed, my job is often to act as an interpreter between the social work and information technology worlds.Information system supports social welfare professionalsThe most important function of a customer information system is to make everyday life easier for professionals and enable them to focus on their core work. Workflows must be logical, service processes must be easy to navigate and flexibly implemented, and quantified recording must be natural and valuable. We know that when work basics fail or impede progression, job satisfaction decreases. This in turn is reflected in the daily lives of both the organization and those accessing social care. Valuable resources should not be wasted fighting tools.Close customer cooperation and industry expertise are paramount in addressing challenges and improving functionalities. We strive to design user-friendly packages that take into account the needs and wishes of the end user, and this is one of the major goals and outcomes from the current testing of our next generation Lifecare customer information system. We are working closely with our customers, social welfare professionals so we can work together to make the system meet their specific working demands.Transformation requires changing the operating cultureWhile extensive projects and reforms concerning social welfare have been numerous in recent years, successful implementation of change is not easy, especially in a sector where the balance of resources is often tight. Projects including the revised Social Welfare Act, the client data archive for social welfare services, and formal registration and the reform of service tasks have all been put forward to varying levels of success.I have been fortunate to be able to see up close a number of large projects which our clients have implemented against tight deadlines. As a system supplier, our expertise in social care in general and specifically in future national reforms and interpretations of laws and guidelines has played a critical role in these projects.While major reforms are primarily changes to an organization’s operating culture via the modification of processes to support operations, they must include and consider employees. Without the opportunity to influence the direction of change, information and training provided to employees will not be successful. In reality, the information system is only one part of a large whole, it is not the core.Effective services must be at the centreInformation systems contain vast amounts of data and the challenge for the near future is to understand how we can better use this information. Critical questions must be asked, and answered: is data only collected for archive purposes or for review at meetings?  Is it used to develop activities, or can it contribute to better understanding the effectiveness of existing services?The good news is, we don’t have to wait until the future to answer some of these questions. Our reporting solution, Fakta provides a wide range of information and when used to full potential, the data analytics could enable the targeting of early support services more efficiently than ever. Importantly, data can also contribute to identifying and preventing possible future problems.We know there is already a wealth of information, but it should be harnessed in an effective way that contributes to the development of social services. We continue to work with projects that have been launched at a national level, bringing our expertise to the table to further enhance social care service delivery.Read more about our healthcare and welfare solutions and services", Tatu Heinonen ,Meet our people , 20.11.2020
Combining my tech interest and business experience through Tietoevry’s Graduate Program,/en/blog/2020/11/combining-my-tech-interest-and-business-experience-through-tietoevrys-graduate-program/,Meet our people / Lukas Bard / 20.11.2020,"My experience so far has been very good. I feel more and more comfortable with my choice of joining the Graduate program at Tietoevry. I feel that I’m on the right track and accelerating my professional growth thanks to the support of my colleagues and mentor.The increased societal focus on cyber security is evident and interesting. Businesses rethink their business models which translates into an increased focus on protecting organizational assets, as innovations. Disruptive technologies and increased connectivity make information one of our time’s most valuable resources.The merger and transformation of Tietoevry have fascinated me more than expected. I often see colleagues identifying synergies and setting common goals which makes it interesting and fun to imagine the potential of two competent backgrounds becoming one. Even though we are in a special time due to the global pandemic and merger, I still felt a warm welcome from the Cyber Security team, the Graduate program and the organization as a whole.Flexible and digital mindset, warm colleagues and good supportOne of the advantages of working in a modern organization like Tietoevry is that the employee is surrounded by flexible and digital mindsets. For instance, many of my colleagues are located around Sweden but we feel close and collaborate effectively. The colleagues I have reached out to and interacted with so far have been supportive and taken their time to help me in my learning journey. I have also been given a carefully selected mentor who has been central in providing me with good support and discussing mutually interesting topics.Currently, I manage several activities in different projects simultaneously. I work both on projects with customers and on internal projects targeted at improving internal processes. I continuously work closely with our Security Manager department and other colleagues in the Cybersecurity function to effectively cultivate my competence within that field.I try to interact with colleagues in different departments to build a network and understand the organization. For example, I have been in frequent dialogue with my co-workers at the Innovation Center and provided my perspectives and experiences on how to manage innovations in a systematic manner.I believe that one of the greatest strengths of a large organization lies in the synergies generated between its members. Therefore, it is exciting to be part of the journey and transformation where the collective potential of 24,000 colleagues is increasingly being synergized at Tietoevry. This will further strengthen our global capacity and also drive a local presence in our daily business.A generalist, focusing on understanding a broad range of activitiesBefore I joined Tietoevry I often strived to become as skilled as possible at specific things. Today I endeavour instead to become as good as possible at a broad range of relevant tasks. My goal is to be able to discuss many topics on a general level instead of being very specialized in a few. I believe the generalist role can be advantageous for me because it provides good conditions to combine my business experiences with the complexity of the cybersecurity field.That’s why it’s good that our Graduate program offers different tracks, where you can either try out different roles, widen your skills in several areas, or simply become a specialist in something if that is what you prefer.Why did I join?I joined the Graduate program because I saw the potential to utilize my technical interest and business experience in an alluring organization that consists of 24,000 experts globally (including 4 700 in Sweden for that matter) – supporting customers that operate across more than 90 countries.My goal in joining the program was to get a rewarding learning environment. The program provided me with a network of other Graduates in the Nordics which enriches my experiences. A carefully chosen Mentor and Buddy are also helping me on my learning journey. I have also been able to get broader exposure as a Graduate and dive into different contexts to explore areas of more interest for me. I believe these opportunities will help me to design an interesting and sustainable competence profile that our customers find attractive.The next stepsMy next step is to increase my involvement and take ownership of more activities in a customer project where I work together with a Security Manager in Tietoevry. I will also take the exam for the AZURE 900 Fundamentals certification and continue the learning path in the Graduate program.Are you interested in joining the Graduate program at Tietoevry? Here are some useful tips for a good start based on my experience:Dare to be curious. 
Ask interesting colleagues and departments for an introduction. 
Study the culture, and the internal Hub and listen actively to people’s discussions during the coffee break or lunch (digital for the time being, but still as important) to understand the context of the organization. 
The sooner you grasp parts of the culture and context in the organization, the more comfortable you’ll be in interacting with colleagues and eventually customers.Read more about the Graduate Program", Lukas Bard ,Meet our people , 20.11.2020

CIO means Career Is Over. Or Maybe not?,/en/blog/2020/11/new-roles-of-cios/,Cloud / Johan Torstensson / 13.11.2020,"When tackling the challenges we face – not least in connection with the pandemic – we need to become better when it comes to learning from other people’s experiences, as well as sharing our own insights. And sharing is exactly what I will do here, and at the same time dispel the lame, old joke that CIO stands for Career Is Over.The perils of celebrating quick resultsWhen I served as CIO a few years ago, the role was already undergoing change, where the role description no longer really matched what I spent my days doing. The availability of new technologies and the opportunities they presented changed the organizations’ demands on the IT department, resulting in myself and my IT suppliers spending far too much time putting out various fires.An exponential and technology-led development is taking place, and I can in real time see this development affecting our customers and partners, as well as our own organization in TietoEVRY.The digitalized and data-driven world we live in has created new opportunities, which in turn has led to IT organizations facing significantly greater demands when it comes to speed and agility. The amounts of data being handled are increasing enormously, and the so-called business-critical departments are usually quick to catch on to new trends, because who doesn't love a ""problem solver"" who always delivers quick results?To put it bluntly, one can say those quick decisions and quick results are celebrated, while contemplation and reflection are seen as a necessary evil. The more we celebrate quick solutions, where we buy cloud by the pound online without further hesitation, the more time our CIOs must spend acting as firefighters. This is downright foolish; any new digital solution needs the same level, or higher, of stability and protection against cyber-security attacks as the organization's existing IT environment. We all know the real final cost of an unstable and insecure solution – time, money or even lost customers.Give and take, all the way to the board roomI've said it before, and I'll say it again - technologies and data in themselves are not good or bad; it's all about how the technology is handled and used. The amount of data is constantly increasing and for companies and organizations to continue to benefit from all the possibilities of digitalization, different parts of the organization must work more closely than ever before.Those who run the business itself and members of the board have lots to learn from the CIO's experience of the company's IT environment, and our CIOs will never work as quickly as we need them to unless we invite them in to understand the business.When we start to view the CIO's role as being just as critical as the sales director's, and as someone who is responsible for the central platforms that our business relies on, we will see a completely different organization being born, where the CIO's time can be freed up and go from fire extinguisher to a proactive key player in the team. This requires understanding from both sides – give and take at the highest level – but trust me, it’ll be worth it.Confidants rather than colleaguesThe CIO who shoulders the opportunity – and obligation – to deliver the digital data platforms (that will help the business build innovative solutions) will be seen as indispensable by the rest of the organization. When the CIO takes on this role, the need for the entire IT department to become an integral part of the business becomes a ""must"" instead of a “nice to have”.We can no longer have isolated IT departments; – they need to be a part of the business in a way that makes organizational affiliations secondary. Confidants instead of colleagues. The boundaries we have previously set need to be erased, along with the idea of ""us vs. them"". Once this is accomplished, you’ll get an IT organization that focuses on business benefits instead of supplier management; in other words, as a CIO, you service your internal customers.In this hypothetical but not unlikely future, increased customer satisfaction cost savings and won deals are celebrated collectively – not the number of fires put out. In order for the entire IT department to take on its new role, it is necessary to evaluate which partners can deliver what is required.Partly in terms of competence and solutions, but the biggest challenge of all is deciding on which partner(s) to work with; which one can handle the daily operations with high quality and efficiency? It’s then, and only then, that our brilliant CIOs finds the much-needed time to get to know the business, the purpose of the organization, and make use of that knowledge to come up with even better choices for how the organization will succeed.As soon as we’ve fixed this, the CIO will definitely have a career on the rise, and the lame, old joke “Career Is Over” is likely to become obsolete – about time, I say.PS: Do you want to know more about how to proceed with your cloud transformation? Don’t miss our on-demand webinar with our cloud expert Christopher Wiborg.

The Fundamentals of Cloud Data Platforms,/en/blog/2020/11/the-fundamentals-of-cloud-data-platforms/,Data / Teemu Ekola / 13.11.2020,"Today, massive amounts of data are being created with ever-increasing speed. This data has a lot of value if it is understood. To analyze these enormous amounts of data, a new kind of Big Data infrastructure is needed. The infrastructure is best utilized in scalable cloud environments, and we call this modern version a Cloud Data Platform.Complex and abstract things, such as vast computer systems, are often described with the means of analogous real-world examples. For Cloud Data Platforms, the real world has a nice analogy: A cloud data platform is essentially a (data) logistics network. Suppliers are the various information systems generating data.Distributors, in turn, are the data pipelines consisting of integrations and automated data transformation tasks delivering the data to stores ready for consumption. Stores are the data warehouses or Data APIs that serve the (data) products. They can be browsed through a catalogue — a data catalogue.Finally, the consumers are the data reporting tools and solutions, various applications or data analysts and scientists who use data to train machine learning models, for example.Ok, sounds understandable — hopefully. But what has happened in the industry to make cloud data platforms possible? What has happened that was not possible before? Well, let’s get into it.The emergence of Big Data analyticsFirst of all, we’re working in an industry where probably three of the biggest megatrends in the whole IT industry meet — that is cloud, big data and AI. It is an industry where the world’s largest companies fight fiercely and where 18-month-old technology may be deprecated.The speed of change and development is just massive. It is also an industry where enormous open source platforms reside in symbiosis with the vendor-specific offering.In fact, big companies commit to open source projects with hundreds of dedicated developers. A good example of this is Apache Spark. Due to this, the business logic is somewhat different from the traditional software product industry. It would be pure stupidity to compete with the largest players in the game, so the key is to be able to use the provided technology, and continuously adapt with the change.The reason why these companies are interested in putting such a huge effort on big data and AI technology development and tools is in the end very clear. These companies eventually get a lot of revenue from the usage of their cloud. The best services and tools attract users, and really the only way to create those great services for big data is by scaling.Frameworks in the cloud enable scalabilityManaging and analyzing big data is all about scaling. Within this area massive leaps in frameworks have been taken during the last ten years. Distributed file systems have enabled us to manage massive amounts of unstructured data, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) being the game changer initially.The data lakes that lie in the center of data platforms are essentially distributed file systems. The management and control, as well as interfaces to access the files, have been improved a lot, but the basic idea is the same — to provide a storage space where the user (the engineer) doesn’t need to understand and implement the tedious and complex problem of replicating data without losing it, and without having more than one view of it.Another framework-level enabler has been the data processing frameworks that again take away the need to understand the complexity of parallel processing. Or put it the other way around, let the user (again the engineer) focus on the data analytics or machine learning algorithm development. The framework can worry about compute cluster initialization, node-to-node communication, task scheduling and optimization, and many other tasks that are needed to make a cluster of multiple Compute nodes look like the algorithm is run on a single server.In the early days of Hadoop, MapReduce was the framework, but quite soon the in-memory processing framework Spark took over. Now the usability of these tools has been developed, and big data tools are offered as readily usable services like Databricks.The beauty in these frameworks is basically the same — the framework genuinely takes care of the initialization and scaling of a whole compute cluster for the time compute is needed and runs it down when it is not needed anymore. For the people who are working in the industry, this is already everyday life. But seriously, this is pretty cool — and advanced.In addition to these beautiful frameworks, the cloud has genuine and tangible benefits as a platform. For example, Microsoft Azure has Databricks (as well as the rest of the needed cloud data platform services) available as a managed service, which means that the resources Databricks runs on are automatically up to date with the latest operating system versions and security batches. That’s something that is causing a major burden and cost of maintenance for solutions relying on a self-hosted virtual machine infrastructure.Why is the Cloud Data Platform the transmission line of data-driven transformation?One of the biggest trends in organizations is to become data-driven. Becoming data-driven means being able to analyze data and base decisions on the analyses.Again, being able to analyze the data means that data and analytics tools need to be available. A typical situation in organizations preventing this is that the data has gotten siloed in various systems, and it is not available for analytics. It might also be that the management of the data is done manually, and adding new, even publicly available data sources is slow and expensive.This will often result in a situation where newly hired data analysts or data scientists lose valuable time looking for, cleaning and understanding the data. And in the worst-case scenario, if a common platform is missing, the machine learning model that is finally built is only deployed on the data scientist’s laptop without any possibility to leverage it in a wider scope, and with no one else updating it.Here is where the cloud data platform comes into play. It is a system to orchestrate the data for analytics or third party applications. Typical logical parts of a cloud data platform are:An integration layer managing the integrations of source system data to the data platform.
A data storage layer, typically a data lake, as also unstructured data is widely used.
A data modeling layer, which logically consists of both the data model and a modeling tool.
A data publication layer, which typically has both a cloud data warehouse (or data marts) and data APIs.
A data pipeline management component, which is used to define the data flows from source systems to data products on the publication layer.
A Big Data processing component, which is often used in multiple roles such as to process (for example clean or mask) the data in the data lake and for advanced analytics.
A data science environment to build machine learning models, train them, validate them, deploy them into production and finally automate the deployment.
A Data Catalogue, for users of the data platform to browse the data products available, understand the way how they are created and even to give feedback for other users about the data products.
A monitoring component. Like all vast production-ready IT solutions, a cloud data platform has tools to monitor the operations of the platform, meaning that the components are running error-free, but also checking that the data flows in the pipelines and its quality is as expected.However, there are emerging technologies that are about to change this somewhat stable structure. One of them is the lake house concept, which we will be discussing in another blog article soon.Final wordsOk, hopefully all of you who had no previous experience of cloud data platforms now understand that they are essentially data logistics networks, which orchestrate the data for analytics or applications.And by the way, if the parties working in the data logistic network are talking different languages, the work quickly becomes slow and frustrating — that’s why we need to have a data glossary.If the suppliers are allowed to deliver their goods with or without a description of the content (metadata), if they are using whatever names they wish about their products (master data), or if nobody has any control on the quality of the goods the suppliers deliver (data quality), it is soon apparent that the logistics network will halt. We obviously need someone to govern the whole thing — so, govern the data.", Teemu Ekola ,Data , 13.11.2020
Diving into unfamiliar technologies and industries - my journey as a graduate,/en/blog/2020/11/Diving-into-unfamiliar-technologies-and-industries-my-journey-as-a-graduate/,Meet our people / Simen Berg / 11.11.2020,"In December 2019 I started working for Tietoevry’s Financial Crime Prevention team through the Graduate Program. Since I had already finished my business degree and my manager was as eager as me to get me started working in the business development team, I was lucky to be onboarded early.During my final year of studies, I had the opportunity to work on a consultancy assignment for (then) Tieto. This was a great experience and the project piqued my interest for Tieto as a potential employer. When I later found out that Tieto and EVRY were joining forces to become the largest IT company in the Nordics, the newly merged firm quickly rose to the top of my list of potential employers.As a graduate student, I had been through several exhausting recruitment processes. When it came to Tietoevry, I was positively surprised by how welcoming the process was. It made me feel like they were genuinely trying to find out how and where I could bring the most potential to the company, as well as how the company could provide the most value to me.On the final day of interviews Gunnar Koren, who’s Head of Financial Crime Prevention, came into the waiting room. He had just been informed about the process and had 30 minutes available in his packed schedule, so he went to see if there were any interesting candidates available. After his introduction of the position I had seven minutes left before my last interview, so I took him to the side and expressed how interested I was in working with Financial Crime Prevention.Two days later, I was asked when I could start!Today I am working in a field that I had never even heard of a year ago, and with technologies I had absolutely no experience with. Every single day I learn something new, which I love. When I started the position, I was looking forward to the day when I would feel like I knew everything, but now I realize that I hope that day never comes.To be a part of Tietoevry’s Graduate Program has been a major advantage for me as a rookie in the working life. Not only do I get a lot of opportunities to learn and be a part of exciting projects, but I also enjoy that part of the program also focuses on networking activities. In a large company such as Tietoevry, there are so many different sections and hubs of knowledge which you get access to by expanding your network. The people you form connections with will teach you new things and utilizing their knowledge will oftentimes make your job a whole lot easier.After almost a year in the job, I have had the opportunity to work on a lot of interesting projects. Some of these them include the implementation of a new CRM system, developing a comprehensive market analysis, planning a big customer conference, and planning a development strategy in the midst of a merger process.Thinking back, I could not have been happier with the way my career has started. Joining the Tietoevry Graduate Program has truly kick-started my career as well as given me lots of experience that make me feel confident about the direction I’m headed in.My recommendation to students in their final year, whether in business or tech, is to start your preparations early. At this very moment, you may not need to know exactly what you want to work in for the rest of your career, but you should make sure to find an employer that will give you the opportunity to explore and perhaps find out. For me, that place has been Tietoevry and its Financial Crime Prevention team.Final 3-word summary:Three words that describe my time at Tietoevry so far: Exciting, challenging, and most of all, FUN.Read more about the Graduate Program", Simen Berg ,Meet our people , 11.11.2020

During those three months, I got involved in many interesting projects. However, as sales processes and contract negotiation lifecycles are relatively long, I only got to finalize a few of them. Joining the Graduate Program is a great opportunity to continue what I have already started here, and gave me time to ponder the direction of my future career as a lawyer.Although I love my work here and believe that TietoEVRY could really be my future workplace - I am asking myself the difficult questions about my future. Should I take the most common path and go work for a law firm as most newly graduated lawyers do? Should I stay as an inhouse lawyer as I have really enjoyed the practical way of working? What is the right choice to make at this point as there are so many different possibilities?I guess I just must keep my mind open and do what feels right. I am super glad to be able to tackle my dilemma thanks to the Graduate Program as it gives me valuable experience from IT field and supports my personal growth.Having both a buddy and a mentor is priceless!What sealed my decision to join the program was the moment I heard that all the participants get their own buddy and a mentor, who support our personal and professional growth.Buddy is my trusted friend, one of the younger lawyers from our team. We have open relationship and she helps me with practical issues and shares her experiences.Discussions with my mentor are more career-oriented and goal-directed. Despite my mentor’s extensive experience, this is still my game. I am the one in charge and it is my job to pinpoint the areas where I need guidance.All this feels great and gives me tools to grow as a professional. Having both a buddy and a mentor is priceless! I hope that the feeling is mutual, and they also benefit from our discussions.A bunch of new information and best practicesEagerness to know more and more is one of my key drivers. I´ve already joined common learning modules like Public Cloud and Azure. As a future lawyer, I also need to understand the business and the technologies we utilize.Also, Onboarding days, common calls and learning sessions have spiced up my days and given possibilities to meet other peers online from across Nordic countries. I am also eager to meet them face-to-face at some point when it’s possible during these exceptional times.I have already learned a bunch of best practices with the support of both the Graduate Program and my own awesome team. For example, understanding what is worth doing and what is not would be difficult alone. I now know how legal works in a large international company and how can I best help our business in complex projects.Even though I still have some big questions in my mind, I feel at peace. My gut feeling says that everything will go exactly as it should. The Graduate Program will truly be a unique experience that I will cherish in my memories for many years to come.Sign up to Friends @TietoEVRY and apply among the first ones for our soon opening tracks for Graduate Program 2021!Get a taste of #TietoEVRY life by following us on Instagram!", Jenna Lammi ,Meet our people , 10.11.2020
Cloudifying people’s everyday lives through DevOps,/en/blog/2020/11/cloudifying-peoples-everyday-lives-through-devops/,Meet our people / Hans Kristian Flaatten / 10.11.2020,"The upcoming cloudification seen from a DevOps perspective?DevOps did not appear out of thin air but gradually evolved in parallel as cloud providers like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud appeared. They removed the necessity for dedicated teams for networking, compute, and databases and enable everything as self-service, on-demand through an API. It is possible to adopt DevOps without Cloud but it requires much more effort and there are many pitfalls. As organizations moves to become more agile and adopt DevOps practices, they will find their benefit of cloud services increase many times.No days are the sameMy mission is to bring Developer and Operators together in what we call DevOps. I believe that everyone is allowed to have fun while working – even in the largest and most traditional of organizations. In order to achieve this peak agility, we need to stop working as independent silos and start working as one team – that is what DevOps being all about. What my teams are responsible for is building these DevOps platforms that teams can work autonomously throughout the entire lifecycle of the application.I like to make a difference which is one of the things I love most with TietoEVRY. I can make an impact on applications and systems that are used by millions of people daily. Some of our modern society’s most critical systems like payment and communication are built and operated by us. Each day we continue to invent and improve! No days are the same.In order to become better we must learn and shareI know that in order to become better as a person, professional, organization and as society we must be learning and be sharing – continuously. In my teams we always work together to solve any challenge and we happily share our experiences – good and bad – between ourselves and the rest of the organization. Only then can we unlock our true potential. We typically don't stick with the established rules we dear to do things differently.Since joining TietoEVRY I have been able to apply my learnings from truly agile development teams onto some of the largest enterprise organizations in the Nordics. They said it could not be done but we showed them that it was possible!

Multi-cloud is becoming the digital backbone,/en/blog/2020/11/multi-cloud-brings-a-new-level-of-complexity/,Cloud / Johan Torstensson / 9.11.2020,"As multi-cloud is fast becoming the key digital infrastructure for many, I want to discuss the potential pitfalls in this trend.Multi-cloud could turn into multi-silos because data is not connectedMany organizations underestimate the complexity of maintaining and developing a multi-cloud environment. Now, there is a chance to make that work. But CIOs need to step up and take charge of the responsibility for cloud transformation as well as the multi-cloud platform.Cloud is the engine now – the engine of business. The amount of data and new applications is growing exponentially, and that is why the CIO needs to take responsibility for creating a fast and nimble platform connecting the data sources to enable the organization to utilize the data to get valuable insights. The CIO should be the third CxO in the top leadership troika together with the CFO and CEO.In my opinion, one of the biggest challenges for CIOs is to deliver a true multi-cloud environment that allows seamless computing and data traffic as well as the opportunity to move workloads and data from one cloud platform to another. However, the journey towards multi-cloud environments is complicated and has many risks for creating silos of unconnected data rather than multi-cloud environments.Adding the importance of the network in this environment, and there is a new layer of complexity. Also, we see digital transformation evolve in systemic areas where downtime isn’t allowed, like healthcare and manufacturing in general.Multi-cloud is an ecosystem game in which digital trust is a mustTo adopt the best technologies and tools to create a new digital business, organizations must seek partnerships and apply a new operating model to accelerate application development and increase automation.The CxO troika needs to prioritize digital trust.Multi-cloud is opening your digital infrastructure to other stakeholders – not only vendors but all partners in collaboration. There are risks that need to be managed for the digital infrastructure to become a success. Managing data and digital risk is an essential part of the trust needed for multi-cloud. I see the linkage of sustainability also in the digital trust discussion. Among the Finnish and Swedish respondents, 42% were taking the environmental impact such as energy consumption or CO2 emission into account when implementing their cloud strategy. However, only 36% of Norwegian respondents answered yes to the same question.The request from our cloud customers is about energy consumption as well as lifecycle management of hardware. We of course take that seriously. If we as service providers don’t, we will not be invited to the conversation at all. My personal view is that sustainability will become a given – like security.Feel free to get in contact if you want to discuss further.Watch a cloud livecast recording where our customers share their insights!", Johan Torstensson ,Cloud , 9.11.2020
OpenStack deployment,/en/blog/2020/11/open-stack-deployment/,Cloud / Marcin Nicpon / 9.11.2020,"If you want to learn more about the OpenStack environment preparation, please have a look at my previous blog post.OpenStack installer selectionAs the first step we need to select best installer of OpenStack for our needs. There is a lot of commercial and opensource solution in the market like: Mirantis Fuel, RedHat OSP, Kolla-Ansible, OpenStack-Ansible, Packstack, Devstack, etc. Installation can be done also manually following steps listed on openstack.org. To ensure using minimum resources and extend installation if needed Kolla-Ansible was selected. It provides production ready tools, working out of the box, is highly customizable and automated.Additional libraries, tools and configurations needed for selected installerAdditional network configurationsWe have assigned two network interfaces to the VM in NAT mode in previous steps. It may cause some connectivity issues as both interfaces have default gateway assigned. To fix potential problem we need to release IP address from one of them and make the change permanent. This can be accomplished by:editing /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml filesetting new content:and applying the changes:Next step is also to make sure DNS client configuration is correct. Some corporate DHCP settings or default Linux configuration may cause the further connectivity problems. To avoid those, let’s follow couple of the steps:remove symlink leading to DNS stub:then create file with desired content:here is how my DNS client configuration looks like:After these changes please make sure that internet access is still possible.Additional virtual storage volumes preparation [Optional]If our intent is to attach multiple volumes to the VMs or install VMs from ISO files on OpenStack there is a need for additional space for block storage provided by cinder service. Following screenshot show creation of 50 GB virtual storage drive, which is enough for our example deployment.Fig1. VirtualBox VM virtual disk volume creation window  Operation can be performed only when VM is powered off. After adding the disk, we need to start VM and run following commands to prepare second disk for cinder by setting LVM on it.More information about cinder configuration for Kolla-Ansible deployment can be found here.OpenStack deployment and running simple VMAs our environment is ready for deployment, now we are ready to install OpenStack using Kolla-Ansible. Detailed guide is available here, the following steps were used in our case:To avoid issues with running installer, symlink, linking Ubuntu’s preinstalled python3 to path expected by installer needs to be created:Optionally /etc/kola/passwords.yml file can be changed if user wants to change default OpenStack admin password which is defined in line “keystone_admin_password”:Selected latest Kola-ansible requires Ansible v2.9, where default Ubuntu package installs version 2.5, so this needs to be upgraded:In next step we need to change some parameters /etc/kolla/globals.yml file:The most important for our deployment is to change/enable the following:Where:enp0s3 is internal management interface used to connect OpenStack services together

Fast – secure – frictionless: Can your digital identity replace biometrics?,/en/blog/2020/10/fast--secure--frictionless-can-your-digital-identity-replace-biometrics/,Data / Jonas Kullgren / 4.11.2020,"Inherence, or “something a person is” is one of the three security factors used for secure user authentication. Today, face recognition and fingerprints are used to sign you into your online banking app. How can your digital footprint and transaction data be used for payment authentication?BackdropA joint industry statement signed by leading players in the payments industry in August 2109 applauded the EU Commission’s efforts to reduce fraud numbers by using strong customer authentication (SCA). At the same time, the co-signers raised concerns about the implementation impacts of SCA. They asked the Euro Banking Association (EBA) to encourage the financial industry to develop data-driven inherence (“who you are”) factors. One year earlier, at its summit in Japan, Gartner presented the concept of “corroboration”, meaning that your digital identity is confirmed by “real-life events”. This can be translated into “data analysis on transactional behaviour”.When the Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2) was fully implemented across Europe in September 2019, one of the major topics of discussion was strong customer authentication (SCA) and how it would affect end-consumer behaviour. The discussion is still ongoing, as the SCA requirements have been postponed until the end of December 2020. It was also intensely discussed how the financial industry could secure customer confidence in payments without affecting the frictionless experience in executing a payment transaction.To carry out a payment that does not fall under any of the exceptions in the Regulatory Technical Standards (PSD2 RTS on SCA), a two-factor authentication procedure must take place on the consumer side. It must include at least two of three required identification measurements:Knowledge (e.g. pin code or password)
Ownership (e.g. phone, OTP device or card)
Inherence (e.g. fingerprint or other biometrics)Entity profiling as a safety mechanismTietoEVRY’s Financial Crime Prevention Team helps our customers to build profiles on entities to protect end users from becoming victims of fraud and to safeguard institutions against criminals seeking to use financial systems to conduct illegal activities.By combining data points from several sources, we can create entity profiles that make us (almost) certain of who is trying to execute a transaction. With consent from the end customer, we can use data on, for example, tracking, where, using analytics techniques, accelerator sensors measure how devices are used. Unsupervised machine learning models can help us estimate what transactions are likely to occur on an entity level.While our Financial Crime Prevention Team develops rules on known fraud patterns, supervised machine learning is used to forecast emerging risk patterns. By comparing historical transaction data with real-time data, performing a real-time analysis on entity level, and comparing it with peers, we can determine the identity of the entity. What’s more, by understanding the network surrounding the person with the help of other digital markers, we create a “who you are” model based on types of information other than biometrical data.So, what are we saying?Is it possible to replace fingerprints or face recognition technology with data analysis? Can we use authentication data in connection with transaction data and consumer behaviour in such a way that it is secure and fast enough to reduce friction by building entity profiles? The answer is yes – and yes. With the data we have, we can secure your transaction, protect you from fraud and safeguard institutions from being exploited by criminals by determining your identity.We protect your data and your identityWhen applying advanced analytics (AI) and profiling to transactions, it is imperative to take GDPR into account, as these processes often imply the use of personal data (data-driven inherence). At the same time, from a regulatory perspective one must bear in mind the far-reaching obligation financial institutions have to prevent financial crime. The use of personal data for identification and authentication purposes is crucial to avoid fraudulent third-party events, cybercrime, and financial crime. GDPR (Recital 71) specifically refers to fraud prevention as a legal ground for conducting profiling. As with all processing of personal data, it should be noted that potential user profiles used for financial crime prevention should not be misused for non-compliant purposes.Against the backdrop of GDPR, one must not forget that the profiling and use of personal data is solely used to protect individuals and financial institutions from criminal events. In this context, the use of data-driven inherence combined with biometrics and behavioral data is in fact a key prerequisite to protect individuals and personal information from criminal third parties.Click here to learn more about Financial Crime Prevention in TietoEVRY.", Jonas Kullgren ,Data , 4.11.2020
Technology is the key to curbing climate change,/en/blog/2020/10/technology-is-the-key-to-curbing-climate-change/,Sustainability / Satu Kiiskinen  / 30.10.2020,"This year, climate action has, for obvious reasons, been overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic debate. While we focus on solving the acute crisis, however, we cannot allow ourselves to forget one of the greatest challenges of our time – climate change. It is important that we support ambitious action to counteract climate change at every level. In this work, companies and decision-makers are the main drivers.The EU pandemic support package makes the speeding up of climate-friendly solutions very topical towards the end of the year and next year. The three billion euros assigned to Finland provide an important opportunity to support digitalization and to create carbon-reducing and climate-friendly solutions.Technology companies are at the centre of this effort. Technology allows us to provide different parts of society with solutions that reduce emissions to a significant extent. New technology, for instance blockchain, IoT, AI and cloud services, make the efficient use of data possible and allow for services with reduced carbon emissions – they provide a way to reduce the consumption of energy and resources, to optimize logistics chains and to utilize the available capacity more efficiently. Real-time data helps us to improve information access and analysis, and also to solve problems in support of climate action.Technology to support urban centres – can data help us achieve a carbon-neutral Finland?Public actors, cities and municipalities in particular, have a major role in creating a carbon-neutral Finland. One concrete example is a joint project undertaken by the city of Vaasa, Vaasan Sähkö, Wärtsilä and TietoEVRY: a data platform that provides a comprehensive picture of the city’s emissions and models the results of different kinds of climate actions. This allows the parties to define the most efficient and cost-effective ways to reduce emissions and also to provide transparent tools in aid of decision-making. The aim is to make Vaasa one of the first carbon-neutral cities in the world – and there is no reason why we should not proceed to do the same for other cities in Scandinavia – and globally. Find out more about the project from our expert Fredrik Jansson’s blog.In Norway, our data platform helps to make the city of Trondheim carbon-friendly, using an application that allows residents to calculate their own climate footprint directly on the basis of their consumption and lifestyle. The solution has been developed in cooperation with local businesses and service providers. We also have every prospect of bringing these solutions to other Scandinavian countries.Today, eco-systems and a culture of experimentation are very important in producing innovations. Any action to counter climate change requires the cooperation of a number of different sectors as well as multidisciplinary expertise. The solutions in Vaasa and Trondheim were created as a result of cross-sectoral cooperation.Satu KiiskinenTietoEVRY, Managing Partner, Finland", Satu Kiiskinen  ,Sustainability , 30.10.2020
Activate and secure B2B sales in times of change: learnings from the manufacturing sector,/en/blog/2020/10/activate-and-secure-b2b-sales-in-times-of-change/,Data / Emmanuel Raymond / 29.10.2020,"Welcome ""new normal”, where B2B sales is significantly more difficultThe way we do B2B sales challenging enough before the pandemic. Take the manufacturing sector as an example. Over the course of the last few years, Asian competitors have increased their pressure on spare-part replacement sales, capturing more and more revenue from the installed base. As an example of this increased competition, it is not uncommon for cheaper spare-part alternatives to catch your customers’ attention by appearing first in any Google search.  We’re also living in the online world more than ever before. The sales force used to meet and greet their customers face to face, but, as the pandemic has unfolded, we’re are increasingly finding ourselves in remote sales. Customers are also expecting the sales force to contact them with a targeted approach – offering correct products at the right price and the right time.  So, competition is increasing and it’s hard to stand out … but it doesn’t have to be that way!Transform B2B sales from reactive to proactive: surge ahead of the cheaper, reactive competitorsManufacturers no longer have the monopoly of selling spares and services across their installed base. The competition has already moved online! It started with search engine optimizations (SEO) a few years ago, and the pandemic has only made matters worse. Typically, half of all quotations never turn into firm orders, so manufacturers are painfully aware that the competition has increased over the last few years.   The winning strategy is to secure sales earlier, contacting customers when the time is right on their side and closing the deal before the customer even starts searching for replacement spare parts.   The solution is to make use of the one asset your competitors don’t have: customer data.Turning data into action for B2B salesManufacturing companies have something that their competitors are lacking: years of installed base data. Their experience of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems is making it possible to analyze years of sales data, to get a very precise view of the materials, quantities and timing of future sales. This is a direct representation of the world using the most refined level of detail. It allows them to anticipate customer needs, secure stock on critical items and conduct relevant discussions up front.   This “algorithm-driven” approach is relatively new to the manufacturing industry, and you may be wondering what to do with all the data. If the hypothesis is that we can indeed predict a customer’s upcoming demand by using existing data, how can we test it to see if the hypothesis is indeed correct?Six baby steps towards making sure sales activation can actually workWe ran a short development project with one of our manufacturing customers. Using our agile background, we proposed running through just two sprints: one to prove that the maths actually works, and the other to implement the first activations. It is very important to be ready for the possibility that the maths does not work once you get into it. But, in this particular case, we were able to prove that it worked across two very different types of geographies. This was great news for the developments that followed!   Our customer had several ideas in mind that we described as a business hypothesis, using a standard agile framework:Improved customer experience: use algorithms to make us smarter and also more human! 
Improved relevance in customer discussion when you know their exact needs. 
Improved forecasting when determining the highest potential for upselling.Prefer a video over the written word? See the recording of a webinar in which we open up this methodology with Ingo Leufgen from Neles.Keep a long-term view in mind while defining short-term actions for B2B salesThis most important action you can take is to just get started – and evidence suggests that this is even more critical in times of crisis and uncertainty. Accurate prediction models will help your sales team to focus on the right things. For example, in our pilot project it was possible to predict what customers won’t buy. Further, the accuracy of sales forecasts improved significantly and we were able to forecast sales with 80% accuracy.  The data-driven approach creates new opportunities. By using data you can get quick wins, but becoming a truly data-driven company won’t happen overnight.

We truly have a positive impact on the whole Finnish society. This gives true meaning to my work, and I feel like I have arrived home. This is what I want to do. Realizing this in just a few weeks is both amazing and meaningful to me.Before the graduate program, I was not sure about where the future would take me.Applying learned skills to the real worldMy path has not been the straightest. I am an airplane technician and soon-to-be graduated IT automation engineer. So, I have already studied quite a lot.Therefore, it is mind-blowing to see how the things I have learned during my studies relate to the real world, and in a whole new context. What is even more fascinating is understanding how much I can develop in this everchanging field of expertise.I am on a cumulative learning curve. Day by day I get more demanding tasks to do. Sometimes I even feel desperate – how can I ever become as great an expert as my colleagues? Being a member of one of the world’s best teams in identity and access management is challenging and very motivating. I know that the better I get, the better I can help people avoid the dangers of the Internet, for example.A leading philosophy that motivates to exceed myselfWhat I wrote above also describes well the principles of leading here at TietoEVRY. We are all always supported, treated kindly as part of the community and help is always available. Still, we are expected to make our own decisions and be self-directed right from the beginning.Support for newcomers is also very well organized. For example, I joined the first Graduate Program arranged here in Finland. It is a well-structured, extensive orientation to TietoEVRY´s culture, tools and work practices. It has proven to be a great way to integrate into a small town-sized company and share thoughts with peers in same situation. If I had any extra hopes, I would love to spend even more time networking.I have three dedicated people helping me in taking my first steps. They all seem to follow the same leading philosophyI chose to apply to TietoEVRY because I saw that it offers many opportunities as an industry leader and offers extensive support to newcomers.

First P27 services coming on line – Guide for banks operating in Sweden,/en/blog/2020/10/first-p27-services-coming-on-line--guide-for-banks-operating-in-sweden/,Digitalization / Micaela Vernmark / 27.10.2020,"Bankgirot has formed the backbone of Swedish payments and driven payment innovation for many years. This is set to change when P27, the new Nordic Payments Platform, is rolled out starting with SEK batch payments. We have put together a short guide to help you understand what is happening in the Swedish market and what banks should consider.The field of playFirst, let’s look at the different players and their role in the Swedish market:The Nordic Payment Council (NPC)
P27 Nordic Payments Platform (NPP)
Swedish Riksbank (RIXInst)The newly formed Nordic Payment Council (NPC) is a non-profit organization responsible for the payment scheme rulebook for SEK and DKK. NPC is building the rails for a coherent Nordic payment infrastructure. All banks that want to use these rails need to be a member of NPC. You can register on NPC’s website, but remember banks need to have the full foundation in place and be ready to set a target date for starting to follow NPC schemes when you apply.Moving to the next level of players, clearinghouses, or CSMs as they are called, will process and settle all payments according to the NPC rulebook. Both P27 Nordic Payments Platform (NPP) and the Swedish Riksbank (RIXInst) have stated that they will follow the NPC payment scheme rulebook and act as CSMs. Today we have nine different CSMs in the Nordics, so one objective of the whole project is to reduce the number of clearinghouses and simplify the payment infrastructure, as well as building a larger marketplace to keep up with International competition. In addition, banks and technology providers will need to collaborate to connect the technical parts and build superior end-user experience, as well as to create new service offers.Up to now the million-dollar question has been whether P27 will acquire our old CSM - Bankgirot - or not. We now know that the answer to this is yes. Bankgirot’s services will continue to exist in some ways, but we need to track the effects of the integration in the long run. In addition, P27 doesn’t yet have a full clearing license from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, “Finansinspektionen”, and cannot start payment processing until one is approved. Therefore, one hands-on piece of advice is to stay active in different forums to gather as much information as possible or get a consultancy partner to do this for you. Start now since time is running out and banks normally need lots of it to adjust to changes.One thing that is clear is that to ensure success, all the different parties need to work in close collaboration, including banks and vendors. Each has their own part to play and challenges to overcome.Decide what to offerFor banks one challenge is to understand what P27 means for the business. When developing a strategy to capitalize on P27, it’s important to keep in mind that banks can still choose which services to offer their customers. Therefore, it’s the perfect time to look at new value propositions and how to bring added value to payments. Despite the NPC rulebook covering extensive requirements, not everything will be mandatory. For example, banks are not obliged to handle all Nordic currencies.Participating banks need a strategy setting out the services they want to provide, which communication channels to use, how to handle security and gateways, as well as reporting options. It’s important to make sure that new services don’t just comply with P27 but offer something extra to ensure market competition. This is also a unique opportunity to innovate and modernize your payments offering, so “If you’re in the business of making things, be in the business of making things great” as Disney CEO Robert Iger points out.Changing paymentsAnother area set to change is alias payments, also known as OCR payments. This common, Swedish payment method uses a Plusgirot or Bankgirot alias connected to a bank account to make payments with high reconciliation. Once P27 is live these alias payments will need to be converted into IBANs when moving funds cross-border. This is needed in order to comply with the NPC schemes that are harmonized with international SEPA standards. Banks need to think about how they will handle this conversion.With P27, the payer’s bank will need to validate OCR/RF references. Swedish OCR numbers will be mapped with a SCOR reference to again comply with NPC schemes that are built to resemble SEPA and the ISO Standard. Payments will be rejected if the SCOR reference isn’t correct. All banks will need to find ways to validate the SCOR to avoid payment rejections by the payee’s side. It will still be possible to set the hard or soft reference validation that exists today. However, it is up to the bank to decide whether they want to process alias payments in the new platform or not.Things you can do nowThe first thing a bank need to do is to build a strategy based on the products and services that it wants to offer and then try to leverage the opportunities brought by P27. Remember that each bank can choose their own path. Again, this is an amazing opportunity to build new innovative services, so don’t settle for less.Here are three things banks can do now:Talk to your current IT-provider. How can they support you with the change to P27? What connectivity options, communication channels, security, file conversation possibilities are available to you? What will your onboarding plan look like? Make sure your vendor can set you up for future growth.
Map all current payment flows and services connected to your customers. How many customers use specific Bankgiro services today and who are they? What will happen if this service is remove or modified? Analyze the importance of the services you provide now and those you want to provide in the future and add this to your payment roadmap, along with a strategy for when and how to launch new services. Analyze both happy and un-happy flows and how you will handle the flows during the transition period. Remember that NPC is not building technology or services, that is up to you.
Apply for scheme membership with NPC through their member forum on their website. In order to apply you need to be confident that you have all technicalities in place, and you need to give a timing for when you can go live.Big changes are coming up, but with planning and preparation your bank can leverage the opportunity of the new payment platform. How we perceive change can affect its outcome, so embrace it with an open mind and set your sights on success.

Going green with Edge Computing,/en/blog/2020/10/going-green-with-edge-computing/,Cloud / Mats  Eriksson / 22.10.2020,"Edge computing is typically promoted to solve latency issues related to new emerging services. I believe that the impact of edge computing is much more significant. In a recent white paper, I modelled how it will help reduce global energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions caused by data transport by up to 60%.Soon 20% of global electricity will be used by data centres, data transport & devicesEdler and Andrae[1] state in their research paper that 20 per cent of global electricity in 2030 will be consumed by data centres, data transport & devices. This is worrying – and it is not caused by bitcoin or by you binge-watching Netflix.The vast energy consumption is due to society at large getting connected in all aspects. Your refrigerator and garbage bin will start talking on the Internet, while your PowerPoint files are often transferred across the globe without you even knowing it.The amount of energy used to transport data is roughly equal to that consumed by data centres globally. Oddly enough, this fact is mostly absent from discussions on how the IT industry impacts green gas emissions.Edge compute could save 60% of data transport energy consumptionI believe that the most important aspect of edge data centres is the potential they offer to reduce the energy footprint of our data society.The key to edge computing is to analyse the flow of data through networks and optimise compute workloads. Optimization of workloads will significantly reduce energy consumption related to data transport. In some use cases I explored, the total energy consumption saving potential was as much as 60%. These aspects are further outlined in my white paper, for those interested in the models, math and assumptions used.I urge everyone operating digital services to take a deeper analysis of their potential contribution to a greener world.My white paper, “Going green @ the edge: Cost modelling of edge compute”, offers a model to analyse the energy footprint of your data-intense services. I’m confident that edge compute solutions will help you reduce the data processing power you use.You might also be interested in watching the recording: Webinar: Telco Cloud Edge Computing: How to boost the development of data-rich applications with open edge platform?Or reading the related blog: Emerging edge computing – unlock the value of your data", Mats  Eriksson ,Cloud , 22.10.2020
OpenStack deployment – Preparation of the environment,/en/blog/2020/10/openstack-deployment/,Cloud / Marcin Nicpon / 20.10.2020,"If you want to learn more about the history of OpenStack, software stack itself or its business considerations please have a look at my previous blog posts.Hardware requirements and Operational system considerationsFirst, to install OpenStack user needs a Linux machine. It can be either a virtual machine (VM) on a regular PC or a separate one. Minimum hardware requirements are as follows:2 CPU cores,  
virtualization support in CPU;
8GB of RAM and;
Internet connection
Virtualization (VT-x/AMB-v) enabled in your computer BIOS. Verify the settings described here in case of issues.However, all depends on what kind of application we are planning to use. To deploy more resource-demanding VMs much more resources may be needed.  Example infrastructure (with applications) described here needs at least 16GB of RAM, 4 CPUs and 100GB of disk space. In case of running OpenStack on VirtualBox, some additional resources may be needed for host OS, so the conclusion is clear - the more, the better.  OpenStack deployment on separate PC (recommended option) saves some of the resources and also is much more performant. This guide can be used also for this kind of deployments, just please skip the steps mentioning VirtualBox considerations.  In this blog, we will focus on the deployment of OpenStack as a VM on VirtualBox, as it can be applied to most of the modern PCs and does not require any additional equipment than our own PC.   To deploy OpenStack to our regular working PC (on top of our host OS) there is a need to use a hypervisor to place OpenStack VM on it. Depends on your PC OS there is a wide choice of open source and commercial hypervisors. For Linux hosted PC the most popular hypervisor is KVM/libvirt, for Microsoft Windows we have i.e. Microsoft Hyper-V.There are also hypervisors available for many platforms like VirtualBox, easy to use, open-source and available for Linux, OS X, Windows and Solaris. In that case seems that best choice is VirtualBox, which has dedicated versions for all Oss mentioned above (available here).Fig.1 OpenStack deployment on Virtual box – nested virtualization diagramVirtualBox and OpenStack host OS deployment and configurationTo setup VirtualBox please refer to the detailed instruction here and also complementary guide on its networking structure and configuration here.For our OpenStack deployment “bridged” or “NAT” networking models would be the best choice (ease of configuration and use). For “bridged” networking there can be some limitations, however, introduced by internet providers or corporate networks to use bridged networking as well as it may not work well with some WIFI interfaces (as it is actually not real bridging in this case). Regardless of its better transparency and ease of use NAT model was chosen for our example to avoid limitations.As the next step new VM needs to be created under VirtualBox environment (for detailed instruction please refer here or any other tutorial)Please find a couple of the important considerations below on VM parameters and minimal resources assignment, when creating VM to host OpenStack deploymentvCPU: 4 or more (more is strongly recommended) with nested virtualization enabled 
RAM: 16GB or more 
DISK: 100GB or more 
Network interface: 2 with NAT(optional) additional virtual disk for Cinder volumes: 50GBAdditionally, set the following options in VM settings:Enable PAE/NX 
Enable nested VT-x/AMD-v  
Enable nested pagingAt this point, the environment is ready to get OpenStack host Linux OS installed in the created VM. There is a lot of Linux distribution in the market which is working well with OpenStack (Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, RedHat, OpenSuSe or many others), however, because of ease of use and user-friendly interface, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS was selected for our deployment. As installation media we can use USB thumb drive) or ISO image which can be burned to physical media or attached to VM as virtual DVD-ROM drive. In case of VirtualBox most convenient will be to use ISO image attached as virtual drive. ISO file can be downloaded here. For installation guide please refer Ubuntu website.As a next step, we need to make sure that VM can access the internet. After logging in to the VM OS please run following command:Expected output, when connection works well:To access VM with regular SSH client and (OpenStack Web UI later) port forwarding in the VM “Settings à Network à Advanced” for first network adapter needs to be configured:Fig.2 Port forwarding rules configuration windowNext, we can use a favourite SSH client (PUTTY, MobaXterm, etc.) and login to VM Ubuntu as below:Fig.3 PUTTY connection configuration windowIn the next blog post, we will focus on adding to Ubuntu needed libraries and tools to run OpenStack, deploy OpenStack, as well as run our first application.Do you feel inspired?

Helping the customers become the digital champion of tomorrow,/en/blog/2020/10/helping-the-customers-become-the-digital-champion-of-tomorrow/,Meet our people / Jimmy  Karlsson / 20.10.2020,"My own journey started at TietoEVRY (or EVRY as it was back then) in 2014 as a consultant. Public Cloud, while the topic back then as well, was still a bit of unexplored territory. As customers grew their interests in the Public Cloud, so did mine.Thankfully TietoEVRY is full of opportunities and encourages you as an employee to evolve and change from your original role. The journey has now brought me into the role of a Principal Cloud Architect, working closely with my 24 000 colleagues.Being a part of a 24 000 strong team globally gives you a lot of opportunities. And as we are a global organization, a lot of different and interesting perspectives. In our Public Cloud section, we are working in a squad model, meaning there is no “boss” in the regular sense. This culture of equalism, collaboration and initiative gives everyone their chance to contribute, regardless of her or his background. Working in squads gives us all an equal opportunity to take initiative and lead, be it on customer cases or new exciting services we offer our customers.The tech as a travel companionThe technologies have enabled a lot of these new ways of working. Working with our big cloud vendors (Azure, AWS, GCP), with their big areas of services gives us a lot of opportunities to choose different solutions to different challenges. As an architect, some days revolve around drawing solutions on a whiteboard with the customers.The next day you’re building the Minimal Viable Product (MvP) with infrastructure as code and sending it thru the famous pipeline in Azure DevOps/Git Actions. As there are lots of different technologies and tasks to have under control, you cannot do it all alone. In TietoEVRY we handle that by having several “squads” and micro teams with different specialities, such as automation gurus, data engineer’s etcetera. In the end, this helps build the best possible solution for our customers.AI as a vital part of the cloud journeyAs the technology has matured a lot of it becomes more about explaining “how to cloud” instead of  “why to cloud”. That’s why presuming to know the next step in the Cloud Journey is close to impossible.However, an educated guess is that we will have a major focus on Machine Learning and AI going forward, this is due to a lot of data and services being moved to the cloud. We are then able to put all great Machine learning/AI services to use in their proper and most efficient way, giving our customer even more of a digital edge. As the data in the company belongs to everyone, we will work even more in different department at our customers, to enable them to become the digital champion of tomorrow. Or when we for instance make production lines more efficient at manufacturing plants, our customer is involved in choosing the right product in their shop.The Public cloud change rate is high and still accelerating. We are committed to the journey, having a lot of great and knowledgeable people, educating ourselves and taking the initiative to change our services and offerings all the time, helping our customers become true digital champions. This commitment makes each day as a Cloud Architect at TietoEVRY a new and exciting one.Wonder where next stop is? Why don’t you join the team and find out?We’re looking for cloud advisors & architects to join our team helping our customers with the transformation. Apply now!", Jimmy  Karlsson ,Meet our people , 20.10.2020
Carbon-neutral cities are data driven,/en/blog/2020/10/carbon-neutral-cities-are-data-driven/,Data /  Fredrik  Jansson / 20.10.2020,"In the urban setting, the primary mission of decision makers and public servants is to ensure the best possible environment for the cities’ residents and well as for the businesses, and for others visiting or working in the city. Therefore it is logical that combating the effects of climate change is highly prioritized by the decision makers as well as other stakeholders.Many municipalities have already taken up initiatives. For example, a network of carbon-neutral municipalities (Carbon Neutral Municipalities, HINKU) has been launched, and municipalities such as Helsinki, Espoo, Tampere, and Turku among others have set their own carbon-neutral goals.Cities both in Finland and across the globe have set ambitious goals to combat the effects of climate change. The need for change is explicit in every agenda. While the corona situation of spring 2020 has had some positive effects on emissions, experts remind us that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has still not decreased even though the world came to a halt.Read also: Innovations for the climateDifficult, but not impossible — good data management supports cities in climate workClimate goals are easier to achieve when action taken is based on the cities’ measurable data. This can be further accelerated by bringing together experts of different emission groups, technological experts, engineers, and other stakeholders to define the most effective measures.As many cities still lack their CO2 balance data, they have no overall view on their emissions in general. Thus, a broader picture of the current situation is required in order to take the right steps to make an impact — and to measure them against data.Practical measures should be focused on those that are particularly effective. Climate initiatives often become biased to the ones that are easy to measure whereas more complex or difficult issues might not be set any measures at all. It also might be the case that the focus is put on the wrong things, based on feelings or emotions related to the issue. The city budgeting is also likely to be built based on the previous fiscal year. National programs in Finland and the cities themselves are setting strict goals to combat climate change, but have difficulties to grasp the bigger picture. What could help in this situation?According to an interim report from the ICT working group for climate and environment, data will be a key factor in the cities of the future. A real-time status of the city’s performance may be obtained by using data collected by devices connected to cities’ digital infrastructure and sensors using IoT. This helps to direct the city to operate in a more efficient and environmentally friendly way that better serves the needs of the citizens.In order to control and reduce emissions, it is necessary to understand how they are generated. However, the related data on emissions is scattered to different sources and formats. In some areas such as the energy sector, the data is more uniform, but in other sectors it might be more arbitrary and difficult to measure. This is the case, for example, in the field of traffic. In addition to the technical data, understanding of human behavior and the feasibility of measures beneficial to the climate is required.In an experiment conducted in the Vaasa region in the spring, data on traffic and energy consumption were collected. Forecast models related to consumer behavior in traffic and energy consumption were also added.The collection of data alone doesn’t of course prompt action for change. Local organizations and the best experts with a deep understanding of the area are needed to assess the findings and to conclude the best practical solutions for carbon-neutral activities. Together with the Vaasa region expertise and expert partners we will promote the implementation of the lessons learned from the experiment.Read also: Vaasa city goes carbon neutral using dataA comprehensive view of the city’s carbon footprint as well as the ongoing and planned measures is required for managing urban carbon neutrality. This forms a basis for leading and managing changes needed. In order to make the most out of activities to combat climate change, we need to know which individual action is most efficient in terms of implementation as well as positive impact — and this is to be demonstrated in a measurable way. The cities share a common challenge of how to best maximize the positive effects of urbanization, and to use digitization and data to minimize the environmental impact of humans.What should cities consider on the road to carbon neutrality?

What does Cloud transformation mean for businesses?This question has been the talk of the town for the past decade. I find it amusing that only 10 years ago, it practically didn’t exist, and now it is all we ever talk about. Unsurprisingly, different organizations and people approach cloud from several different angles. Many define it as Services that are delivered through the internet.As a techy, however, I feel this slightly misses the point. For one, it completely ignores private clouds such as some big platforms on large ships. These can be equipped with for instance Microsoft Azure Stack Cloud platform that is able to function largely offline but still delivers cloud services.Cloud computing is in essence what IT infrastructure and platform experts have been trying to achieve for decades - paraphrasing the Wikipedia definition - the automation of resources to deliver IT services, whether it be by a private, hybrid, or public cloud model. This would really help bring to life the cherished goal of flipping the infamous 70% administration and 30% innovation ratio.2. What are the benefits of Cloud?The most important thing isn’t to just use cloud because everybody else is doing it. The main focus should be centered around goals and ambitions. The needs will always be subjective to the individual organizations. We've identified over a dozen cloud drivers through our experience with customers’ transformation projects and working with the technology. Aligning these drivers with your strategy will serve as a compass to stay on course in order to reach your goals.This is where one could benefit from an analytical framework such as what we call a Cloud Readiness Assessment, or Cloud Discovery and assessments, similar to the early phases of industry standardized Cloud Adoption Frameworks. These frameworks save a lot of organizations from pursuing the wrong tech, meaning you avoid wasting time and money while establishing solutions that are not really optimal.3. Where are other companies and industries in their cloud transformation journey?There is not one straight answer to that question.  Some are just starting to test the waters, others are running significant workloads in cloud, and a few haven't taken a single step towards cloud. Simplifying a complex matter is never easy, but you could boil it down to three main maturity stages:ReadinessCloud computing is very different from classic on-premises computing. Readiness is about not flying into cloud computing without a plan. Readiness is about evaluating what you need, aligning that need to the right technology, and make sure you have a plan to get there. Like any good plan, you would want to know what would be the consequences of undergoing the change - will you be saving capital, or will it cost you more? Will you actually get the benefits you’ve sought to acquire? Running discovery and assessments will reduce the unknown factors and help you mitigate risk.Some have systems running in cloud, but you might not have full control over everything such as billing, processes, and compliance. Do you know where your data is stored? Have you designed your environment to meet your SLAs?Do you have processes in place to control spending, monitor your systems – and if a service goes offline, do you have a mitigation plan? Some voices in the market have predicted that transitioning to cloud computing will reduce the need for hosting partners, maintenance, or complexity.But the truth is, nobody will tell you if what you’ve set up in the cloud is right or not. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, by design, don’t really know much about who uses their services and what they are using it for.GovernanceEstablishing control in the shape of cloud Governance, whether it be private, hybrid, or public, is critical to successful operations and will help you avoid steep costs, errors, and problems that could potentially be devastating to your organization.For instance, Outlook Online will provide a retention service that will keep your emails for as long as you like depending on the policy, but it is NOT a backup service. Should you be so unlucky to delete something by mistake, that email or document is gone. A backup however will periodically store an extra copy of data, so if a mistake is made, you can still get it back.When you finally have some systems running in cloud, you’ll want to seek out that amazing cloud-native technology. But what does it mean to be “Cloud Native”? My favorite example of this is a retailer I know of; they've taken the first steps to bring their web e-commerce environment into cloud but has not completely transformed it.On every Black Friday, their webshop is flooded with customers trying to get their hands on their sales.Even though their webshop is hosted in cloud, the underlying code is not built to automatically scale up by adding cloud servers as the traffic increases.Instead, they have a ticketing system which means you must stand in a digital line in order to finally get in. I don’t know about you, but I think a lot of shoppers will not have the patience to “wait in line” on a day like that.AccelerationIt’s about leaving a legacy behind and focusing on the service itself. That is why the third stage is the continuous optimization of your cloud systems and Acceleration. The innovation rate is so significant that keeping an eye out for new technology could be what gives you that advantage you’re looking for.4. How to begin the Cloud transformation journeyI’m hoping that if you’ve taken anything away from this post, it is that it’s good to take a step back and make a plan. Try to figure out where you are in your transformation journey but maybe even more important is to start a conversation.Reaching out to your partners, the vendors, or taking the time to start discussions internally is a really important step towards identifying your next move. So pick up a phone, join a video chat, or set up a socially distanced meeting, and energize your cloud transformation.Want more insights?Our cloud webinar recording available now: How to accelerate your cloud transformation.Check out ISG Provider Lens™ Public Cloud – Solutions and Services Report", Christopher Arsene de Jesus Wiborg ,Cloud , 20.10.2020
On an expedition to future possibilities - Graduate journey kicked off!,/en/blog/2020/10/on-an-expedition-to-future-possibilities---graduate-journey-kicked-off/,Meet our people / Niko Eklund / 19.10.2020,"During the program, me and my 100 peers all had the possibility to get a helicopter view of basically all the opportunities TietoEVRY offers. Right in the beginning, we were all paired up with our own personal mentor and buddy who are dedicated to helping us with basically whatever we need to know to succeed. Discussions with buddy have been very helpful when facing new challenges after the summer training.The Graduate Program includes several Learning Tracks to choose from. I joined the Specialist Track and I am looking forward to what it will have to offer.Everything is possible hereThis is how I feel right now. A global company with almost 24 000 colleagues has impressed me both with its vastness and the high level of expertise of the team members. There are hundreds of possibilities available, and that is what really thrills me.Of course, moving forward on your career always requires proactiveness and self-knowledge. Therefore, we have also started to learn reflection techniques - the 70-20-10 Model for Learning and Development has been a useful tool to boost our effectiveness by supporting all three types of learning: experiental (70), social (20) and formal (10). I have already noticed that learning by doing suits me better than sitting in lectures.The culture here encourages people to seek their passion and core competencies. Everyone here is helped to find a right job in which they can utilize their strengths in the best way. Seeing and hearing all this gives me motivation and trust that this is a place where I can grow and create my own path, where everything is possible.Network of talented peopleIt was great to join the first Graduate Program organized in Finland with a couple of other soon-to-be graduating or recently graduated colleagues from here! We all entered a living community of hundreds of peers, wonderful mentors, and trainers.Meeting new people is one of the most important things to me. It is great to get to know other young talents and experienced experts sharing the same visions and values. I also believe that good networking skills are very important for future career. It is somehow almost unbelievable that all the people I have met during the last months have been so nice. People are always willing to help, which makes meeting new people even more rewarding.All in all, if I were to compare the Graduate Program to something more familiar, I would describe it as an extensive orientation. But that does not give it justice. This simply is a unique way to learn about both work life and digitalization here at TietoEVRY.My journey as a Graduate at TietoEVRY has just started - I am building on my future here, with all the support I need.

Which direction is Microsoft taking for the coming years?  Reflections from Ignite 2020,/en/blog/2020/10/which-direction-is-microsoft-taking-for-the-coming-years--reflections-from-ignite-2020/,Cloud / Marius Sandbu / 15.10.2020,"I will here share with you some of the biggest announcements made during this year's conference and, why it is important to incorporate processes to ensure your organization is up to date on the latest innovation that the cloud providers are developing.Every year all the major cloud vendors are pushing out new services. As an example, Gartner found that last year Amazon Web Services alone announced close to 1900 new services, and Microsoft close to 1200 updates for Microsoft Azure and almost the same for Microsoft 365.  This development has just increased from year to year.While the impact of the cloud vendors introducing new services might be small for most customers, it is important to understand what value it can provide. An example of this is when the cloud vendors introduce new hardware for their underlying infrastructure, which provides better performance and can reduce the cost of overall customer IaaS based platform with 20%. Switching from older instances to new ones is not something that is done automatically but needs to be initiated from the customer side.The second aspect is that new services or updates can also introduce better performance for existing services. Like in this example. Or provide you with a higher level of security, as seen in this one.With all that in mind it is important to understand that, when adopting cloud services it requires a more proactive business in terms of understanding the new functionality that the cloud providers are offering since this can:1: Reduce cost of your services 2: Provide better flexibility and performance  3: Provide a higher level of securityNow looking back at Ignite, the focus from Microsoft’s announcements this year was aimed atHybrid and Multi-Cloud (Providing Azure Services in your datacenter and other cloud providers and integration of other services) 
 End-user experience (Providing better tools for working from anywhere but also automation tools for business processes)
 Security (Providing better support for the scenarios above with working from anywhere and better integration of multi-cloud support)Find the extensive list of all the announcements made at Ignite hereThere were some other big announcements such as Azure Orbital, which provides Ground Station As-a-Service for communication and control of satellites. Azure Communication Services, which provides video, voice, chat, and text messaging experiences integrated into your applications, websites, and mobile platforms was another one.But, let’s dive back into the main topics.In terms of Hybrid the biggest focus was on Azure Arc, which is Microsoft’s hybrid platform, where they aim to provide Azure services anywhere. As of now Azure Arc provides some key functionality, one is Azure Arc for Servers which provides management of Windows and Linux based machines and integrates them with Microsoft Azure. This provides management of machines such as monitoring, security & threat detection and desired state configuration using Azure Policies.Another service is Azure Arc data services which provides Microsoft SQL and PostgreSQL as managed services on top of a Kubernetes environment. This is also a key trend we are see that Microsoft will be pushing new hybrid services delivered as a set of containers on top of a Kubernetes platform.Then we also have Multi-Cloud and Security integrations, where Microsoft is pushing heavily from a security perspective. One new announcement is extended DLP functionality (built on Microsoft Information Protection) for Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS).  This provides DLP policies for 3. party SaaS applications which MCAS supports. Microsoft is now also integrating with Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services to collect security logs and alerts from the security features they offer to provide a unified view of the overall security state from within Microsoft Azure.In addition, Microsoft has also extended their coverage on mobile devices with support for Defender ATP on Android and iOS devices which provides threat detection. They now also provide a new VPN service called Microsoft Tunnel to provide App based VPN capabilities for iOS and Android protected with Azure Active Directory based authentication.From an end-user perspective there was a lot of announcements regarding Microsoft Teams improvements such as providing better SSO capabilities to native Azure AD application, built-in PowerBI application and integrated document signing capabilities. There was also a lot on Windows Virtual Desktop and providing better end-user experience with better protocol supports, and better management capabilities with Microsoft Endpoint Manager.A big change also was in the automation ecosystem with Power Desktop Automate where Microsoft is now providing Desktop RPA features as part of their automation framework as the other RPA providers have. This Automation framework can also be part of Microsoft Virtual Agents which is a bot platform essentially which can be easily integrated into Microsoft teams essentially making Microsoft Teams the main workspace for the end-users to initiate automated requests. Lastly Endpoint Analytics which is a cloud service that collects telemetry data from your endpoint to provide insights into the user experience.Looking back at all the announcements I believe that Microsoft like the other cloud providers has adopted and changed their focus on development of new services based upon the current pandemic we are facing and therefore focused on providing customers and end-users with new features and enhancements making it easier to work from anywhere.At the same time Microsoft is also seeing more COVID-19-themed attacks (Which can be seen here at the Microsoft Digital Defense Report, September 2020) and therefore, Microsoft are also extending their security portfolio across new platforms both cloud and mobile platforms to provide a unified view of the environment to more easily secure user access to services and data.", Marius Sandbu ,Cloud , 15.10.2020
How outsourcing of lending administration can boost digital transformation in the banking industry,/en/blog/2020/10/how-outsourcing-of-lending-administration-can-boost-digital-transformation-in-the-banking-industry/,Digitalization / Mattias Nilsson / 14.10.2020,"Mattias Nilsson, Senior Manager Service Delivery in the Credit Solutions and Services unit at TietoEVRY, shares five ways outsourcing of lending administration can help you focus and support your digital transformation.Financial services have changed a lot in recent years with customers demanding smooth onboarding, fast payments and digital self-service. Banks need to focus on core processes and invest in digitalization – or risk losing market share.One way to have the time to focus on these essentials while speeding up digital transformation is to outsource lending non-core processes to a partner. Several big players in the financial market have teamed up with TietoEVRY Credit Financial BPO unit to do just this. Based in Kalix in the north of Sweden, the unit is a strategic outsourcing partner that focuses purely on credit administration. We provide origination services, contract lifecycle services, and retention and loyalty services.At the time of writing, we’re in the middle of a pandemic and we’re all learning how to adapt to a new reality. When we come out the other side, outsourcing will be even more relevant, especially for certain processes. So, here are five ways outsourcing of lending administration can help financial institutions and enable them to concentrate on their digital transformation.Cut costs and invest in transformationBased on 30 years of experience within lending administration, an outsourcing partner like TietoEVRY has efficient processes and invests in supporting tools across several customers, so the cost of these services to you is a fraction of what it would be if you did it yourself. For example, our team helps banks handle variable volumes, cutting costs as well as managing peak loads in an efficient way. What you save can be invested in modernizing your business and transforming your products for the future.Spend time on innovationAdministering financial products is personnel demanding. To support the full credit lifecycle a bank needs to employ credit administrators as well as staff experienced in compliance, risk and management. Working with an outsourcing partner frees up your employees’ time and they can drive product development and your core competencies instead.Shorten time to marketIn our experience, financial institutions want to strengthen their portfolio and launch new products quickly. An outsourcing partner with proven short time to market is an important asset. Banks can focus on developing new products and services, instead of hiring personnel and investing in tools or customer service. In the digitalized world, demand shifts fast and a short time to market partner could be a big advantage in driving digitalization.Reduce risksWith a proven and compliant administration partner, you do not have to spend time making sure you adhere to compliance rules and regulations – that’s all taken care of by the outsourcing partner. And at TietoEVRY, our Nordic team really understands local regulations so we can offer much more complex processes such as administration of estates, fraud and debt restructuring.Access skilled experts and increase customer satisfactionMany companies struggle with employee attrition and a lack of competence across all business areas. With a strategic outsourcing partner you can access expertise knowledge and deliver high end customer satisfaction in a digitalized world. For TietoEVRY, being based in the Nordics makes us an ideal partner for Nordic financial players. Despite a rise in self-service, consumers still want personal customer service, especially when dealing with important or sensitive issues. This is when local presence and local knowledge really helps to meet expectations.

Working from home? Attackers are too,/en/blog/2020/03/working-from-home-attackers-too/,Cybersecurity insights / Monica Verma / 13.10.2020,"The outbreak of the Coronavirus has been declared a pandemic. One of the key measures, as advised by national authorities, is to create physical distance between people to minimize the risk of spreading the infection.With the exponential increase of coronavirus infection over the last months and more people working from their homes, cyber attackers have already started to abuse fear and panic to spread malware and defraud victims:The Brno University Hospital in the Czech Republic, which was also one of the COVID-19 testing facilities, was hit by a major cyberattack in March. The consequence was that individual systems started to fail, leading to an immediate computer shutdown in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak.Monica Verma, Chief Information Security Officer, TietoEVRY Financial services, provides some guidelines to ensure continued security whilst working from home.“We are living in surreal times. A security mindset is more important now than ever. It is vital to create a comfortable work environment and secure digital interaction. Do not underestimate the psychology of security or lack thereof.”Securing home office amidst coronavirus pandemicHow can you protect yourself and your organization digitally whilst working from home? Here are some basic but highly effective measures you can take.Security mindset is more important now than ever. First of all – remember you are at work! Make sure you have a comfortable zone where you can work undisturbed.
Be more vigilant and wary of ongoing scams, phishing campaigns and clicking on suspicious links that are related to Coronavirus. Attackers are using fake Coronavirus domains to lure and scam people seeking information about the virus, and to target people with the goal of spreading malware, stealing digital identities, etc.
Threat picture – evaluate your home office location and any inherent risk. Evaluate your surroundings and implement the necessary precautions. Be aware of who is present nearby and might be listening or observing. 
Protect your access rights, your computer, your working area and yourselves. Remember to log out when you leave your computer and be aware of storing the equipment in a safe and secure location.“In the midst of one of the worst pandemics our generation has experienced, we are seeing an increase in phishing campaigns and fraud, as attackers actively abuse the fear and panic in the society.”Always ensure your devices are up to date. Make sure all your devices including personal routers, your anti-virus solutions on your devices, etc. are up to date. Employees working from home should use a company-approved device for office work.
Ensure that you follow best security practices with regards to encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit. Use HTTPS or end-to-end encryption whenever available or necessary. In case of sensitive or critical business applications, ensure you connect via a VPN. Amidst global challenges with VPN connectivity due to the pandemic and extensive home office, it is critical that you understand the difference between and use of end-to-encryption, thereby reducing dependency on VPN.
Employees connecting through their home Wi-Fi must ensure that they have a strong password, and to avoid using public or unsecured networks, such as at cafes without VPN. Ensure your Wi-Fi is set to use WPA2 encryption only.
Use two-factor authentication, preferably with the authenticator app or hardware token. This is one of the most important practices to secure your accounts. If not possible to apply always, ensure to use it whenever and wherever possible, particularly with all sensitive and critical applications.
In case of suspicious email, do not click and please report to your security department or your vendor’s anti-phishing email address right away. Remember – at this point you are the “Human Firewall”.Continued security is essential for business continuity, particularly towards critical societal infrastructures and services such as healthcare, finance, energy, etc. It is vital that all security leaders ensure similar security maturity as before. In some focus areas, a higher security level is necessary during this pandemic, such as vulnerability scans, patching, detect and response, and security incident management.To ensure the safety of all employees, TietoEVRY, like many other organizations worldwide, has instructed employees to work from home. Safety of our people and security of our customer deliveries are TietoEVRY’s top priorities. However, when more than 90% of the task force is working from home, how does one ensure the security of customer deliveries, particularly when they are extremely critical and vital to our society.Amidst an international crisis, it is more important now than ever for us to help each other stay safe and secure!  Want to hear more?

Emerging edge computing – unlock the value of your data,/en/blog/2020/10/emerging-edge-computing/,Cloud / Jani Hyppönen / 12.10.2020,"First, what does edge computing mean in this context? One could say it is interaction between people, machines and business processes. Another way to define it is the placement of computing and intelligence as close as possible to digital touchpoints, whether that means intelligent production lines, autonomous vehicles or smart buildings. And all this is happening outside of cloud and traditional data centers.Data growth is a shared issue among all of these elements. IoT and 5G are driving more and more connected devices that generate more data, while the rise of AI increases the expectation to get more value from that ever-growing data. It is estimated that within the next few years, most enterprise data will be created and processed outside of data centers or clouds.But why? Partly because of the need for lower latency. Partly because of data growth exceeding the available bandwidth. Partly because of time-criticality and the need for greater autonomy, or simply security. Usually it is a combination of these factors.Potential for edge computing growing as fast as dataAcross the Nordics, we see many prime use cases emerging that are the driving the need for edge computing. In the industrial sector, predictive maintenance, precision farming, quality control assessment and fleet management are good examples. Tracking assets, predicting and preventing leaks or water quality are key use cases in the infrastructure and utilities sector. We see numerous other examples in logistics and across consumer services. And the potential applications are constantly growing.The maturity of these edge use cases also drives the need for new kinds of solutions and architectures with increasing autonomy at their edges, ultimately enabling fully autonomous and self-adapting systems. This presents challenges for CIOs, starting with figuring out how to deal with the ever-expanding myriad of technologies combined with new requirements for networks (latency and so on). Furthermore, data and analytics increasingly live outside of core enterprise applications and processes, which necessitates an end-to-end security approach, from connected devices all the way through to cloud services and back to the enterprise applications.We help our customers to design, build and run edge solutions all the way to IoT end-devices, with extensive data, cloud and analytics advisory and application services.

Cost control with Digital Oilfield Chemistry,/en/blog/2020/10/Cost-control-with-Digital-Oilfield-chemistry/,Digitalization / John-Arne  Stokkan / 9.10.2020,"Cost of operation is a highly discussed and recurring topic. In operational environments there is naturally a constant focus on reducing cost, where processes and procedures are thoroughly analyzed and optimized.Effective improvements comes from understanding the processes that impacts operations, and how the different processes and events relates with cascading impact throughout the production processes. Data is central in understanding these processes, and more important understanding how data relations describes different impact in different context.Oilfield production chemistryOilfield chemistry play a major role in both production regularity and operation integrity where chemical reactions caused by changes to system conditions and fluid chemistry often has severe impact the production and operation. When left unattended the result is cost going up and loss of revenue from e.g. production loss, reduced capacity and increased maintenance.Thus choosing the best strategy for managing operational and system risk is critical to control and reduce cost; i.e. strategy and decisions based on quality information from measured data.Strategic decisionsTreatment strategies are decided from system analysis and monitoring change. Cure as a solution; usually includes interventions, maintenance or chemical treatment, is associated with high cost and often a result of failed monitoring and prediction.On the other side a preventative treatment is founded on knowledge of the operational risk and the ability to adjust solutions accordingly such as material selection, operation changes or low dosage chemical treatments. In the long term being predictive and early capture changes to the operational risk keeps the cost low.A good treatment strategy need to be developed from a combination of system analysis, knowledge and monitoring. In addition it is important to understand how the operational risk changes in a changing production environment and how to keep up with agile treatment strategies.From data to decisionsIt becomes clear that in understanding operational risk there is need for a good data strategy. Knowing that information is not data it is equally important to understand the dependencies and relationship of indicators we are monitoring.Thus we know that oilfield chemistry risk is not single indicator describing each application but is a predictive combination giving a better picture that enables us to act and adjust instead of wait and cure.Automating, validating and improving data collection, processing and presentation should thus be considered the core of digital oilfield chemistry enabling informed and effective decisions and strategies.", John-Arne  Stokkan ,Digitalization , 9.10.2020
Sometimes existing DevOps practices aren’t enough,/en/blog/2020/10/sometimes-basic-devops-practices-arent-enough/,Digitalization / Björn Strömvall / 8.10.2020,"I recently worked with a large financial organization that had already adopted agile and selected DevOps working practices. Although this was a good start, it was not enough. The company needed to come up with further improvements to enhance the speed and efficiency of their development work.The company had several feature teams working on different locations. All of the teams had their own repositories and Continuous Integration pipelines for features, and also common ones that everybody shared. This setup did not deliver the results the company was expecting.My team and I were invited in to improve the situation. Let’s look at the two major findings and recommendations that we came up with in terms of pipeline harmonisation and quality management.Harmonising pipeline management without interfering ongoing developmentWe acknowledged that the various pipelines per feature area were only slightly different from each other. Hence, we proposed using a new common pipeline to achieve better control, traceability and automatic validation.We harmonised pipeline management and took a new common pipeline into use in parallel with the old pipelines. Transfer to the new pipeline was handled one repository at a time, which allowed us to replace old pipelines completely, step by step, without interfering the ongoing development work.Addressing fluctuating qualityThe fluctuating quality of the master branch was another major challenge. The company had feature teams that developed and validated their changes and merged the changes to the master. Frequently, these changes did not work as expected with the rest of the system.For the other teams, this meant that something which worked earlier suddenly did not work anymore. Hunting for the reasons and getting the faults corrected meant lost time and effort for everyone.We addressed the problem by focusing on certain core activities before merging code to the master. The new pipeline was equipped with three pre-merge gating controls to ensure code quality:Static code analysis with SonarQube: This guaranteed test coverage of the new code and prevented adding new code with faults.
Peer review of new code with Gerrit UI: At least two persons needed to be familiar with each update. This promoted working together and improved team responsibility. The practice was extended to also cover test cases and test automation code, which allowed a common way of working in the project according to the paradigm everything-as-code. Team members were encouraged to work iteratively with small incremental changes, making self-contained commits that can be more easily cherry-picked and reverted if needed. The visibility and traceability of code were improved before and after the merge.
Automated functions: For example, building code in build servers and always running unit tests after every build.A solid foundation for DevOps successPut together, these simple steps – harmonising pipeline management and addressing fluctuating quality with pre-merge gating controls – enabled creating a common pipeline without any disruption to the ongoing development work, and ensured that no obvious faults were present in the code and all changes were easily identified and traced. The result? A great foundation for faster and far more efficient development work.", Björn Strömvall ,Digitalization , 8.10.2020
Keep UX design top of mind when you move to SAP S/4 HANA,/en/blog/2020/10/keep-ux-design-top-of-mind-when-you-move-to-sap-s4-hana/,Digitalization / Jennifer  Ståhlberg / 30.9.2020,"I’ve helped many companies implement SAP S/4HANA and SAP Fiori. Usability thinking is something that we talk about a lot, but unfortunately its often discarded when projects are implemented. The primary reason for abandoning UX is money.Great UX includes all usersCertain basic principles of user-based design thinking date back several decades. The term Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) was made popular in the early '80s, and Jakob Nielsen wrote his famous 10 principles of usability inspection in the '90s. It is interesting how well these notions fit the design thinking of today. If we take a closer look at SAP Fiori, we can see most of these principles in action. Since this is the case, why do customers decide not to invest in good UX? Despite decades of usability theories, we still have to convince project owners that money spent on UX is money well spent.Companies implementing their SAP S/4HANA often fall into two typical categories in terms of UX design and Fiori implementation.Some ignore UX design from the very beginning of the project, which leads to poor ad hoc designs. 
Others are over-enthusiastic and insist on designing together with superusers. This may sound great, but it often leads to complex and heavy solutions.To make matters worse, both of these approaches cause delays in project schedules and cost more in the long run.The simple truth is that solutions are easier to adopt if they provide good User Experience for all user groups, including novices – and SAP is aware of this need for great UX for all.Superusers don’t make super UX designersAs designers typically have the users divided into three different groups (beginners, intermediates, and experts), we can see that SAP ERP has traditionally targeted expert users with its’ GUI. Since each transaction holds tasks for a variety of roles and steps, this can quickly make the interface so complex that using it requires hours of training, repetition, and handling user errors.It’s not the best idea to involve superusers in the design phase of a project. It easily leads to a lack of simplicity: design thinking and usability take a much smaller role than they should because superusers already have the necessary semantic and syntactic skills to operate complex systems. Short inputs, clear messages from the system, and a limited amount of choices benefit everyone, including the novice users. This is where SAP Fiori is just the ticket.A traditional GUI-transaction with multiple buttons and small icons can be quite intimidating for a new user. SAP Fiori follows a “less is more” approach with its 1-1-3 way of thinking. In it, each screen is designed for one user role, a single task, and a maximum of three levels of navigation to perform the task. Users are shown only the relevant information they need, which reduces their memory load and gives a more appealing look that is easier to adapt. Fiori even gives the user the option of inserting personal default parameters (for example Company Code) to reduce repetitive tasks in their everyday work.SAP Fiori is incredibly adaptiveObviously, there are no universal solutions that fit all industries like a glove. This is something that SAP has acknowledged from early on. Its solutions have been modifiable and configurable, and with Fiori, this has been honed to the point that there really isn’t anything that you are doing with SAP ERP which you couldn’t do with Fiori. On the contrary, with Fiori, you can do more.Fiori is incredibly adaptive. You can use it with pretty much any device, have any 3rd party integrations, and use whatever module or business area you want. From Fiori 3.0 on S/4HANA introduces the user to machine learning, conversational AI, and proactive business situation handling. Making business decisions from these insights just doesn’t get any better.So, let’s talk about moneyWhen it comes to new system implementation, most customers want to see the actual benefits and savings on paper. SAP Fiori delivers various human and monetary benefits, including an increase in productivity (less clicking around and fewer mistakes) and data quality. The simple design saves training costs, decreases user errors, and even cuts change requests. It also provides user satisfaction, customer loyalty, and a strong IT/business relationship.If you ask end-users for their opinion, they often state that the old way of doing things is all the UX they need. This is hardly surprising, as new ways of doing things means stepping out of their comfort zones – and although we all know that change is inevitable, it feels scary to many of us.No amount of convincing will erase all change resistance. In my mind, the key question is when will we make the change, not will we change. Making the change sooner will increase your overall efficiency faster.In order to be attractive even for the novice user, the application should be delightful, simple, coherent, adaptive, and role-based. Investing in these things in the beginning of a project will end up saving you money in the long run. Tasks will be executed faster; there will be less errors, and huge change requests will not be needed.There are great possibilities for delivering smooth user experiences in SAP. However, I urge anyone planning their SAP S/4HANA transformation to invest some extra thinking to create a solution that matches the needs of all their end-users. The right time to initiate this is in the design phase of the project.You might also be interested in reading ""Creating the ideal roadmap for SAP S/4HANA"".", Jennifer  Ståhlberg ,Digitalization , 30.9.2020
Production management improves quality and productivity – but how do we achieve large-scale benefits in health and social care?,/en/blog/2020/09/production-management-improves-quality-and-productivity--but-how-do-we-achieve-large-scale-benefits-in-health-and-social-care/,Digitalization / Tommi Koistinen / 30.9.2020,"There is need for understanding social and healthcare processes, customer and patient information systems, and system-independent production management as well as analytics solutions. The parallel development of this entity enables impressive cost-effective services and processes that are managed with operational information.Start with developing all operationsA prerequisite for optimizing the operations of the entire organization is that the sub-processes support the goals of the overall desired benefit. When aiming to optimize an individual sub-process, for example, a business unit, this may not support the development of other business units or the organization as whole.Thus, it is worth starting the change of operations from the big picture perspective with a clear definition of the overall benefits that would ideally be achieved for the selected service entity.Better service experienceProduction management results in smooth and cost-effective service and maintenance paths that cross service and sector boundaries and better meet customers’ service needs. The customer’s transition between the different stages of the service path are seamless, and the utilization of service providers’ resources is optimized.Production management also ensures that the necessary measures have been taken in every stage of the service path, and advance information is passed on to the next stages. The smooth progress of the service path between different actors enables a better service experience for the customer.Control costsThe system-independent production management solution facilitates the planning of service production in different time spans according to the service needs and requirements of the operating environment. Improvements to the service production productivity can be achieved by optimizing resource utilization rates and ensuring the efficient use of the most critical resources, such as operating theatres.It is also possible to react faster to changes in the planned service paths, also informing various actors about the changes is smoother. In this way, the share of different actors can be optimized so that service production runs as efficiently as possible.Comprehensive management of health and social care servicesIn the future, service paths will be increasingly managed across sectoral boundaries, which emphasizes the importance of production management as a system-independent solution that combines operations and information. It is important to understand the specifics of different sectors. Hence the processes that guide operations and the information that flows through the interfaces of information systems can be harmonized and developed to serve the whole.Good starting point for joint developmentThe time to develop production management is now. TietoEVRY’s extensive experience in both customer and patient information systems, and the special features of social and health provides an excellent starting point. Now we want to further develop the social and healthcare production management solution collaboratively with other players in the game.Customer and patient information systems produce increasingly structural information about the different stages and progress of care and services. This facilitates the development and utilization of new types of production management solutions.The best result is achieved through open and close joint development, based on the requirements of social and health care operations and smooth usability. Continuous dialogue coupled with the agility of modern software development ensures that the solution provided meets the exact challenge that have been identified through production management. This could be the optimal utilization of common resources. Want to discuss further?Read more about our healthcare and welfare solutions and services", Tommi Koistinen ,Digitalization , 30.9.2020

We organize interesting activities such as workshops, spare time activities, networking meetups with young professionals from other companies and trips regularly in the Nordics and other countries. As part of the network, you get to meet inspiring colleagues across units and countries, share knowledge and make new friends – let’s not forget the afterworks and fun!Traditional assembliesEvery year, a bunch of TietoEVRY Young Professionals from different countries gather for a traditional assembly trip - last year our assembly trip took place in London over a long weekend full of networking, workshopping and fun.  The trip was culminated with a workshop facilitated by Google, in this way we got to strengthen our connection and collaboration with our partner and share and spar with each other.The workshop was kicked off with a Kahoot competition being continued with an introduction to Google Cloud products and the company culture. As part of the group assignment we had a chance to put our pitching skills to a test, the best pitch winning goodies related to Google Cloud, of course. We practiced team working skills but also defining ideas. Pitching skills are useful regardless of the job title; whether you are selling a product or have an idea you want to get across.As an after work(shop) activity, we were treated with a distillery tour in one of London's vodka distilleries. While sipping some tasty local produce, the distillery tour revealed the fine art of making vodka and gin as well as explaining the business around it. The day was completed with our personalized, TietoEVRY-labelled double-decker ride along the Thames and a cozy dinner as the final flourish.The weekend got us all in a fantastic mood, not only when in London, but also in the offices afterward. We met a lot of new people, connected socially with colleagues, made new friends and learned new things. Feeling of connectedness fueled us with great energy - after all we are, one TietoEVRY.Read more about our Graduate Program", Krista Karttunen  ,Meet our people , 29.9.2020
A place where future talents can challenge themselves,/en/blog/2020/09/a-place-where-future-talents-can-safely-challenge-themselves/,Meet our people / Sonja & Iiris         / 28.9.2020,"This is how Sonja and Iiris, summer 2020 Business Development Trainees, sum up their three months at TietoEVRY. Let them tell you why.True action from the start!Sometimes you hear stories about summer trainees doing stuff no one else wants to do. But not here. As our first assignments, we both made market approaches – Sonja for Financial Services and Iiris for Manufacturing. After these separate projects, we became peers.Together, we created a toolkit for the local partnerships in Finland and formed a Post-COVID19 industry view for the Finnish market. We also finalized a follow-up analysis on workhour reservations to improve our billability and reservation levels to reach full efficiency. Iiris even took over the Instagram Stories and participated in the culture hackathon. And we both got the chance to share our summer experiences through this blog post, which was thrilling!Our work was guided and evaluated according to the same criteria as everyone else’s. This made us try even harder and, eventually, we were truly proud of what we had achieved. We had the possibility to utilize all our experience and business insight gained from our studies.We are still amazed of how much can happen in just three months.Culture of helpingThe support from our wonderful managers and colleagues was a key factor that helped us to manage as well as we did. Having a trainee partner was also valuable – someone to brainstorm and share your feelings with on a daily basis gave us both strengths to push forward, towards more and more demanding tasks. It also brought a lot of joy to our days.What surprised us a bit was that the feeling of togetherness and collaboration did not suffer even when COVID-19 had us working mainly remotely. It was always easy to find help and to get to know people. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. In fact, the “new normal” turned out to work well, as it offered a great flexibility to decide, for example, where we wanted to work or when to start the day. Despite this unusual time, we also managed to hang out together outside of work, in various smaller events.Learning as a lifestyleFrom day one, it was obvious to us that here learning is a lifestyle.Most of the projects and daily work required continuous learning. Not just from us, but from everyone. Of course, we as trainees had the highest learning curve on the IT industry, the solutions TietoEVRY provides and, for example, on how to utilize Excel in data analysis. It was also fruitful to learn how to present our own insights in a professional way to experienced audiences.So, if we say that our summer was insightful and diverse, and that the experience was superb, we truly mean that. We would absolutely recommend working as a trainee at TietoEVRY to anyone who wants to challenge themselves and has an interest in digital solutions.We even feel a bit sad to leave as studies continue! But who knows, maybe we’ll be back here one day!Check out and apply for our Summer Trainee positions 2021!Follow us on Instagram and get a taste of #TietoEVRY life!", Sonja & Iiris         ,Meet our people , 28.9.2020
Helping customers with their cloud journey and shaping the future of everyday life,/en/blog/2020/09/helping-customers-with-their-cloud-journey/,Meet our people / Tommy Persson / 28.9.2020,"I help customers with their journey to the cloud and also to get the best out of their investment in Public Cloud. I work with all major Public Cloud platforms like AWS, GCP and Azure.Are you interested in working with cloud and as a bonus want to become colleagues with me? We’re looking for cloud advisors & architects to join our team helping our customers with the transformation. Apply now!The next phase of cloud development?I think the next phase from a business perspective is that many of our customers, old and new, are getting more cloud mature and are beginning to see cloud as an enabler for their own business growth. In the old on-premise landscape, IT was often seen as just a cost with slow processes. Now we have the new innovative digital start-up companies leading the way as they have built their business around new business models and they have more agile ways of working from start. This means our customers need to have faster development of new services and features. So, there are interesting things happening around the cloud business all the time that challenges us to stay on top of the area with our capabilities and our services.On the technology side there are many new services and features coming all the time from all cloud vendors. Interestingly, we see a lot around security, management and automation to further increase the capabilities in the cloud. One thing I am looking into now is Confidential Computing. This enables business that had privacy concerns and challenging compliance requirements to move their workloads to the cloud.Shaping the future of everyday lifeThere are many new exiting things in TietoEVRY. The merge of two companies where we now are building a new company culture is one thing. Another one is that we have so many skilled people in so many areas and we are working with many different customers from many different industries. We are a big company and we are dealing with companies and organization that deliver many of the things we use in our ordinary daily life, like services from retails, banking and insurance, mills, energy companies, the whole public sector and so on. That is really impressive to be part of.Different roles & and diverse teamsI have been in the company for quite a long time now and that is because there have been so many different opportunities during the years. So instead of changing company I have had the opportunity to change roles and develop myself in that sense. I would say I’ve had a constant career development during the years.I started my carrier in the IT industry in in the early -90’s with technical consulting, managing infrastructure, worked with software development and systems administration. So, when I joined TietoEVRY (at that time TietoEnator) in 2004 I had a deep technical background and had been working with some different companies.In TietoEVRY I was mentored into leadership roles and had the opportunity to work with and lead some of the greatest and most skilled people we have in the area and we delivered best in class IT-services to customers in the public sector for many years from this team. My career then evolved towards more sales related roles, working with large sourcing bids and acting as customer responsible for some customers. In this work it became natural to follow the development in the market and the cloud business as both our partners and our customers started to talk about that. As I still had my technical interest, I took a deep technical dive into the different platforms. And that lead to now being a certified Cloud Architect in multiple cloud platforms, working as a Public Cloud consultant and continuing to learn new things every day.I am really proud of my colleagues and the collaboration we have. I work with teammates and colleagues that are spread over different cities and countries, and we still have the best possible collaboration and daily contact, both through chat and through video meetings. My team(s) also consists of people with many different backgrounds, ages, genders and they are very passionate about what they work with and there is always knowledge sharing between everyone.", Tommy Persson ,Meet our people , 28.9.2020

"We cried wolf, and the wolf came! What do you want to do now that Amazon is here?",/en/blog/2020/09/what-to-do-now-when-amazon-is-here/,Digitalization / Jonas Prosell / 22.9.2020,"We cried wolf and as you know, it has now been confirmed, the wolf will arrive in Sweden and the Nordics. According to a press release from Amazon on August 4, a warehouse will open in Eskilstuna and a Swedish site will be launched.Why is there no way of getting around Amazon? Well, it really goes without saying, but please bear with us. When Amazon entered the German and British markets, they quickly captured a very large share of the consumer markets. In Germany,  protests regarding conditions for workers have caused some controversy over the years, but the fact is that more than a quarter of e-commerce sales in Germany are generated through Amazon.1 In the UK,  Amazon has about a third of the market.Wolf or albatross?But is Amazon really a wolf? Or is Amazon an albatross that spreads its wings and lets you as a retailer fly out into the world reaching new markets and customers? Could Amazon be an opportunity? To be or not to be, on Amazon, that is the question!Amazon's impact among consumers in the United States is so powerful that more than half of all product searches start here. Therefore, Amazon is challenging not only brands, pure players, and traditional retail chains, but also mighty Google3. One can conclude that Amazon is not just a store in the perception of consumer’s, rather the marketplace represents a gigantic supply of products regardless of category. If you want to drive sales through products, this is an extremely important aspect to consider.If we zoom in further on the US market and look at consumers who shopped through Amazon at some point in the last two years, the figure will be even higher; about two-thirds of all consumers start their search on Amazon and only 20% in a search engine.4 As few as 4% of Amazon customers went directly to the brand's own store,  and only 3% to another marketplace.5The PRIME membership that includes ""free shipping"" and a packaged offering, that among other things includes streaming services is nothing but a success. The Amazon logistics network has challenged the shipping industry with speed and price pressure. PRIME reaches all walks of life, and it is fair to note that more than 70% of all Americans with an annual income of over $150,000 are members of PRIME.Another aspect worth considering is the huge volume of third-party sellers that account for a larger share of sales than direct sales on Amazon. If a product becomes popular with consumers, third-party sellers will list the product on Amazon. The seller's choice of images, headers and product descriptions will represent your brand regardless of the quality of the product presentation. Consequently, your product will be found through a search on Amazon.Pros and consWhat do we make of all this? A reasonable conclusion is that brands need to take control of how their content is presented on Amazon. So which stance have brands around the world taken towards Amazon? A fair share has chosen to list its product offering on the marketplace. Amazon also offers registered brands the opportunity to set up their own store, providing greater control over the experience. Of course, there are brands that refuse to appear on Amazon, many of them luxurious brands such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton. 6 One reason is that they want to preserve the feeling of exclusivity that may be lost if the product is sold alongside cleaning products for bathrooms. Classic marketing knowledge teaches us that scarcity creates desire.If you do not already have a successful international establishment, Amazon could represent a shortcut. In addition to reaching a larger audience, you can use Amazon's infrastructure and processes to reach international markets.No matter what others may think about Amazon, you need to make up your own mind whether your products and services should be on Amazon's platform. They are here in the Nordics and cannot be ignored. Consider the pros- and cons and make your own analysis.Is it possible to control your own destiny and retain control of the user experience when selling through Amazon?  We are happy to help you deal with such issues, or if need support in your strategies. My colleagues and I are here for you.

Who benefits the most from Request-to-Pay?,/en/blog/2020/09/who-benefits-the-most-from-request-to-pay/,Data / Sami  Uski / 22.9.2020,"How does Request to Pay work?With Request to Pay (RtP), businesses or individuals can send an electronic request for payment to a debtor account. In contrast to direct debits, RtPs work in real-time and are suitable for single or ad hoc payments. Payment requests can be sent to, and forwarded on, by the payer through multiple channels.Unlocking new revenue streamsAs a consumer, the way you apply for a mortgage, check out on an online store or pay a utility bill via an internet bank have completely different steps. But what if these payment processes could be simplified and completed in one click? RtP enables a four-corner model, where a bank can contact a client or payer via their preferred banking app, be it for a P2P payment, e-payment, utility bill, whether they’re at home or abroad. The consumer can then choose what to do with the payment: check-and-approve, decline, set a date for the payment to selected creditors or automate payments for a certain date.If several payment flows follow the same process, the bank (or the one offering the consumer the wallet) has gained a central place to offer additional payment services to create new value and provide an even better consumer experience. Banks can also retain old and attract new customers as well as adding even more services that generate new revenue streams. Let’s explore what these services could be.Boosting consumer experienceAn offer of credit is an obvious new service. Rather than using a credit card to make a purchase, what if there are more options? For example, non-card revolving credit or pre-scored loans offered at the point of purchase. The wallet “knows” the payments are due and could offer the customer the option to use the credit now or sign up for instalments to secure the balance for other upcoming payments.Or perhaps the customer could even receive an insurance offer for the product they are buying. For example, a customer books a flight with an airline company that ceases to exist at the time the flight was due to take off. Normally, this would be a shame and perhaps the customer would lose their money, but luckily the bank offered payment insurance for the flight tickets at the time of booking, and even travel insurance as well.How could a Bank transform these ideas into live services? They would need a network of business partners, an ecosystem to respond to the needs of consumers. Taking the previous idea as an example, the bank would need a partnership with an Insurance company. Luckily, Open Banking and API’s can solve this technological element of collaboration.Business benefits tooFor consumers and banks the benefits of RtP are now clear, but what does it offer for businesses such as merchants and utility companies?  This landscape is fragmented and diverse, comprised of large merchant chains, international corporations as well as small local businesses. Many of these companies still use old ERP systems and services that are not well suited for real-time payment schemes such as RtP.However, we can see some real ecommerce trailblazers with merchants already leveraging the benefits of RtP such as secure messaging between the consumer and the merchant and giving consumers more control and flexibility with making payments. Or in the Nordics for example, we see a rapid move from card to instant payments which comes down to a better user experience and leads to improved conversion rates. And because RtP operates in real-time, merchants also benefit from the immediacy of funds.How to make the change?Still, for the majority of companies lots of changes are needed to harness the benefits of real-time payments. It requires a change in financial processes - a move of liquidity management and daily treasury operations to a real-time 24/7 operation. And it requires new investment to maintain 24/7 real-time payment flows. However, the business benefit could be substantial and automated rule-setting in treasury systems such as VAM (Virtual Account Management) will potentially solve many issues.Are you ready for RtP?To summarize, RtP enables real-time payment data flows that create an enhanced customer experience both for businesses and consumers. Due to the unprecedented times we are living in, further digitalization and immediate access to funds has gained even more significance. Therefore RtP is probably poised for mass adoption.", Sami  Uski ,Data , 22.9.2020
Hybrid Cloud benefits – how to unleash them?,/en/blog/2020/09/hybrid-cloud-benefits/,Cloud / Francisco Romero Gotor  / 18.9.2020,"Hybrid cloud can enable a full cloud experience (and full cloud benefits) by seamlessly choreographing the different platforms – with less churn, more scalability, better data deployment and improved business speed and flexibility. But how can you ensure this value-creating harmony and integration come together? This is challenging, but not impossible.Can’t go all-in on public cloud? Go hybridIn cloud everything just scales with need. But for many organizations, becoming “fully hyper-scalers” is not yet realistic, for natural reasons. Organizational approaches to compliance or data protection and limitations of IT structures, e.g. in terms of latency, are just a few hurdles. In these scenarios, hybrid cloud is the right fit.Done right, hybrid cloud can fully enable true cloud benefits in a way that integrates organizations’ current systems/platforms into cloud counterparts, allowing workloads to shift seamlessly between private and public clouds – giving businesses greater flexibility, scalability and speed, with more data deployment options. This also enables cost effectiveness and cost forecasting, as detailed in our new white paper.Full benefits of hybrid cloud IaaSInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing infrastructure and service where organizations lease needed servers and cloud computing power from a service provider. It brings flexibility, scalability and efficiency to operations with various cost savings possible to achieve.With hybrid cloud IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), organizations can fulfil various business needs. IaaS offers flexibility and scalability for businesses to meet the changes in demand and operating environment. IaaS can also be used to manage infrastructure-as-code to optimise IT environment costs. And IaaS avoids quality issues by applying software management quality practices to infrastructure environments. IaaS also puts businesses in full control of their security implementation with automated controls.Consider industrial cases where part of a system needs to be close to manufacturing sites, where applications need office locations and big data lakes for analytics in public clouds to leverage ready tools. Without hybrid cloud, this complexity is virtually impossible to manage competitively.Cloud connects developers with a very rich environment filled with ready-made solutions that you simply cannot ignore if you want to be competitive today. These resources facilitate development of optimized applications, in terms of both cost and lead-time to implementation, while providing endless flexibility for growth. Traditionally, these features were available only via public cloud IaaS, but hybrid cloud enabled solutions now offer these benefits through privately hosted elements within hybrid contexts.Hybrid Cloud offers flexible implementations with full cloud experienceAs with any cloud transformation, adopting hybrid cloud starts with defining your organization’s situation, targets and challenges. Hybrid cloud cannot empower your cloud transformation without a solid business case. Business needs, not technology, should always drive solution selection – so define your needs before selecting a technological solution.Then comes the implementation and introduction phases. This is when organizations need to leverage partners more in order to deploy the benefits to their teams sustainably and with speed. Hybrid solutions are intrinsically more complicated and require wider skill sets to harness their potential. That means a ‘do-it-yourself’ approach can simply kill your business case for going to cloud both in terms of costs and lead time to reaping benefits. Organizations committed to this journey should choose a partner that has resolved the technical challenges, has made them easy to overcome and can reliably deliver at scale. The dream of “pressing the button and deploying” is not far from the truth when the previous phases have been thorough.Make no mistake, true cloud benefits can be achieved with the hybrid cloud approach – meaning accelerating innovation and go-to-market processes while safeguarding business continuity. Hybrid cloud enables this with automated and secure cloud services that provide resiliency and reliability as well as agility and productivity – and you can achieve over 30% TCO savings compared to traditional infrastructure services. Not to mention indirect effects like increased productivity and reduced technical debt from IT infrastructure. And because hybrid cloud solutions are built on top of current IT systems, a total infrastructure revamp is unnecessary.Today, when elasticity and scalability are not luxuries but critical business assets, every organization should ask a vital question: why not reap the benefits?

Dare to Share,/en/blog/2020/09/dare-to-share/,Data / Dmitry Shipilov / 17.9.2020,"One of the major trends in virtually any industry nowadays is the changing role of data. As the world moves towards a digital economy and digital ecosystems, and even more from physical to digital interaction in general, data stops being a unique asset.From being the “modern gold or oil”, or whatever else they like to call it, in many respects data starts to resemble a commodity – or even a publicly owned utility. Our topic today is how the role of data changes, what challenges this transformation brings and how to deal with it.Download our whitepaper on this topic, Dare to Share: When data sharing and exchange make strategic sense, or continue reading.The driving forces of the digital economyWhile still being a huge asset and competitive barrier in isolation, data much more often becomes a vehicle for strategic breakthrough, but only when shared between multiple parties to create a mutual business advantage.There are multiple structural forces at play here. You have customers who want to be in control of their data, regulators that make it more difficult to keep data ownership and digital services that start making much more sense or deliver much more value when they are cross-organizational or even cross-industry. Finally, the way data is generated has changed. There is much more data generated out of your direct reach or control than within it. As a result, there is much more you can do in partnerships than alone. So, in these circumstances, cross-organizational data sharing and exchange, as well as open data partnerships, become the driving force of a new economy.The sources of strategic advantageEach company should understand whether data sharing and exchange is a thing for them. They need to understand what strategic advantage it offers and how to exploit it in the right wayOne example when data sharing and exchange makes strategic sense is when vertical integration is impossible (for example, due to regulation), inappropriate (due to market diversity), or simply expensive. In this case, building a digital ecosystem can be an alternative that removes obstacles; but one cannot build a digital ecosystem without shared data. One case in point is TradeLens, a global platform and interconnected ecosystem of supply chain partners developed by Maersk and IBM. You cannot and do not want to acquire or merge with counterparties in a logistic chain, so you onboard them on a platform driven by shared data.Another example is the possibility to offer integrated add-on and bundled services that bring much more value when they are cross-business. Bundled road assistance and maintenance services in the field of motor insurance is one obvious example, but if you look carefully at your own industry through the lens of sharing data you can find opportunities previously untouched.Data sharing also makes sense when auxiliary data from complementary sources is combined to offer better insights into a business or market. Here, we are able to talk about machine learning algorithms that can be trained much better if they are fed as much information as possible, including data from partners. Interestingly, research shows that certain industries can even benefit if competitors share their data with each other (which can sound counterintuitive at first). Insurance is an example of such an industry.Finally, data sharing can be a cost optimization strategy – and there are different ways to achieve it, both operationally and legally. Take, for example, Invidem, a Nordic KYC Utility that was founded not so long ago. It’s a clear example of process externalization that has several strategic benefits, and is based on data sharing and exchange as a principle.This is not the endYou are most welcome to download our whitepaper, Dare to Share: When data sharing and exchange make strategic sense, where you can find solid insights and thinking around the matter. In this paper, we explore when data sharing and exchange make the most sense. Then, we look at the criteria that help you determine if you are in a good position to make it part of your business. Finally, we explore the requirements that your technology needs to meet in order to share and exchange data with external parties, both securely and efficiently.Last but not least, we present you with an exciting selection of 8 success stories and solutions that TietoEVRY had the honour of working on in the context of sharing and exchanging data among businesses and institutions. Among them are two great sustainability stories, where TietoEVRY helped the Nordic cities of Vaasa and Trondheim become more carbon-friendly by sharing data between local businesses in one case and energy utilities in the other.In one case within healthcare and welfare TietoEVRY helped to build preventive healthcare and medical research ecosystem for University Hospital in Helsinki.

DevOps on scale in multilocation teams – a story worth sharing,/en/blog/2020/09/devops-on-scale-in-distributed-teams--a-story-worth-sharing/,Cloud / Markus Mikkolainen / 15.9.2020,"Once upon a time there was a development team. The team members were frustrated with inefficiencies, because they had high hopes: they wanted to become the most efficient team in the world. To achieve their aspirations, they rolled up their sleeves and got to work. They defined the responsibilities of each team member, developed a way to communicate closely, and even removed physical barriers in their workspace and drank coffee around the same table at the same time. They learned to know each other very well, learned to trust each other and became very efficient in their work, delivering great results for the business. Everybody was happy (for a while).But as the system and development ecosystem grew, also development teams became more distributed and it impacted teams’ collaboration. Developers could no longer interact in the same physical space. Teams with members from different locations needed to focus even more on communication. Ensuring that business and customer knowledge existed in all teams was crucial. Everyone needed to understand what they were contributing to the big picture.If the frontend works, so does the backendThe teams learned that it was highly important to define the frontend and user experience (UX) on a very detailed level, in close interaction with the customer. Business analyst and UX designer roles were critical, really breaking down different parts into high quality stories for developers, all the way to the acceptance criteria. When developers understood the big picture, they were then free to choose how to deliver it.Defining front-end in a detailed way with UI prototypes helped to avoid and catch possible faults in the earlier phases.By now every member of every team appreciated that if the front-end works as planned, most often so does the backend too.Facing different maturity levels between teams in a multivendor environmentOur story doesn’t end here, for the system grew even more, as it gained more connections to other systems provided by other vendors. Instead of one vendor, there were soon ten vendors and multiple teams serving the business. This uncovered challenges in communication and testing between teams.We now faced a key challenge in scaling DevOps: realizing different maturity levels between teams. As there are always dependencies between different parallel development tracks, teams are dependent on getting test environments and test data from each other. Some projects needed to wait for their test environments for months, while some got theirs within a day. Especially legacy systems and integrations were problematic.The teams learned that capabilities in all teams need to be on a level that allows deployments in the same rhythm. They grasped that advanced automation enabled committing to 30-40 deployments per week – whereas without automation, the pace would be as little as one release per quarter.Lessons we learnedThe DevOps transformation journey that I took with our customer really drove home that the key to success in scaling DevOps lies in lifting process maturity, development environments, and automation capabilities to the same level in all teams. There is no single magic trick that makes this happen, but there are certainly valuable lessons that are worth taking into consideration:Invest in skilled Scrum masters / Release train engineers / Site reliability engineers – and ensure good interaction between them to ease communication between teams. 
Keep your lead architects close to the business to ensure business understanding. 
Investigate and develop operational processes throughout the entire house. 
Focus on test and deployment automation to speed up processes. A shared system team could support all teams to use automation correctly and maintain it. 
Culture is the key: everyone must feel responsibility not to break or interfere with other’s builds and see the value of common processes and KPIs.Consider setting up a feature team including developers with mandates to make changes. This improves cross-team communication.  
Identify what are the key performance indicators to follow and on what level, e.g. top 10 Fisma recommendations.As the story above shows, DevOps is not about techniques – it is about culture combined with technical capabilities. Change is possible and reachable, but it does not happen easily. In addition to being a cultural change, DevOps is a strategic choice that requires a strong, continuous business commitment.", Markus Mikkolainen ,Cloud , 15.9.2020

We live in a world where, regardless of human rights, people cannot express themselves fully in work life or elsewhere in society. Lhbtiq+ people and minorities, people with rainbow identities, people from various social and ethnic backgrounds and belief and religious systems face discrimination, and even threats, every day. This cannot stand.At TietoEVRY, we are proud advocates and upholders of equality. Inclusion and diversity are at the core of our values. And we have zero tolerance for unethical behavior or discrimination in any form. Employee rights and physical and emotional safety in the workplace are essential to us – everyone should feel safe, welcome and respected at work just as they are. For us, an inclusive environment is where everyone is treated with equal respect and dignity to develop oneself and one's career.We currently serve customers in 90 countries, and we strongly believe that diversity brings us competitive advantage. When we have a diverse working community, we also have the ability to create solutions that serve all aspects of society. Diversity and inclusion are fundamental in driving innovation forward and they also nurture creativity and problem-solving abilities. When a team has various backgrounds, viewpoints and experiences, people are more inclined to present more creative opinions, counterarguments and solutions compared to tightly homogeneous teams.This year, the theme of Helsinki Pride is role models. People who have inspired us and who have helped us feel that we are not alone. A role model can be a brave leader who has shown example and paved the way for others. But it can be an organization as well. At TietoEVRY, we wish to be a community where our values are lived through every day, where our people feel safe and can thrive being who they are. We as a company strive for improvements every day.I believe in leading through example. An important tool for building an inclusive culture is to increase awareness and understanding within managers. Many discriminatory structures result from unconscious bias and thought patterns we might not be aware of. Last year, we initiated a bias training for people in decision-making positions, and already over 650 of our managers have taken bias training by now. Read more of our practices in fostering diversity and inclusion here.Our team at Helsinki Pride parade 2019.Diversity frees us to think without limits. However, diversity without inclusion would be like a boat without a sail. For us, inclusion means taking everyone on board, and hearing and respecting various viewpoints. Expelling hate speech is an important part of making this a reality. Our latest social initiative is Polite Type, an open source font against hate speech and online bullying.

How to take your remote office to the next level,/en/blog/2020/09/how-to-take-your-remote-office-to-the-next-level/,Meet our people / Karl Forsman / 8.9.2020,"Part time vacation – part time workBefore summer Karl was asked if he could assist his colleagues in India with some deliveries this summer. Consequently, he thought it would be a good idea to test if it is possible to combine work and vacation.""Since we had already worked from home all spring, I thought I would test if it could be a good idea to work part-time and take some part-time vacation during a set period this summer. I love to drive my motorbike, so I sat down and made a route I would follow, where I could drive from place to place during my vacation days and find amazing places to work from. It made it feel like I was still on vacation while working.""Karl tested this new way of working for a couple of weeks and he really loved it. He got the opportunity to find places to work from such as in front of an idyllic lake or a small garden full of flowers. He also felt like he really was on vacation, even though he could not travel abroad.""When travelling around for a long time, there will always be some setback, such as some unplanned repairs and bad weather that ruined my camping plans, but as long as you are prepared for unplanned setback you are good. As for working conditions, they have been good. The biggest problems I have encountered are the situations where the Wi-Fi connection has been swaying without warning. Otherwise, it has worked well.""Freedom and easy change of environmentThe most positive thing about his experiment must be the feeling of freedom and possibility to change the environment and working position easy. In that way, he also got a naturally healthy movement throughout his working day.Another thing Karl experienced was that he did well by planning where he would set up the workplace for the day. And he always had a couple of extra options, if needed. For example, if he arrived at a location he wanted to work from and the Wi-Fi was bad, he could easily drive to option number two. To get the best environment for working Karl also tried to set up his computer in a similar way to how he does when sitting in the regular office.""I did my best to set up the computer slightly raised and use a keyboard and a mouse. Another thing is that you want to be able to shut out the outside world as best as you can. So good headphones and a good mic for Teams meetings are essential.""Karl is highly positive about companies letting employees work more remotely, and he thinks that this is one of the positive effects of Covid-19. Companies have seen that employees who have the possibility to work more remotely feel they have more trust from the company, they are saving travel time in the mornings and afternoons and are working more efficiently.""Accepting remote work makes the employees so much more flexible. Especially for me who has no direct colleague in my office. By that, I mean no one in the same role at my department. The possibility of remote work gives me the opportunity to travel to visit colleagues in the same role, but also to work from places that give me my ideal work environment. For some people that might be in a big office, but for those who concentrate better alone, it will give them more motivation to know that they can work remotely some days a week.""A new experimentAll in all, Karl’s experiment has been successful, and when we asked him if he would do the same next summer he answered with a smile:""I’m eager to take this a step further. I’m not quite sure how I will do that yet, but if you want to know, hang on and I will definitely let you know when I have the answer.""Karl’s working from the road tips:Be prepared for the unplanned and unexpected, travel with an open and solution-oriented mind.
Make a concrete plan for places where you want to work and also want to see
Always have a plan B on where to work, in case unplanned situations come up, like bad Wi-Fi.

Monolith to microservices architecture – six key benefits,/en/blog/2020/09/monolith-to-microservices-architecture--six-key-benefits/,Digitalization / Farrah Farooq / 7.9.2020,"IT industry excites me because of the many interesting career paths and for playing a key role in driving global innovation forward. Within this field, I get a chance to team-up with passionate people worldwide.The most exciting challenge for me now, is to build next generation digital solutions for our customers, employees, and citizens. At TietoEVRY we aim to provide elevated customer experience, therefore we are adapting very quickly to exciting new technologies in cloud computing, APIOps, DevOps, DevSecOps.As a cloud specialist, my role is to develop high quality and secure cloud-based solutions, where we implement test-driven and event-driven microservices. I would like to give our customers a competitive edge by using latest automation techniques in Azure DevOps. I have been doing coding since year 2001 started with the C-language in back old college days. I love what I do because it is an area full of opportunities having enormous industry growth and most importantly work-life balance. What can I say, simple, clear, bullet proof-code and elegant solutions are my cup of tea!I am very passionate about my work, so let’s talk some microservices!Over the last decade, solution architectures have greatly evolved, from model-view-controller MVC architecture to microservices architecture. In MVC, the segregation of development is done strictly in three areas and the application is monolith before being deployed as a single, executable package.Microservices is not merely an architecture, it is a mindset built within continuously deployed systems in cloud. It is basically a network of small APIs with HTTP REST protocol interface. We can also call them apps or functionality that are developed, executed, tested, versioned and deployed independently. This has six main advantages over traditional architectures:(1) Increased scalability: Nowadays, due to the cross-platform approach and elasticity provided by the containerization of apps, horizontal scaling done via microservices is high performant and cost efficient. If one feature requires more resources in terms of data or users, e.g. application pool size or memory for storing worker threads, then the whole app has to be scaled. If that feature is a microservice itself, then we can allocate resources only to that particular app, hence increased performance, optimized resources and lower costs.(2) Continuous deployment: Usually during agile development, a team consists of developers that may develop or support several different business core features concurrently. If everyone is doing this in the same app, for example in a single visual studio or node.js project under the same GitHub repository with a single CI/CD release pipeline, there is an increased risk of (1) merge conflicts, (2) dependency issues by stepping on other’s toes and (3) when redeploy changes in one feature, to get an immediate effect the whole project needs redeployment, which increases waiting time for other developers. In microservices architecture, each team can build and deploy services as totally separate apps, without affecting or disrupting other teams. This, in turn, makes conflict resolution simple.(3) Easy integration with third parties: Developers may need to store and retrieve data from third party customer databases, e.g. on-premises SAP servers or cloud servers. In this case, building an independent API for integration and transformation service can increase code-reusability and security constraints. This API may also store integration mapping in the data stores which is used more than once.(4) Failure resistant: In general, there is no service that is 100% failure resistant. However, microservices handle failures elegantly. That means your system is reliable and a single failure to your service doesn’t lead to the entire system shutting down. Other services (replicas) will take over just-in-time, but only if they are provided with monitoring systems, e.g. Azure monitoring.(5) Evolutionary: A migration is possible from monolith into microservices in an evolutionary fashion. First, you need to start with one or two APIs and connect to the old system via those APIs, before adding more components as new requirements come along. This architecture suits long-term systems that evolve. Another way is to only add some on-demand custom features rather than developing the entire app from scratch. Keep in mind that microservices aren’t the only solution here. Other ones, like service-oriented architecture SOA, also force modular development around business capabilities, but microservices with DevOps provides a smaller, more fine-grained approach that allows you to accomplish the same objective.(6) Faster DevOps: If microservices architecture is implemented carefully, and with the right technologies in hand, it provides a significant boost of speed to both development and operations. DevOps helps to attain speed through people and technology. You can automate each element of the path to production. Thus, by using Microservices and DevOps, engineers in large product development may deploy code every tenth-of-a-second, reducing the number of outages. In a nutshell, DevOps helps operations and development engineers take part in the entire product lifecycle.Best Suited for Service-Driven Business ModelMicroservices architecture is best suited to service-driven business models, where the intent is to build products, not projects! Earlier, it was adopted for distributed or mission critical applications, but nowadays is used to renew and innovate almost all kinds of industries –  no matter if they are small scale or have millions of users. Some examples include HR and Payroll, Telecommunication, Forestry, Energy, Retail, Digital Content Management, ECommerce, Manufacturing, Video streaming, Social media and Logistic.Love-hate relationshipI love doing the microservices architecture, for all the reasons I have mentioned above. The possible challenges that may come with doing microservices are when you get tangled up in complexity, scaling and deployments. With the right technology stack and experts in the field, you can target it correctly. As each microservice or product may have different storage and processing requirements, managing operations can become a nightmare if not communicated properly. Therefore, inter-team and inter-API communication is important!My recommendation to any enterprise is to first analyse the need for doing microservices architecture. Ask yourself these primary questions:Is my project size is too big and do I want to decompose functionalities into small services?
Do I want to increase reusability?
What about the utilization of DevOps and do I need low-cost and high-quality products?
Do I need to minimize overheads in terms of application deployment and support?
How can I eliminate bottlenecks while using resources sparingly?
Are innovations in technology stack & speed vital to my business?To step up to the next level in technology and innovation, microservices architecture helps organizations to build cost-efficient, scalable, fault-tolerant, and easy-to-manage products.

How to plan the ultimate IT portfolio simplification and get a lean tech stack in 6 months,/en/blog/2020/08/how-to-plan-the-ultimate-it-portfolio-simplification-and-get-a-lean-tech-stack-in-6-months/,Cloud / Alexander Michael / 31.8.2020,"Most medium to large companies have too big an IT portfolio for their business capabilities. Their tech stack has become overflowing with outdated, unused, and duplicate investments, resulting in complexity, inefficiency, and significant cost overheads.Do you know how many different applications there are in your company’s IT portfolio? 100? 200? 500 or more? How well are they aligned with the capabilities of your business?Are you aware of the yearly cost of managing those applications, and how much they hinder any development or transformations in your company?Portfolio complexity manifests in many ways. Other aspects that should sound a warning bell are:Nonexistent chargeback models for each line of business
Poor decision-making systems
Constant failing of transformational initiatives
Too many instabilities and operational issues
Inability to be responsive to business changesIf these are issues at your company, it might be worthwhile to revisit the composition of your IT portfolio.Most of the time the number of applications in a company’s portfolio could be greatly reduced just by minimizing the redundancies. After going through an IT simplification, many companies find they are lean, agile, and efficient and ready for transformation.When the situation is dire, fixing things up here and there rarely suffices. Rather, it’s usually best to do a careful, structured, and holistic IT clean up and establish governance to keep your tech stack lean in the future.In this article, we share our 3-step system to reintroduce simplicity to your IT infrastructure and keep that stack simple going forward.Why do IT infrastructures become complex in the first place?There’s nothing unordinary about rising complexity within IT. On the contrary, it’s only natural for an IT infrastructure to get more complex with time if nothing is intentionally done to prevent it.The major reasons for the rising complexity in an already fragmented portfolio are :Ever growing business needs
Rapid technology transitions
Mergers and acquisitionsInternal and external developments push organizations to increase the size of their application portfolio, mainly affecting CRMs, ERPs, business applications, portals, content management systems, reporting tools, and application platforms. New technologies are introduced constantly, but less attention is given to cleaning up obsolete applications.Mergers and acquisitions increase redundancy in the system as usually applications for the same business capabilities are added. When time pressure pushes on, it’s quite common to just quickly get the systems to communicate with one another, instead of pausing to look for the ideal integration approach.And as we all very well know, mess begets mess. When you add the fact that most organizations don’t have a dedicated person or group to look at the portfolio from a wider perspective, you’re well on your way to clutter highways. The result is often a motley crew of platforms with home-grown, off-the-shelf, and partner solutions.The benefits of decluttering your tech stackAlthough going through an IT simplification might seem like a daunting feat with no clear beginning or end (we know that closing the doors on the mess would seem much easier), the process is much more straightforward and rewarding than one would imagine.Once shown the first blueprints of the current IT infrastructure and suggestions for simplifications, most of the executives we work with get excited about the upcoming several months.Having someone assess the situation, point you in the right direction, and possibly even take care of the messy work, makes the whole process almost enjoyable. It’s almost like shining a light at the frightening figure in the corner of the room, and noticing it’s just a chair with a coat hanging on it.Objections aside, the tangible benefits of an IT simplification are cataclysmic.We’ve seen companies cut down their yearly application costs by 30%, and in some cases as much as 50 % as the result of eyeing their portfolio critically. Even in smaller portfolios, it’s almost guaranteed that duplicates, inefficiencies, and non-compliant systems will be found. Removing these will result in less money spent on licenses, hosting, standardization, and maintenance.Even more significant is the benefit that a lean tech stack enables. Digital transformation – that is, the ability to answer to changing market and consumer demands with technology – can be significantly slowed down by a bloated infrastructure. For example, changes to a customer experience of an application may depend on the ability of the application to adapt voice, text, and touch interfaces.Looking at it from this perspective, a simple portfolio can be the key to a company's growth, as opposed to a cluttered portfolio, which can eventually prove detrimental to the company's sustenance.Now that we’ve established that looking under the hood of your IT is worthwhile, let’s take a look at the process that we recommend companies to go through.TietoEVRY’s SIMPLIFY-IT frameworkTietoEVRY’s SIMPLIFY-IT offers a comprehensive portfolio analysis framework with tools, methodology, guidelines, templates and best practices to accelerate rationalization.Our method for discovering simplification opportunitiesDefine – Understanding the composition of the current portfolioSimplifying your IT should always begin by creating an inventory of all applications in use. The goal is to get a picture of your portfolio in terms of stability, architectural maturity, scalability, and complexity. As a precursor to this, you should set up a strong governance model to ensure the success of the simplification process.You’ll want to gather information about all the applications and tech stack your organization uses in one place. List all ERP applications, Custom Applications, CRMs, Portals, and other hardware and software in a simple spreadsheet or a database, and detail what they are being used for.Usually getting this information involves a semi-automated process, not only asking from the IT department but also looking at application logs, deployment environments, and talking with people from different parts of the organization. Different departments rarely know what’s going on outside their organizational walls in terms of the tech they use.Collecting information in one place will help notice unnecessary, duplicate, and outdated applications, understand their dependencies, and identify the opportunities for simplification. After the definition phase, you should have a clear picture of what applications your company uses, for what purposes, and what the future roadmap looks like.Discover – Create a shared view of what IT the business needsNext, you’ll need to dive deeper to understand how these applications serve your business. In this stage, it’s useful to bring all key stakeholders, typically the business and IT managers of each business line, around the same table.Understanding end-to-end business processes is key for identifying applications and redundancies that could be let go of so that core business capabilities are not harmed. This necessitates careful analysis.A useful tool at this point is the Business Capability Model (BCM). All enterprises, both large and small, function using a series of inter-related business capabilities.To complement the BCM, you’ll want to create technical views of the IT portfolio to visualize and understand the dependencies between different systems and applications. These views together should give you an idea of what your core business capabilities are, and what systems are needed to run them, also hinting what could be safely discarded.TietoEVRY’s Simplify-It framework adopts discovery across 5 different dimensions like Business, Applications, Platforms, Infrastructure, and Operations to enable a comprehensive analysis of the portfolio.Analyze – Deciding what to keep and what to let go ofThe last step of planning the IT simplification is analyzing what could be discarded, and creating a roadmap for the forthcoming simplification process carefully incorporating inflight projects.Doing a cost-benefit analysis will shed more light on the possible benefits, and get internal buy-in for the project. A good cost-benefit analysis details how much revenue is created by each line of business, and how large their IT spending is.Looking at the ratio between these two, you’ll get an idea of how much could be potentially saved with simplification efforts. Paying more to simplify than you’re looking to save is hardly worth the effort.Once you’ve taken these steps, you should have a clear enough picture of what your current tech stack looks like, what your core business capabilities are and what tech they’re dependent on, and where are the most glaring opportunities for simplification lie.From plan to execution – transforming the portfolioAs we all very well know, thinking about change and planning for change are only the first steps – there comes the time to act upon the plan that was made. At this point, applications are retired, consolidated, maintained, and modernized.When you’re nearing the end of the process, it’s a good idea to give some thought for the future: How will you keep your tech stack lean from now on? What precautions will you take to avoid adding unnecessary applications to your IT infrastructure? It is important to align simplification streams with the inflight initiatives to create a robust roadmap and reference architecture for the enterprise, which can prevent fragmentation of the application portfolio.Some good practices we’ve encountered are defining a roadmap, enabling information flow across department borders, and creating a governance model to keep the roadmap and reference architecture current and live.Closing remarksBy following this system you’ll have an optimized IT portfolio designed to run your business smoothly. A streamlined portfolio won’t slow down your efforts to develop your business, but actively support changes.For IT portfolios consisting of 200 to 500 applications, IT simplification from planning to execution can be done in 24 weeks. For small to medium-sized portfolios the time can be as little as 10 to 16 weeks.For us, the best part of the process is seeing our customers let go of their excess IT baggage, and achieve better business outcomes because of it. Consider it – maybe it’s not another new application you need, but a proper assessment of what already exists?TietoEVRY 20 years of experience in portfolio analysis, platform consolidation & application simplification, and large scale consolidations and divestments.

The P27 journey is gearing up - what are the main considerations for your bank?,/en/blog/2020/08/the-p27-journey-is-gearing-up-what-are-the-main-considerations-for-your-bank/,Data / Jarkko Turunen / 31.8.2020,"Ahead of the gameP27 will create a harmonized payments market across the Nordics to scale and modernize payments and transactions. The flexible and secure payments platform supports real-time batch, domestic and cross-border payments. With multiple currencies in use across the region, establishing an efficient common payments initiative for the Nordic countries was the logical step to take to support a better business environment moving forward, particularly in a region with such closely linked economies.P27 is a game-changer that will set the direction for real-time payments globallyBy moving away from a siloed approach to payments, the unification of multiple payment schemes will enable real-time and cross border payments at a low cost among the Nordic countries. Financial institutions will be able to continuously evolve to changing customer demands by utilizing unique technologies to build new value-added payment services as the initiative develops.What’s coming next?Batch (bulk) payments are a natural first step as it will generate payment volumes, while increasing automated payment processing efficiency for all parties. This will be done in accordance with the new NPC Credit Transfer Scheme Rulebook, launched earlier this year.Several banks have already confirmed their commitment to the P27 initiative. The banks are currently preparing to connect their systems to the P27 infrastructure and are in the planning phase for migrating payment volumes to the new clearing platform. By connecting to the system at this early stage, these front runner banks will gain the advantage of being first to offer clients new services while gaining costs savings from the new platform and harmonized payment processing. The targeted first window for joining the platform is during 2021.Following a successful launch, we expect to see the introduction of batch clearing for the other Nordic currencies, even if the exact timeline for this has not been confirmed yet. There is also a plan in the pipeline to offer overflow functionality services to access Euro-clearing, which will generate further payment clearing cost reductions.Beyond bulk paymentsP27 will be launched stepwise. Starting with cost reduction of bulk payments is a natural first step. However, while moving funds in real-time is great, even more opportunities will arise from the introduction of request-to-pay and the possibility to simplify invoicing and bill payments for Nordic companies and consumers.The Nordic request-to-pay will be central to P27 as it will allow banks to support the request of payments among customers of P27 participants. The service will be built on the ISO20022 message standards and will meet the future Nordic Payment Council’s request-to-pay scheme. This is a clear example of how value-added services are contributing to the future of seamless payments. We have already explored the connection between real-time adoption and value added services in our latest whitepaper that you can read here.I look forward to the development of the new payments ecosystem and seeing the steps taken by P27 to create the Nordic cross-border instant payments infrastructure. The next months and years will definitely transform the existing payments systems in the Nordics and in doing so further improve the competitiveness of the region.In conclusion…The new payments initiative will bring many benefits to participants. However, to get the most out of it, banks and other financial institutions must begin assessing their existing IT landscapes and answering the following questions:What is the overall payments strategy – what customers will we serve and what services will we offer in the future?
How can our existing solutions support and adopt the P27 steps and requirements moving forward?
How and when can we transition to P27 SEK batch payments?At Tietoevry, we are heavily involved in the Nordic payments sector. We support many banks and financial services providers with their account and card-based payments – both batch-oriented and real-time. In addition, we are in regular contact with payment stakeholders such as regulators, industry bodies as well as FinTech companies who extend the payment ecosystems. Our goal is to bring the greatest benefit to our customers by sharing market knowledge, providing strategy advise and delivering technical solutions to meet specific requirements.Feel free to reach out to me if you are planning on joining P27 or require support to better understand the upcoming challenges and the optimal course of action for your business.", Jarkko Turunen ,Data , 31.8.2020
The commercial side of OpenStack cloud software,/en/blog/2020/08/the-commercial-side-of-openstack-cloud-software/,Meet our people / Marcin Nicpon / 27.8.2020,"Open source OpenStack solutions are based on the core technologies that come from the OpenStack community (openstack.org).  
Commercial solutions use the same core technologies, but technologies are turned into real commercial products. This means they deliver fully integrated, validated, automated software packages with guaranteed maintenance services.There is no easy answer on which way to go, as both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. It all depends on the situation, use case and market.    In terms of cost, service providers calculate the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), which includes the cost of licensing, integration, maintenance, flexibility (adding new features) and operation.   The open-source solution brings no licensing costs; however, it does require more skilled staff to integrate, deploy, customize and optimize OpenStack software components, or provide maintenance – which can lead to the same exceptional benefits as commercial solutions.    At the same time, having skilled staff enables service providers for much more flexibility to choose specific components or add more features by themselves when needed.   In contrast, the commercial option provides “out of the box” solutions with guaranteed maintenance, as well as a great level of automation and support. It reduces the need to build new skills in-house, in turn reducing Time To Market (TTM) for the deployment and monetization of new services. However, it does come with licensing fees. New features and component choice are also a bit more limited, as it is up to the software vendor to decide what goes into the package and what features come first, according to their roadmaps.Read more: If you want to learn more about the history of OpenStack and the software stack itself, please have a look at my previous blog post 'The OpenStack Story'.OpenStack deployments and maturityOpenStack software’s maturity is proven by several deployments across many different industry sectors, such as data centres, automotive, telecom and retail. 75%* of total deployments are on-premise private cloud.    More details about OpenStack deployments can be found here.

It also pinpoints areas of work that can be streamlined. This necessary information is collated during interviews and observational visits.The wishes of our customers and the views of our healthcare process experts are gathered by our multi-professional development team so they can develop an appropriate product concept. Objectives are set for product development: what benefits will it offer, and what mechanisms will deliver these to the users. The concept design work continues in ideation until the answers that meet the goals and value promises are found.Users are re-involved in the evaluation and validation of the concept with the developed prototype. This process is repeated several times, with user feedback driving product idea development. Actual production only commences after the conceptualization and validation process is completed. We also collect user feedback on the completed solution and carry out final usability testing.Good deployment essential for successA solution that is developed with user-centric design and methodology will only work if it is supported by tailored implementation and training. We are constantly developing our deployment and support services to ensure maximum results for the users.At present, our investment focus is on the flow of information through the product development process: the information chain must remain unbroken from the start of the planning phase through to the optimal use of the product. This means our workflow experts are involved throughout the process; from design to deployment. More than ever before, our product management, product development and implementation support experts all work collaboratively.Future-proofing user needsThe whole process of identifying a user need and introducing a new product or functionality can take between one and three years. This means we cannot just consider the issues of today, but we must understand and consider how these might change in the future.However, there are times when operational changes are needed urgently, and the improvements made and implemented during product development have not been able to solve the problem quickly enough. When this happens, our expert consultants can help the client utilize existing solutions in new ways; is the system and its functionalities being used in an optimal way? Can new workflows be created? This approach gives our customers a quick solution to their challenge.These processes both have common objectives and outcomes: to meet the customer’s needs, involve users in the design process, and ensure continuity. A well-managed development chain ensures the implementation of a new product or workflow will work seamlessly with previously developed work.The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated user-driven developmentWhen the corona pandemic struck Finland in March, we quickly identified the needs of users, customers, and wider society alongside our own planning work. We redirected product development resources to corona-related issues, focused on the development of ideas, and accelerated the decision-making process. At its fastest, it took about a week for us to identify the need and release the solution. To make it easier for our customers to use and take advantage of the system quickly and effectively, we worked on creating a  series of instructions alongside a swift release of new functionalities and products including Covid-19 diagnosis, isolation and quarantine forms, SMS services, and video appointments.Customers play a key roleActively engaged customers are the key to successful user-centric design. Users who are happy to participate in developing ideas and providing feedback are crucial to the approach. But this alone will not make the solutions work, there also needs to be a corporate culture which elevates and values the needs of the user and the customer.We must continue to develop our understanding and knowledge of user-centred development methods. This should work together with our robust technology and user-friendly system architecture to enable user-centric product development. Successful deployment requires an understanding of and expertise in healthcare processes, as well as the ability to integrate new system functionalities with the customer’s existing operational processes. Our team of experts cover the professional spectrum to ensure that we deliver significant value to our customers.As a healthcare process development expert, I work every day to meet customers’ needs.Read more about our healthcare and welfare solutions and services", Sanna Kallankari ,Meet our people , 21.8.2020
Heart in the clouds – cloud transformation benefits you don’t want to miss,/en/blog/2020/08/cloud-transformation-is-a-trip-you-dont-want-to-miss/,Cloud / Alberto Valero / 21.8.2020,"I see the cloud as being about innovation more than anything else. It is about empowering business units and developers to be more self-sufficient and to eliminate organizational silos. I also clearly see this passion is shared throughout TietoEVRY. Our job is to accelerate change and innovation for our customers.At the same time, we transform organizations, ensure business continuity and operational excellence and enable efficiency gains as well as improve agility and speed in order to facilitate innovations. And the cloud is very much driving these goals, so what is there not to be excited about?Cloud computing benefits for business: boosts adaptability for market shiftsIn the Nordics, our societies are open and transparent. That is why the Nordic region is probably the most advanced region in Europe in terms of cloud adoption – we openly embrace innovations and change.The ultimate aspiration for our customers embarking on the cloud journey is to increase business innovation speed. Companies need to become more responsive to market shifts and, for example, changes in consumer behaviours and patterns to enable them to adapt more quickly by developing faster digital products. And this can only be done if you embrace cloud solutions with agility.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst accelerating the adoption of digitalization, which makes sense because, at its core, digital business is about interacting more effectively with your customer and employees.The cloud enables a dual agenda: renewing current business and innovating new onesBut to embark on a successful cloud journey, the mindset needs to be right. Organizations cannot just implement the cloud – it needs to be truly adopted. Because at its core, cloud transformation means adopting a cloud operating model. It all starts by mapping out and navigating the journey.Having a framework for managing the transition from end to end, from legacy systems to the clouds – meaning private cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud and multi-cloud – with consistency, with proper security and data governance and with consistent financial governance and technology governance.Then, the transformation can move forward, with certain elements of the operating model in place, such as tools and processes. Through this approach, we can get to an AI-powered cloud-oriented operating model, with DevOps and automation by design. A cloud operating model that caters to both legacy IT and cloud IT in a unified fashion can be a north star for the journey to nimble, nearly invisible OpsSo, there you go – the cloud has a dual agenda so to speak. It provides a push both to renew and optimize current businesses and to innovate new ones. Also, with the mindset of adopting the cloud through operation model transformation, the higher speed of innovation can be truly reached. This then results in the wanted business outcomes and true cloud benefits: business agility, cost reductions, operational resiliency, increased security, and always up-to-date environments.The cloud is not a destination, but a journeyI personally believe that organizations cannot afford to turn their back on the cloud. Simple as that. An organization cannot protect its business by holding onto the past. The only way to remain competitive is by transforming, by leading the way for your customers and other main stakeholders.Companies who have not yet adopted the cloud might now learn the hard way why modernizing IT and leveraging the cloud is so important. The ongoing situation and sudden changes in patterns and consumption is proof that organizations need to be both responsive to these changes and agile enough to adapt. I see a clear correlation between cloud adoption and cloud maturity of companies and how well they perform financially.Transforming through the cloud does not mean leaving everything else behind. The key is to embrace end-to-end thinking – having an operating model that preserves the strengths of legacy systems as well as the modernization possible through the cloud.The challenge of achieving these two aspects under one consistent umbrella of integrated and customer-context-rich AI-powered operations excites me every time. With an enthusiastic or, dare I say, passionate cloud partner, even the most difficult transitions can be accomplished smoothly and to great effect.", Alberto Valero ,Cloud , 21.8.2020
Join us on the fight against cyberbullying – an initiative for more inclusive online behavior,/en/blog/2020/08/join-us-on-the-fight-against-cyberbullying/,Sustainability / Kia Haring / 20.8.2020,"Cyberbullying has been an issue for a long time, but it has become increasingly relevant now as kids spend more and more time online – both socially and, as we’ve seen this year, in remote classrooms.When schools moved to remote education during spring 2020, bullying moved to online channels. Working together with Finnish teenagers from various lower secondary schools we found out that 81% of the youth who participated in this project considered cyberbullying a significant problem – and 65% had been bullied themselves. In Sweden, 43% of kids aged 12–17 have been subjected to cyberbullying and 68% know someone who has been exposed to it*. The situation can be estimated to be alike in Norway, and similar trends can be seen all over the world.Together with our partners, we created The Polite Type – the first ever font that has been taught to recognize and rewrite online hate speech. As a Nordic digital services and software company, we at TietoEVRY wanted to advance the safety and wellbeing of the young – and the responsible use of technology. Together with our long-term partners Children and Youth Foundation and the creative company TBWA\Helsinki we created something tangible to raise awareness on cyberbullying – hoping to create a long-lasting impact through public discussion.The Polite Type recognizes hurtful words and terms as you write and replaces them with more appropriate and inclusive ones. The word library has been developed together with schoolchildren aged 12–17, and in close collaboration with a diverse team of experts, with wide-ranging backgrounds in linguistics, anti-racism work, gender research and Diversity & Inclusion consulting.The aim of The Polite Type is not to censor anyone. We want to encourage its users to be more considerate to others. With the font, you can express your opinions, disagree and even argue – it just nudges you to think about the impact of the words you choose.Now we need your help. This open-source font can be tested on the website and downloaded for offline use. Anyone can access the font. Please join us, test and try the font, and share your thoughts and feelings. Together we can find ways to use technology to encourage people to be kinder to each other – and to create a more inclusive every day.Many thanks for your help!(*) According to the Youth Online study (Cybercom 2018).

The ICT sector is at the heart of the fight against climate change,/en/blog/2020/08/the-ict-sector-is-at-the-heart-of-the-fight-against-climate-change/,Sustainability / Satu Kiiskinen  / 18.8.2020,"""Energy and Electricity Consumption of the ICT-sector in Finland"", a study published in spring 2020 by the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy (ETLA) and Aalto University, sends a clear message on how difficult it is to monitor the environmental impacts of data usage by country. In the ICT sector, obtaining a general overview is complicated because data flows cross borders. For instance, services used in Finland can also activate data centres in countries with no mutual electricity production. Since all climate work is based on transparency and auditability, it is essential to obtain credible, comparable information across countries on the environmental aspects of data.Information circulates in global networks and the energy usage of data may not be reflected in country-specific emission calculations. However, the transparency and reliability of emission calculations are essential to monitor and reduce the climate impact of the sector as a whole, in line with the agenda for sustainable development.It is clear that the demand for energy consumption increases together with the amount of data and the use of ICT equipment, even if not in the same proportion as the amount of data owing to energy efficiency. On the other hand, the technology industry has the tools to fight climate change. As stated in the recent interim report of the ICT Working Group on Climate and Environmental Strategy, the sector consumes energy and materials, but also can lead towards a carbon-neutral society.  ICT makes it possible to reduce the energy consumption of various industrial processes and via optimisation replace physical products, promote the foundation of a resource-efficient urban infrastructure with a smaller carbon footprint, and wider transit the economy towards a circular economy that utilises resources more sustainably.With the help of new technologies and renewable energy sources, the production of energy is getting more environmentally friendly. From the climate change point of view it is therefore essential to know how the electricity, that is being used to produce data, is consumed. In emission calculations, the coefficient used for the conversion of electricity to carbon dioxide emissions depends on the structure of electricity production in each country. Globally, fossil fuels still play a major role in electricity production. When compared internationally, electricity consumed in Finland is relatively carbon-free.One key to limit emissions is to take them into account already in the planning work. For example, the placement of data centres can significantly contribute to emissions. TietoEVRY benefits from Nordic data centres whose energy efficiency and usage of renewable energy are world-class. The continuous monitoring of emissions and addressing anomalies is another important part of our environmental work. Our concrete goal is to continue to increase the energy efficiency of our data centres and to use electricity produced from renewable energy sources, mainly wind power, in Nordic data centres. In addition, we donate heat back to the district heating network from the Espoo data centre. This energy heated 745 households in Espoo last year.This opinion piece by Satu Kiiskinen, Managing partner, Finland, TietoEVRY was originally published in Kauppalehti.", Satu Kiiskinen  ,Sustainability , 18.8.2020
3 things to expect from your future digital healthcare,/en/blog/2020/08/3-things-to-expect-from-your-future-digital-healthcare/,Data / Tietoevry at your service / 10.8.2020,"The “Health in the 21st century” report by the OECD from 2019 paints a glooming picture of digitization in the health sector. In summary, the report estimates the health sector to be two decades behind other sectors like banking and retail when it comes to leveraging new digital opportunities. Needless to say, vast amounts of resources could be saved by taking a more proactive approachOn average, the OECD health budgets allocate 5% to digitization. The report, however, predicts that by doubling this share, the return would be three times as much in time saved, cost reductions and most importantly, patient satisfaction.Smart use of data, IoT, predictions through AI and cloud-based systems are some of the tools that could make patients more satisfied with the healthcare they are offered, and in addition, save taxpayer money and create a better resource allocation within healthcare – so that doctors and nurses get to spend more of their time on the most pressing duties, the patients they care for.Although work remains to be done, some countries are already experiencing what the new technologies have to offer. Below are a couple of examples of how they’ve applied new tech to make society healthier.Utilizing AI to predict future health needs in EspooIn 2018, TietoEVRY conducted an experiment with the city of Espoo to predict future health needs of their 250 000 citizens. The experiment combined the social, healthcare and early education client relationship data of the entire population for the years 2002–2016.By analyzing this data mass, new preventive methods were identified for targeting services to citizens, for example, to prevent social exclusion. With support from AI and data analytics, new service paths can be developed. Social and healthcare service professionals can also utilize AI in their daily work to support decision making. A sign of the bourgeoning use of AI to make health care more proactive.Lillehammer using IoT to dispense medication correctlySince 2014, the Norwegian town of Lillehammer has used automated medicine-dispensing robots as part of an effort to ensure home care residents receive the right medicine at the right time. Now, the robots have been integrated with the Norwegian Gerica medical records system delivered by TietoEVRY. The integration boosts automation and frees up the time of nurses to focus on important clinical tasks.Technical alerts such as ""medicine delivered"" and ""medicine not delivered"" from the robots are automatically logged in the medical record system before being communicated to a home service application used by healthcare professionals.Lillehammer has had 26 medication robots from in use during the project period. Now they are ready to grow that number. Between 80 and 100 users are mapped, and the aim is for 70 medication robots to be rolled out by mid-June 2020.Connecting the elderly to their care providers digitallyIn the future, there will be fewer care providers delivering the elderly care, while at the same time, care providers will increase the treatment and care for patients in their own homes.In 2020, TietoEVRY started a joint innovation project with two Swedish municipalities, Malmö City and Kristianstad, with the aim of investigating how to introduce digitalization into the homes of users of a home care service. This was done through the voice-activated assistant “Florence”.The goal was to use technology to support staff and users with a focus on three key areas:Reducing the number of alarms activated for reasons other than an emergency.
Increasing the independence and well-being of the elderly.
Freeing up precious time for employees in the home care service ecosystem.The first phase of the test period was completed in April 2020. So far Florence is only a prototype and we are excited about continuing the examination and development of the service together with our customers.", Tietoevry at your service ,Data , 10.8.2020
Boost IT operations with artificial intelligence – this is what AIOps is all about,/en/blog/2020/08/boost-it-operations-with-artificial-intelligence--this-is-what-aiops-is-all-about/,Data / Vincent Aardalsbakke / 3.8.2020,"AIOps is changing the gameOperational efficiency has always been on the agenda for organizations looking to succeed in their field, but only within the last couple of years have IT operations really embraced AI as a means of improving their services. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in IT Operations (Ops) has led to AIOps, an umbrella term that refers to the use of AI across all primary functions within IT operations.The complexity of the tools needed today and the separation of functions in operations have created the siloes of data and business processes that AIOps is poised to solve. A key enabler is therefore data coming from all levels of the IT stack, from infrastructure to applications. Incidents, events, network performance and changes are the data you want to aggregate before utilizing machine learning to enable event correlation and root cause analysis. The right use of this output can provide actionable insights and automation that will improve both operator and end-user experiences.While AI capabilities have been increasingly deployed in recent years, there’s always a hesitance to interfere with the most trusted and most critical systems. That game is changing. All sectors have been both implementing RPA processes to automate manual tasks and playing around with proofs-of-concept within emerging technologies. However, the increasing complexity of the underlying services creates the need for an intelligent and proactive IT infrastructure.The Ops that comes with AIOpsThe most important impact of AIOps in any organization is not really the tools and architecture. Your developer has probably played around with some of these tools already, and your engineers and architects will have no trouble finding the proper landing zone for you.The impact you should care about is the cultural shift necessary to enable the right cross-team collaboration. This requires a new mindset – some of us must admit that success in operations is about more than just being stable, secure and reliable. Now is the time to empower the professionals closest to the problem. They are the ones who can create tomorrow’s solution through CI/CD and DevOps toolkits. But DevOps has been around for years, so why now?The latest tools and platforms enable many more people to take part in the AI journey. “Everyone” can create an AI proof-of-concept or even push one into production, but many struggle with scalability and sustainability, and haven’t yet considered the implications of continuously managing the machine learning lifecycle in production, often referred to as MLOps.How to manage your new AIOps capabilities and the required collaboration isn’t always clear, so you should consider the options carefully before deciding how to proceed in this important area.There are generally two options. You can buy a platform with embedded AI functionality and a training studio, or you can build the AI solution yourself, often from public cloud APIs and capabilities. The popularity of the first option has grown rapidly over the last few years within areas like IT monitoring and chatbots, but the latter option remains an approach trusted by data scientists working directly with the data. Both models can work, but it’s important to consider the effect the decision has on the organization – and the management your choice requires.It’s difficult to build and maintain everything yourself, and even if you could, there might not be a sustainable business case for total in-house control of all capabilities. This is the time for business owners to step up their game and join the AI journey. It’s more important than ever to identify how AIOps can add value to the team and overall business, and if you want to improve SLAs, reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) and increase the quality of your daily operations, you already have a starting point.Want to boost your operations?

Time for fintech to break down the walls of cards businesses!,/en/blog/2020/07/the-fintech-dilemma-how-to-evaluate-and-collaborate-to-bring-added-value-to-the-cards-business/,Digitalization / Evita Kalmane-Pivkina / 29.7.2020,"Historically, banks have had closed systems. Over the years we’ve seen that when a new and interesting services or functionalities hit the market, banks typically try to replicate them within their environments to safeguard the platform. Today, however, there are so many innovative ideas and opportunities that it’s no longer possible to do this and keep pace with competitors. Flexibility is key. Integrating a Fintech product bypasses the long and complicated development cycles that are necessary in a closed system. This obviously saves you both time and money.Choosing a Fintech partnerOf course, as you know, you can’t simply integrate any service into a bank’s offering. Products have to pass stringent testing and meet regulatory and security requirements. And the more third-party products that are integrated, the higher the demands are on the system and the team responsible for it. Therefore, processes have to be put in place to manage Fintech co-operations – both from a technical and relationship perspective.So how do you evaluate a potential partner? Based on our experience we believe these are the key factors to consider:Make sure you establish clear evaluation criteria (financial, business models, functional, etc.) at the start of the process and convey your expectations to potential providers. 
Have clear communication among all involved parties, including the bank and the Fintech.Make sure relevant bank stakeholders are involved in key presentations, meetings and discussions.Ensure evaluation is done together with multiple stakeholders in order to get a holistic overview of requirements and impact.Keep the evaluation and decision-making process transparent for all parties involved.Make sure you have access to technical tools for sandboxing and testing potential partner products. Likewise provide them with product APIs for testing.Once a partner has been chosen, we believe it’s important to align expectations regarding goals and the collaborative processes, as well as setting achievable KPIs. You should also set up a plan for communication, data exchange and storage. Involve project participants at an early stage so they understand the scope and delivery plans.  Establish clear process for monitoring and control. And lastly, set parameters for potential changes in delivery, after all technology will continue to advance even through the project is in progress.The right model for your risk appetiteIn our view, the type of collaboration and deployment model that suits your structure will depend heavily on your risk appetite and the core system setup you have, e.g., if it’s inhouse, on-prem or cloud-based. The different models include:Customer => Bank => Core vendor =>  Fintech :  whereby the bank’s core IT vendor is responsible for technical integrations and upkeep and therefore takes the majority of the partner risk  
Custumer => Bank => Fintech :   whereby the bank is responsible for implementation/updates and takes the majority of the risk. If necessary required system integration is done by the bank itself or ordered from core vendor. 
Customer => Fintech => Bank :    Fintech takes the majority of the risk whereby the bank only states that services is provided directly by Fintech. This way the bank  minimizes it’s risks and responsibility of service delivery, at least from legal perspective. It is also a simpler onboarding procedure for the bank. In this case the end-customer takes part of the risk by choosing to use the service or product provided by third party.As an established vendor of banking services, we have multiple collaborations with Fintechs, often on behalf of banks. Through this business model, banks can get access to the service or feature, while we handle the relationship (although banks often take an active role in the collaboration) and product integration to our core platform. Using our proven onboarding processes, we have simplified Fintech evaluation and selection and ensured smooth product implementations.Related blogs:A digital card experience for a more profitable futureTokenization: the secure way to support merchants, consumers and IoT paymentsThe AI OpportunityLearn more on Card and financial product management related blog and insight series, case studies and more - click here.", Evita Kalmane-Pivkina ,Digitalization , 29.7.2020
How to tackle ethics in your day-to-day work,/en/blog/2020/07/how-to-tackle-ethics-in-your-day-to-day-work/,Sustainability / Carina Wiman / 16.7.2020,"The problems we have to solve in the tech industry are often very complex. That’s why this industry attracts so many talented engineers, designers and business developers. Tough challenges are fun to solve! So, how can we leverage the talent of team members to tackle the ethical challenges of the product or solution we’re developing?Well, while there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach, there are some really fundamental questions that each team could start by addressing.1. What is it we are developing?Take a step back from all the technical, user and business perspectives for a while and focus on the value the solution is intended to provide and for whom. Does it address any of the UN Sustainable Development Goals? Will it improve society? Are the intentions morally positive, negative or neutral?A solution to empower elderly people to live more independently has morally positive intentions; a solution to create audio deepfakes to commit fraud has morally negative intentions. This question is not about how the solution is developed or how it could be misused (they are addressed in other questions). Instead, it’s about what the solution itself is intended to do and how ethical that is.While answering this question, it might be useful to consult experts who are not working directly in the tech industry. Moral philosophers, human rights experts and environmental scientists might have insights your team could benefit from. Reach out to them!2. Who are we?The 2018 video game Assassins Creed: Odyssey has a starting screen which proudly tells the user that it was developed by a “…multicultural team of various beliefs, sexual orientations and gender identities”. This team decided that if they were to build an inclusive experience they need to be an inclusive team.The second ethical question is therefore about understanding your team. Who are you, what are your team biases, how can these biases influence the direction of the solution and how can you counteract them? It is rarely a bad idea to involve real users in the development of a product and this is a great way to uncover bias in your team. Which all leads to the next question…3. Who are our users?How will your users’ lives change as a result of your solution and how can you make sure the change is positive? Well, firstly you need to understand them. This is a fundamental principle in Design Thinking and, thankfully, not a new concept in software development. It’s about building empathy with real users and bringing them into the development process. It’s about accessibility, inclusion and understanding the impact your solution will have on real people.4. What could possibly go wrong?Even with the best of intentions, how might your solution be misused? What are the consequences of this misuse and, most importantly, what can you do now in the development of your solution to prevent that misuse? Take Anonymous Messaging, for example. If you take the time to consider it then cyberbullying might well pop up as an unintended consequence. So, as a team, you ask yourselves, ‘what can be done to prevent this being used as a bullying tool?’Through answering the above questions you have created your own Ethical Declaration.This declaration is something which every team member should be familiar with. Some teams print theirs out and pin it to the wall. It colours the direction of the project and is something which becomes a living artefact, constantly updated and adjusted as the project progresses. The continuous adjustment is crucial. For each big step the project takes, for example for each large set of features it implements, the team has to consider how this impacts the Ethical Declaration and vice versa.The same process of assessing what is being built is also useful for customers. The customers might not understand the impact of what they are ordering and the ways in which the solution could be misused. Therefore, the creation of the Ethics Declaration is as much of an eye-opening experience for customers as it is for the team building the solutions. Our experience working with these questions is that inviting the customer into the process together with the development team is very rewarding.There will always be mistakes and there will always be teams that, for one reason or another, set the ethical bar too low. But, by bringing ethics to the frontline it’s much harder to accidentally create something unethical.", Carina Wiman ,Sustainability , 16.7.2020
The OpenStack Story,/en/blog/2020/07/openstack/,Cloud / Marcin Nicpon / 14.7.2020,"You may also hear about Cloud Native computing and containerized solutions, which create competition across the technological landscape for OpenStack and service orchestration. This is all correct – cloud-native gets a lot of traction – however, considering OpenStack maturity and the specific features it provides, it won’t disappear for years, constantly increasing its maturity and richness of features.    Before going there, let’s look at how this all started.   About 10 years ago, two companies, NASA and Rackspace, began building the first free, opensource cloud management software, which is now known as Nova. It was to focus on providing computing resources in a virtualized cloud environment, in order to deploy their cloud solution based on virtual machines and without spending a fortune. Since then, the whole project has grown to become a powerful package able to manage entire Cloud data centers. I will highlight the architecture of the software shortly.What is OpenStack?The OpenStack Foundation describes its software as “a Cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center, all managed and provisioned through APIs with common authentication mechanism”.  In other words, it is a software package that lets operators manage their data center through a single UI. It allows users to deploy new VMs, configure them, define network connections and storage amounts, routing rules, etc. Essentially, everything needed to easily manage modern computing systems. OpenStack is made up of various components, all of which play a role in managing the entire system.Source: http://www.openstack.org/Horizon - provides a single User Interface used for VM deployment, configuration and monitoring Nova - compute service, controls compute resources and provides its telemetryCinder - block storage service, provides control over block storage resources (i.e. SSD) Neutron - networking service, provides control over networking (network abstraction layer)Glance - provides services and libraries to store and manage bootable disk images Swift - object storage service, provides scalable object data storage Keystone - authentication service, provides common authentication methodsOf course, you can achieve the same results using native Linux with KVM as a hypervisor and Linux bridges or OVS. However, you can imagine how much work would be needed to do that for thousands of servers, while still ensuring the same time efficiency, automatic scalability and VM optimization as per resource utilization.We also cannot forget about security. Since a virtualized cloud environment is intended for multi-tenant use, every tenant needs to be separated from one other to avoid any data breaches. This just implies more complications in your manual deployment and is just the tip of the iceberg.   If you want to know more about architecture and history, I would recommend the resources below.Please note that there are several OpenStack solutions, both commercial and opensource. 'Why this is happening’ is the topic for an upcoming blog post, to which I warmly invite you to read. Stay tuned!Further reading:Main OpenStack Open Source projecthttps://www.openstack.org/Commercial solutions (examples): https://www.mirantis.com/,   https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/openstack-platformGlossary https://docs.openstack.org/doc-contrib-guide/common/glossary.html", Marcin Nicpon ,Cloud , 14.7.2020
Ethics in technology – should I care?,/en/blog/2020/07/ethics-in-technology-should-i-care/,Sustainability / Carina Wiman / 8.7.2020,"On a personal level, ethics can also be a difficult subject. Most people inwardly reflect on the moral consequences of what they do, but at the same time, those consequences are rarely discussed out loud. This is especially true in the working environment.Most companies have a Code of Conduct, which gives guidance to employees on what is considered acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. In addition, many companies have guidance on how to conduct business ethically, such as choosing the right suppliers and how to avoid unethical business practices.Obviously, it is a good thing to have these practices in place, but more should be done to breathe life into these corporate-level entitles and bring ethics to a place where solutions are designed, coded and delivered.In the past few years, we have seen some examples of poor ethics in the development and deployment of technologies. Social media applications, which were intended to be platforms for sharing positive experiences, have been shown to undermine democratic processes. Further, we’ve seen the world’s biggest social media platform sell the personal data of 50 million users without their consent.Another development is what could be called grassroots ethics, which sees employees speaking up and, in some cases walking out when their employer does something unethical. This is very encouraging because if there is a frontline in the battle between ethics and business, it’s not in the boardroom but on the team’s own whiteboard.Ethical mistakes are typically oversightsA great thing about humanity is that there are, in fact, very few teams in the technology industry who intentionally set out to build something unethical. If a product or service is unethical, it’s typically due to oversight, accident or ignorance. It’s not a deliberate attempt to make something unethical, but rather that ethics never really entered the creative process.And that’s not surprising. For a digital solution to be successful in 2020, you need to navigate through increasing customer needs and stressed business targets to satisfy a lot of demands:It has to be satisfying a need or no one will buy it. 
It has to have a fantastic user experience or users will migrate to a competing product. 
It has to have a robust technical architecture or the cost of development over time will be crippling. 
There has to be a solid business case, including a realistic return on investment and profitability. 
All national and supranational legislation needs to be understood and adhered to.In this hectic space, it is very difficult for a team member to raise their hand and say: ‘Stop! Just what is this thing we are developing and what consequences will it have?’That’s how ethics gets pushed aside. That is how a well-meaning team accidentally develops the perfect tool to facilitate cyberbullying. They didn’t set out to do it, it was just that safeguarding against it never became a priority.Today, ethics are not high enough on the agenda and not given the attention they deserve. When they do get attention, they are too easily cast aside in favour of other, more prioritised, goals. The tech industry (including both suppliers and customers) needs to learn new ways and new routines to manage the rising ethical challenges, in a way that doesn’t stifle innovation or slow growth.Ethics need to be considered when you have a decision to make that will impact the lives of many people. This could be a decision related to city planning, national legislation or, to take a more recent example, the restrictions placed on society as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. As mentioned earlier, technology has developed quickly and is now an integral part of most people's life – either directly or indirectly.So, how can we consider ethics as a key topic when we develop new solutions? We offer concrete tips and tricks in our next blog. Stay tuned and join the discussion on social media!", Carina Wiman ,Sustainability , 8.7.2020

13 hacks to really master the art of remote work,/en/blog/2020/06/13-hacks-to-really-master-the-art-of-remote-work/,Digitalization / Tietoevry at your service / 3.7.2020,"Here is how to truly adapt and become a super user of digital office spaces.The lived experience of remote office may come in the same range as the numbers of people using them. Some find it pleasant to get up five minutes before their first meeting, while others get frustrated by not leaving their “workspace” when the workday is over.A recent survey by YouGov for TietoEVRY shows that COVID-19 has had a positive impact on how many of us think about remote work: one third of Swedes (33%) and Finns (31%) say that they have a more positive attitude towards remote work. In Norway, one fourth (25%) is more positive now than before the corona outbreak.“A positive from the remote office experience for me is that productivity levels have remained similar to before COVID19. One of the biggest fears was that productivity would drop, but that has not been the case”, says Kristian Schäfer, Consultant with us at TietoEVRY, working with Design Thinking.He is one out of close to 24 000 colleagues that have been working remotely for almost three months now due to the outbreak of the Corona virus this spring.In the YouGov Survey 14 percent of Finns and 15 percent of Norwegians said they work even more efficiently remotely, while 16 and 23 percent felt that their work efficiency was declining. In Sweden 29 percent felt they worked less efficiently from home.Kristian believes that most people are more than capable of performing more self-leadership and don't necessarily need to have a manager or a leader attached in order for them to perform.“We have extremely competent employees today and perhaps the leadership theories have not entirely followed the same development trend. I think we could distribute far more of the perceived jobs we think a leader should perform to the employees”, he says.“Something totally unexpected”Managing Partner of TietoEVRY Sweden, Karin Schreil, is aware of the situation many leaders and employees may find themselves in due to the outbreak of COVID-19.“For a lot of organizations, this meant a sudden change to a digital way of working, something that was totally unexpected from their side. Many did not have the tools nor the knowledge on how to adapt to the situation. We are helping a lot of businesses and organizations reorganize into a form where remote work and digital leadership becomes the new normal”, Karin says.She also believes that skills such as openness, empathy, creativity and the ability to act as good examples, in addition to dare being innovative may be especially important for leaders now.“A major challenge that a lot of managers may be facing right now is balancing taking care of the employees’ needs and implementing efficient digital ways of working and collaborating”, Karin emphasizes.Three crucial factors for successful collaboration and leadershipØystein Sehlmann, Head of Process & Change Advisory at TietoEVRY, leads a team that assists organizations and businesses implementing digital tools for employees and management. According to him, here are three factors that are crucial in order to effectively take advantage of opportunities in this digital era:1. Correct tools for your organization’s needs2. Tailored training initiatives3. Clear goals and strategy for implementation and use“Access to tools and technology that enable you to work from home in a way that is as close to if you were at the office, is crucial. First of all, it’s about having the solutions that make it easy to share documents and files in addition to have efficient online meetings”, says Øystein.Microsoft 365 will cover the needs of most organizations. Tools like this also enhance effective internal communication.“Employees need both insights and skills to get the most out of technology. Microsoft Teams provides so much more than online meetings, storage and sharing of documents: there is also a whole range of apps that you can implement into this tool that will help you take the collaboration, projects and workshops to new levels”, Øystein explains.The last thing Øystein is highlighting is the most important one: clear goals, strategy and guidelines for the different tools.“Without them, people may start using the tools differently only to experience confusion, frustration and low business outcome as a result”, says Øystein.5 tips for successful remote workTurn the camera on! It is more inclusive and connects you to the team on a greater level, creating a sense of increased togetherness. Remember to give everyone room to talk.
 Make sure you work in a secured way. Make sure you have a VPN connection to use for the programs that handle a great level of confidential data. Check and make sure your antivirus program is updated.
 Collaborate in the Cloud. Everyone in your team is able to access the same documents and info when using cloud based digital tools. We guarantee you will save a great amount of time when you don’t need to send everything through e-mail.
 Record important meetings and share the info on tape. There is always someone who’s not able to join the meeting. Push the recordings button and you will have a video of the meeting to share for everyone to update themselves.
 Get some exercise! Take in some fresh air despite the fact that you don’t commute to work. Squeeze in some steps before work or during lunch time.5 tips for boosting remote leadershipSet a good example: Dare to be open about you not knowing everything. Instead, you should be curious about testing new ways of working, including using digital tools.
 Stay available for your team: Show them how they could reach you on different channels and be able to connect easily even though you are physically apart.
 Be proactive: Talk to your team members about how they feel about working remotely. Listen to how they are – and remember: turn your camera on when having joint conversations.
 Keep good habits: Focus on maintaining your ordinary routines such as weekly meetings and 1-2-1 coaching conversations – only to move them into a digital format.
 Make sure your community thrives: Invite to digital after-work events, lunch quizzes or Friday beers. Team building is still important – maybe more than ever.Four people on remote office:Robin Dronsfield, Head of EUS Advisory at TietoEVRY”Pro’s being that I save a lot of time and can get up later in the morning (I am a late sleeper). I also appreciate the fact of being home as soon as my workday is over. I work with a greater focus until my tasks are finalized compared to when I am at the office. I also perceive digital meetings as more inclusive, it is easier for everyone to be part of discussions when using video. On the downside, remote work requires a greater amount of meetings – at least for me who also has a social need to thrive at work. I sit, even more, lacking activity and it is sometimes harder to log off from work when your workspace is also your home.Kaja Drews, Consultant at TietoEVRYThe greatest part is to be able to wear clothes I normally don’t use! You know, the ones that may not be accurate enough for the office, but that I love wearing outside of work. I do believe that our meetings have become more efficient and it takes less time to attend a meeting: all you have to do is to click the “join meeting” button compared to the office where you may find a spare meeting room and often go to different floors! I find it challenging not to have an ergonomic office chair or proper workspace at home – and that I am most of the time physically alone.Niklas Andersson, Consultant at TietoEVRY“Reverting back to my university staple (instant noodles) for lunch 3 times a week, and never going out for lunch might provide a less rich social and culinary enjoyment, but this, combined with not spending 2,000 SEK/month on public transport, has been a big boost to my personal finances.”Nanna Wass-Gordon, Content Specialist at TietoEVRY“Good things are that I get more time with my kids, I can make dinners that take hours in the oven, there is no need for a public transport card and my house has never been cleaner. The bad things are that I feel lonely despite seeing people on a screen, my inspiration for new ideas becomes trickier to find without spontaneous conversations with random people, I constantly see things that could be improved at home (which means I go to IKEA once a week at least ) and I now consider clean sweats perfectly reasonable as a going-out outfit.", Tietoevry at your service ,Digitalization , 3.7.2020
What makes a great automation solution? Our take on the five selection criteria,/en/blog/2020/06/what-makes-a-great-automation-solution-our-take-on-the-five-selection-criteria/,Data / Himadri Das / 25.6.2020,"Whereas intelligent automation solutions help to reduce the costs of IT operations by 20-30 percent, the potential benefit is easily multi-fold when extending automation to support functions and business processes.Our ambition is to be fully equipped to deliver automation benefits for our Nordic customers.In March, we announced an automation partnership with Ayehu, a leader in intelligent automation. Our approach has generated interest among our customers, analysts and research communities alike. Info-Tech Research Group recently interviewed us about our automation vision and roadmap, along with drivers for our automation tool selection criteria. I believe that our five criteria – modularity, no-vendor locking, flexibility to expand, pre-built APIs, and a design thinking approach – are very applicable to many Nordic companies and organisations.As we at Tietoevry are on this journey, I wanted to take this opportunity to reflect on our key lessons learned from along the way.Let’s take a closer look at each criterion; Modularity, no-vendor locking, flexibility to expand, pre-built APIs and a design thinking approach.1. ModularityWe wanted to secure adaptation to different use cases and ensure that automation solutions function in all environments: on-premise, in the cloud, or in our customers’ private on-premises environments.Different customers have different expectations and needs. Some are looking into operating automation as self-service, some want to get support from the service desk, and the ones who have implemented automation on a wider scale might be looking for ways to orchestrate and manage automation systems effectively end-to-end. We wanted to be relevant, and to have solutions for all these needs, leveraging the public cloud, DevOps, AIOps and data lake capabilities.2. No-vendor lockingToday’s automation solutions have a great deal of valuable data. Considering data privacy and GDRP needs, it’s important that customers feel secure towards automating use cases and processes.Our customers need to be able to trust that if they move to another managed service provider in the future, or if they decide to in-source, they will be able to take their existing IT automation solution with them. Furthermore, automation use cases deployed by the service provider are the customer’s IPR and propriety.I believe that this is an important differentiator for us as a service provider. When automation infrastructure is independent of the Managed Service Provider that you choose, you don’t lose the automation infrastructure investment if that relationship ends.“It’s nice to see a large MSP promote lack of lock-in as a differentiator and to focus on relationship building and quality of service.”
Research by: Derek Shank, Info-Tech Research Group, April 14th, 20203. Flexibility to expandWe don’t want to fixate our customers on a single technical automation environment, thereby limiting automation scope and making architecture rigid and service provider-centric. Instead, we wanted to be able to build patterns that could be re-used for various customers and which would be applicable to the customers’ environments and architectures, e.g. as workflows for event management and incident resolution that should be configurable and orchestrated under any monitoring system and tools.4. Pre-built APIsWe wanted to be able to quickly and easily build a minimum viable product to show automation value to our customers, while also being able to further refine the solution to adapt to that customer’s environment. This approach requires the usage of pre-built APIs and Software Development Kits for integrating different tools and systems, relevant to the customer’s existing environment.5. A design-thinking approachCustomer engagement and co-innovation are crucial. Getting to know the customer environment is where the main use cases come up with a high degree of repeatability.Automation is about being able to concentrate on what makes an impactWe are driving increased automation to be able to provide more value and innovations to our customers. We want to be able to re-allocate experts to assignments and projects which will generate more value to our customers than manual and repetitive tasks that can be automated.Along the way, we have seen that a sound automation strategy and implementation ensures higher SLA adherence, higher end-user customer satisfaction, standardisation, adherence to higher quality, and employee satisfaction.To obtain the engagement necessary to make their efforts successful, organisations pursuing an automation program should prioritise effective change management communication and full leadership support.Do you already use your full automation potential?

APIs: what are they and why they are important to your business?,/en/blog/2020/06/api-monetization/,Data / Faezeh Pourbarzegar / 16.6.2020,"An API illustrates how to connect a dataset or a business process with a consumer application or another business process. APIs allow businesses to share data and services across their organization, and to their broader network of suppliers, partners and end customers.Three different types of APIsThere are three main types, based on how they are made available: Private API, Partner API, and Open API. It is important to understand and identify the different advantages and limitations of these three types:Private APIs focus more on the internal operations in the business. They help to increase productivity and efficiency.  
Partner APIs allow partners access to your software’s valuable information. Thus, it can help the business to improve and strengthen external relationships as well as grow its network to reach their partners’ customers.  
Public APIs, also known as Open APIs, can help businesses to add new revenue streams and monetize their digital assets. They can also be thought of as building blocks that enable third-party developers to build applications and services that leverage the business’s data and capabilities, which can ultimately extend the presence of the business in different markets.API monetizationAPI monetization is the process by which businesses create revenue from their APIs. In recent years, a huge number of companies have been able to generate revenue through new business models and new offerings through APIs.     Monetization allows API providers to move beyond their current business models, scale API programs, and find new ways to create value for their customers, developers, and partners. APIs empower developers to harness data and create new services for the whole business ecosystem: companies, customers, developers and end-users.    To monetize APIs, public APIs are the way to go. There are many routes that businesses can take as they open their APIs. For example, the preference may be to first develop private API or internal APIs before opening them up.     There are a few things to consider when looking at API monetization. What’s your strategic goal and business case? What’s the market need and who is the API for? How will you measure success? Answering these questions should help identify the best way to approach monetization.API solution service benefitsWhen moving to an API-driven culture, you need to think about these aspects:Which API strategy best suits your business best?  
When considering open APIs, do not assume that “if you build it, developers and money will come”. Businesses may need a strategy to get the word out.  
API Monetization is a comprehensive and adaptable solution that enables businesses to generate new revenue streams from their digital assets.How to start with APIsTo get started, you need a centralized solution to first estimate the business’s capability and then design a roadmap to publishing and maintaining an open API. This decision should be based on the business features and capabilities and designing a revenue model, etc. and at the end developing the APIs.  To help you succeed with your API monetization journey, we have created an API monetization framework.Eager to learn more?

How a custom Teams application can help to work more efficiently – learnings from the City of Helsinki,/en/blog/2020/06/how-a-custom-teams-application-can-help-to-work-more-efficiently/,Digitalization / Niina Nykänen / 8.6.2020,"We see Teams as a great back office hub for handling data, process items and collaborate. Teams application can be integrated to end-users’ channels, or alternatively to employees’ channels.With custom Teams application as a back office solution it is possible to:enable the customers’ or employees’ voice to be heard and implement two-way communication towards the customers/employees.
make the handling transparent with workflows, collaboration and reporting.
maximize automation and efficiency by increasing intelligence.
take a sensitive information into account.
make processing possible even in the field conditionsUnleash the ideas of employees: case City of HelsinkiWe have built this kind of back office solution for the City of Helsinki to handle employees’ ideas and initiatives. Employees can enter the ideas via the third-party channel from which the ideas and initiatives move to a Teams application through an integration. The items are then handled in the Teams transparently by the handlers from the different city services. The statuses are reported with Power BI.There was a significant need for such a solution since the ideas and initiatives were earlier handled manually in Excel. The processing work was time consuming, inconvenient and non-interactive. It was challenging to coordinate the process since the handlers were working in different city services. The reporting was also difficult and there were difficulties to get an up-to-date status information of the handling process. Additionally, the handling process lacked interactivity and there was no flexible filtering and search options for the ideas.It was decided to implement the solution to Teams because it was already a familiar tool for the employees in the City of Helsinki. Our role was to design and implement the solution, and train the key people to use it. The implementation was a quick and an agile project, and the solution was easy to adopt and learn. There was no need for massive end-user training sessions and user manuals since the solution was so intuitive to use. The project was carried out agilely in close collaboration and hence the City of Helsinki got a polished solution that perfectly suited to their needs. We can say that the agile delivery method to which the customer participates also actively is the best in Teams application projects. This project also confirmed us that Teams suits well for enabling back office work.Now, the handlers from different city services can start to process the ideas and initiatives using the Teams application and see straight away the information and statuses of the ideas, comment them and process them in Teams. Power BI reports enabler the up-to-date statistics and overview of the handling process. The status and comments of the ideas are transferred back to the submitter through an interface. Therefore, the Teams application has speeded up and streamlined the overall handling process. It has decreased the risks where the assigned ideas are not processed by the handlers. Eventually, thanks to a new idea handling back office solution, the city of Helsinki can now make more use of the employees’ ideas due to the time saved in the handling process.Microsoft Teams is a versatile collaboration platform which can help the organization to modernize its internal processes. During this spring, it has been proven that Teams enables a seamless collaboration and working from home. Naturally, we have now seen the growing interest towards leveraging the usage of Teams with the applications and take the full power out of Teams apps and Office 365 services.Got you interested? We are here for you!Are you interested in figuring out how to get to a next level with Teams? We have an approach to help you to investigate and ideate the possibilities for Teams applications.

Public-private partnership in cybersecurity: A relationship of love or convenience?,/en/blog/2020/06/public-private-partnership-in-cybersecurity-a-relationship-of-love-or-convenience/,Cybersecurity insights / Jari Pirhonen / 5.6.2020,"For the citizen, this primarily means having or acquiring basic cybersecurity awareness and skills, in some cases also basic tools. And using these skills when buying and using software, network connected devices and digital services.For companies and organizations, this means something much more. In this category of ‘much more’ we need to consider broad based cooperation which transcends the boundaries of organizations, and indeed the public and private sectors.Public private partnership (PPP) in cybersecurity is, in a way, nothing new. This has been a topic within the security industry and community for at least a decade; in the Nordics, we are quite well accustomed to companies working with authorities for the common good. However, with digitalization spreading perhaps even faster than originally envisioned, there is the need to revisit the basics of PPP in cybersecurity.The relationship between private and public sectors in things cybersecurity is a complicated one. On the one hand, it is clear that both need each other in this world becoming increasingly digital. On the other hand, relationship is complicated by the different threat perceptions and landscapes.Summarizing the key differences; the public sector is about producing services for the citizens stipulated in and guided by regulations; while companies focus on offering services based on business priorities. To companies, regulation tends to equal costs. The thing is, the majority of the society’s critical infrastructure rests upon a foundation laid by private companies. Thus, during crises, both parties are dependent on each other.A relationship of convenience, then? The digital world is increasingly intertwined. As the current pandemic has demonstrated, along with regulations such as NIS and GDPR, there is an increasing need to work together to build the trust of the citizen and the consumer into things and channels digital.The areas that cybersecurity PPP cooperation typically covers are related to regulations, crisis exercises and exchange of information. A brief look at these below.Regulation. Lawmakers draft legislation, also that pertaining to cybersecurity. Companies would need to be involved in the formulating of cybersecurity related regulations, so that they are pertinent to real life. This company involvement should adopt a shift left approach; that companies, instead or reviewing drafts already composed, are involved for the beginning to provide their input.Training. Cybersecurity cooperation takes place through crisis exercise programs and sessions involving both sectors. This provides concrete insights and experiences into the roles of the respective sectors, even down to individual organizations and companies, in times of crisis, to secure critical cybersecurity areas. TietoEVRY is very much involved in these types of activities across the Nordic countries.Exchange of information. The smooth and regular exchange of information on cybersecurity (threat landscape, technological evolutions) is one cornerstone of cybersecurity PPP. Often a government organization takes the lead, inviting into a ‘Cybergroup’ representatives of critical cybersecurity agencies, organizations and companies to pool their expertise and resources. In many cases, there are also other organizations which play an active role in driving and coordinating cybersecurity PPP.PPP is especially important in security critical infrastructure of societies. Technology and digitalization are a very important element of keeping the wheels of society and commerce turning. PPP plays an increasing important role in this.The relationship between the public and private sectors in the realm of cybersecurity is complicated; but useful.

"""We need to change a bit to make the most of this new normal.""",/en/blog/2020/06/more-people-will-work-from-home-and-downtown-office-hubs.-we-will-be-more-present-in-our-lives.-but-there-is-a-catch/,Meet our people / Trond Vinje / 4.6.2020,"NEW WAYS OF WORKING: Cooperating remotely in an efficient way with our coworkers requires us to set even clearer expectations and give more direct feedback, the HR Manager Trond Vinje explains.We entered the “new normal” only two or three months ago, yet many of us have quickly established new routines in the world of a remote office, constant handwashing, eating in and video conferences.But what will be the long term consequences of you and I implementing new behaviours in our everyday private and professional lives?“We need to change a bit to make the most of this new normal. On the one hand, the new normal is providing us with more time which allows us to be more present in our lives. A recent survey for employees at TietoEVRY also shows that most of our colleagues are experiencing a greater level of productivity”, says Trond Vinje, Executive Vice President for Human Resources at TietoEVRY.On the other hand, a remote office might not be the best solution for everyone.  “This is something that employers should be aware of, and facilitating for different needs”, he elaborates.Boost your knowledge in just 15 minutes! We know you’re busy, so we’ve come up with a new vlog series on concrete actions that you can use today and in the long term, all presented in short and neat episodes of 15 minutes.Trond points to the fact that every person’s needs are different when it comes to motivation and drive. Social needs might play an important role in your performance – informal discussions might be important for your motivation and ways to proceed with tasks.“We have fewer points of contact in our everyday lives now. When you don’t sit in the same office space as your colleagues, one might feel like needing to have an agenda to be able to pick up the phone and call them,” he elaborates.A great level of trust is neededCooperating remotely in an efficient way with our coworkers requires us to set even clearer expectations and give more direct feedback, the HR Manager explains.We need to set clearer goals and expectations and provide more direct feedback to each other. This new way of working is demanding a great level of trust, and leaders may even have to adapt their personal leadership style, and that inevitably involves nurturing a high-trust culture and building a connection with colleagues even if you are physically far apart.“A great level of trust is needed,” Trond says.Nick Vertigans of the Nordic Leadership Network, a non-profit that aids leaders in their development, agrees that trust is the vital ingredient in effective teams.“The key predictor of performance is the quality of a relationship with a team member. And that begins with trust. Leaders must take the time to find out how people are as opposed to launching into a project update,” Nick says.“The best leaders are calling their key people and asking one simple question: ''How are you doing?” And they’re going to listen and say nothing for five minutes.”More office hubs and remote workA recent survey by YouGov for TietoEVRY shows that nearly half of all workers in Sweden have worked more from home to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Encouragingly, of those who do work from home, as many as 78 percent believe that their organization has the know-how and digital tools required for effective remote working.The majority also believe their managers have the capabilities to work digitally.The results of the survey from Finland shows that remote work does not reduce work efficiency: close to one-third of Finns have worked remotely in recent weeks in accordance with pandemic recommendations, and 14 percent said they have switched to remote work altogether. 46 percent said they work even more efficiently remotely or not feel that remote work affected their efficiency in a negative way. 38 percent could not say about the effects of remote work on their work.Among Norwegians, the survey shows that one in four is positive about working remotely from home and over a third of the respondents believe they will be working more outside of the office even after offices are opened and returning to business as usual.In the immediate future, Trond thinks more companies will keep a higher level of remote work and establish workspace hubs in addition to their offices.Recently, the giant technology company Facebook declared that within a decade as many as half of the company’s more than 48,000 employees would work from home.TietoEVRY is also considering new solutions for more remote work and office hubs. “This will enable greater flexibility, closeness to customers and less corporate travel,” Trond explains.As difficult as COVID-19 has been for so many people and businesses, he is hopeful that COVID-19 will have many positive effects in terms of work-life balance. Moreover, any long-lasting sustainable behaviours are, of course, also welcome as the world looks to slow down and mitigate the effects of climate change.And not to mention the increased solutions across public and health services: digitalization is escalating, resulting in greater dialogue with citizens.“Flexibility is a deal of trust that also requires something from both the employer and the employee. It’s a good thing to be able to pick up the children earlier from kindergarten or making dinner earlier. At the same time you then need to be able to work longer hours other days or pick up the laptop in the evening to add a few more hours to your workday, but overall I see an increased activity level – at least for our company,” says Trond.", Trond Vinje ,Meet our people , 4.6.2020
TietoEVRY's corona epidemic prediction accuracy is top notch,/en/blog/2020/06/tietoevrys-corona-epidemic-prediction-accuracy-is-top-notch/,Digitalization / Tapio Pitkäranta / 4.6.2020,"When the Finnish government decided on exceptional circumstances in March, TietoEVRY's advanced healthcare cloud analysis team began to develop scenarios on the subject. The aim was to make a realistic forecast of the duration of the epidemic and the number of infections.Now, more than two months have passed since the scenarios prepared in March were created, it is a good time to compare the different scenarios and reality that has unfolded. In Finland, the corona epidemic has developed and been contained more positively than expected.The following time scales are included in the table:The three forecasts prepared at the end of March by TietoEVRY and made available to the company's own and cloud analytics customers (1.4. onwards)
Three estimates of current infections in Finland: 2x (“Lower limit”), 5x (“Intermediate”) and 10x (“Upper limit”) based on the number of detected infections

At present, it is not known exactly what the actual infection number is, but it has been estimated that the infection number (FI) would be about 2-10 times the number of confirmed infections.


The three scenarios defined in the memorandum guiding the Finnish Government's decision on exceptional circumstances created 16 March 2020 (FI) and the two scenarios outlined in the memorandum and informing the decision made on 25 March 2020 (FI) on the closure of Uusimaa.These projections include the effects of emergency slowdown measures. In the table, we see how the predictions determined by TietoEVRY's logarithmic scale follow quite closely the current estimates of the total number of infections.How accurate were the forecasts?It has been said that making an accurate prediction is simple, but not easy; achieving good forecast accuracy is rarely based on a superior forecast model.Therefore, to manage uncertainty and to understand the phenomenon, it is essential to understand exactly what assumptions are being entered into the model and if these need to be changed during the forecast period. It is often the case that poor forecast accuracy can be attributed to inaccurate assumptions being entered into the model at the early stages and not accounting for changes over the course of the forecast period.When analyzing the forecasting errors in the forecast models used in the Finnish government’s memorandum, it has been noted that these are not due to the epidemic models themselves, which were updated at different points during the spring, but precisely because of the assumptions themselves. In practice, people’s behaviour changed more than the scenarios had assumed which accounts for the discrepancy between predicted and detected infections.Numerous ready-made models for modelling epidemics already exist and we can even speak of model libraries. For those without extensive experience in epidemiology or education in epidemic modelling, it would be questionable to try and develop a new way to model the epidemic itself.For the first modelling of the epidemic, TietoEVRY followed the well-known SEIR model based on fairly simple differential equations. Because the model includes an interest-to-interest type exponential function, it must be carefully assessed whether the assumptions of that basic reproduction number last for the duration of the simulation period. At the same time, the co-efficients of the differential equation are no longer constant.Do the assumptions last?The determining factor in predicting accuracy in this case was not the use of the SEIR model over another model, but whether the parameters of the model used were applicable and realistic over time. To achieve high prediction accuracy, the most important element is to describe the assumptions correctly, that is, to predict the parameters of the model over time.In practical epidemic situations, accuracy is determined by correctly predicting the infection rate over time. A change in infection rate can be attributed to a combination of many things, including the impact of policy measures and changes in people’s behaviour. Data from both of these measures was available through both scientific publications and a variety of data sources – from service mobile service provider data reports to individual laboratory results. The accuracy of the forecast was determined by how well the most reliable estimates of the infection rate could be derived from different data sources and accounted for in the Finnish epidemic model.Government forecasts assumed that over a period of 100 days, people would reduce their social contacts by a third or a quarter. TietoEVRY used a more multi-dimensional analysis to determine the infection rate and this is the reason why good predictive accuracy was achieved. This proves that the most complex model or assumptions are not essential and is backed up by Occam's razor theory which recommends choosing the simplest of two theories to explain a phenomenon.Even in situations where in-depth mathematics underpins an approach, it is worth trying to describe through simple assumptions, a way to manage uncertainty over a period of time. When the assumptions made can be described as detached and comprehensible entities, it is easy to discuss the uncertainties of the outcome with clarity and science, not mysticism.Read more about our healthcare and welfare solutions and services", Tapio Pitkäranta ,Digitalization , 4.6.2020
From quick wins to strategic automation – how process mining can elevate your automation efforts,/en/blog/2020/06/from-quick-wins-to-strategic-automation--how-process-mining-can-elevate-your-automation-efforts/,Cloud / Mukesh  Israni / 2.6.2020,"Having robots handle redundant and/or repetitive tasks can be a significant source for speed and cost-efficiency in any organization. Use cases span from payroll processing to transferring data between applications and handling incoming customer orders.However, automation can have a much more profound impact on a company’s inner workings and business processes, when paired with process mining. This approach is still not mainstream in the automation world, even though Gartner named hyperautomation first of its strategic technology trends for 2020.In this article, we compare two alternative approaches to automation: going after the quick wins versus seeking strategic benefits by combining RPA with process mining. We will discuss the following themes and share a bunch of real-life examples to illustrate our points:Setting goals for RPA
Finding automation potential
Assessing automation success
Engaging the organizationWe will also briefly consider how an upcoming SAP S/4HANA transformation might affect automation initiatives.Setting the goals: making single tasks run smoother vs. gaining a strategic benefit with RPACompanies only beginning to automate often view the organization as separate buckets. They might ask, for example, what could be done to streamline their bookkeepers’ work or reduce redundancies in customer service.What these companies have in common, is that their primary goal for automation is to save time and resources within single departments or functions.As a result, pieces of the process are improved depending on the ownership, leadership and ambition of the people involved, but the remaining part of the process remains the same. Ultimately the net effect may not be substantial with the bottlenecks having moved to other parts of the process.This is quite natural, too, because most of us are unaware as to what organizational processes actually look like, and what is happening before or after our own work input.While doing lots of small things can add up to a lot, it is unlikely that this approach will allow you to leverage automation to the fullest. Companies focusing on making single tasks run smoother are blindsided by the fact that automation can do a lot more than just save costs.We argue that bigger goals can, and should, be set. In our work we’ve seen that the companies who set their sight on the big goal generally do the best. The key is looking at the organization as a whole and aiming to understand end-to-end processes.Quick wins: Aim to make work more efficient within silos.Strategic automation: Aim for smoother end-to-end processes to gain competitive advantage.Finding automation potential: focusing on most pressing problems vs. taking an analytic approach with process miningWhen it comes to identifying automation potential and prioritizing those tasks, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the different possibilities. One particular pitfall to look out for is having numbers trump real impact.Heading over to certain departments, such as finance or HR, is so tempting because of the sheer volume of tasks they perform each day. But focusing on whoever shouts the loudest may not yield the best results, like we’ve explained before.How does one, then, see the forest for the trees and set their eyes on the automation tasks with real business impact?We’ve found process mining to be of great help when striving for a more analytic approach. People often imagine their processes to be swifter and more straight-forward than they actually are. Looking at the process through actual event logs can reveal a whole different reality.We’ve made use of process mining in several customer cases and have seen the wonders it can work. In terms of automation, it is the hidden inefficiencies and deviations that are most interesting to look at.To take an example, one of our customers had a problem in the accounts payable space. They were commonly paying invoices after the due date, which was adding up to significant losses in the form of penalty fees and lost discounts.When analyzing the problem with process mining software, we found that payments would get stuck in the system due to incorrect or missing data in the original invoices, such as missing contract data or unmaintained tax codes, often characterized by dependencies with other departments.As a solution, we integrated a software bot with the process mining model to fill in the required information. Based on real-time data, the robot was able to identify similar cases from the past and propose corrective actions, prioritize work, and even start automated workflows in the background, ultimately speeding up the handling of the invoices.It’s possible, or even likely, that just by approaching this problem tactically, it would have been left unfixed. The root cause was not the bookkeepers paying the invoices late, but the process being held back at other parts of the organization.Quick wins: Automate most pressing or numerous tasks.Strategic benefit: Analyse end-to-end process to solve challenges with highest meaningful impact.Measuring success: looking for cost savings vs. improving customer satisfactionHow to tell you’ve succeeded in your automation efforts?It should be clear by now that optimizing and automating processes doesn’t have to be just about reducing costs. The final goal could be, for instance, improving customer experience, or reducing shipping time.Let’s illustrate this with a real-life example: A retailer serving both B2C and B2B segments had a problem with customer experience. One of their largest customers was complaining about not getting their orders in time, which triggered an investigation to fix the problem.It turned out that the delivery block was caused by problems in the master data. By fixing those, we were able to improve both customer satisfaction and the company’s working capital. The sooner they were able to invoice to the customer, the faster they were able to  get their money into the bank.One of the benefits of a data-driven approach is that you can also tell when you’ve taken steps in the right direction. Once the actual process starts to resemble the ideal process more, and key metrics go in the desired direction, you’ll know that your work has had an actual impact.(It should be noted that oftentimes the lack of good data is the reason that so many companies are still lagging behind on automation, and should be the first place to start.)Quick wins: Look for cost-efficiency or any other single parameter.Strategic automation: Look for complex yet meaningful gains, such as customer value.Engaging the organization: seeking automation maturity vs. building automation capabilitiesWhen adding process mining and automation to an organization’s tech stack, certain departments stand out as logical first steps.Take finance, for instance. It is time-critical, and every action usually ends up in your books. For these reasons, people in these roles are usually very diligent about their process, and thus finding automation potential can be rather easy.On the other hand, when it comes to many other functions within an organization, processes may be only loosely followed, not very well tracked, or kept up to date, or perhaps missing completely.If paper slips are still exchanged as part of the process, automation initiatives may come to a sudden halt.It is likely, however, that most value lies in automating these very areas. Although it’s easier to begin your automation initiative within more process-oriented functions such as finance and HR, you should eventually strive to move on towards trickier disciplines – or best of all, forget silos altogether!However, getting the whole organization on board is likely no walkover. People are naturally quite change-averse, and pushing solutions from the outside (or IT) can be tricky. Building automation capabilities takes its time because it requires a change in how people work.Imagine a part of your work was automated. You would no longer need to do a given task, but you would still be responsible for the results. Often this raises a bunch of questions: Has the task been done okay? Should I be checking it? What exactly is my role now?Automating business processes shifts our role from doing something to looking at the output. It requires a certain level of trust between the human and digital counterparts.If your organization has little or no experience with automation, a good outcome for first automation projects could be building trust in the collaborative way of working. Once more automation readiness is built, it is easier to spread this way of thinking throughout the organization.Quick wins: Focus on functions that have good automation maturity.Strategic automation: Build automation capabilities and trust in the entire organization.Facing an S/4HANA migration soon? Here’s how your automation euros won’t go to wasteTo end things off, what if there’s a larger business transformation on the horizon, such as an S/4HANA migration?A technological upheaval as large as an ERP transition – such as the S/4HANA migration – can raise questions in terms of other digitization initiatives. Our customers often ask us what will happen to their existing automation efforts, and whether it makes sense to start new ones before such changes.From where we stand, we see doing automation prior to an ERP transition as a prioritization issue. Automation projects should be assessed depending on their usefulness after the migration and their usefulness to the migration itself.Read more: Work with us to move seamlessly to SAP's latest ERP system and get the best installation for your businessChanges to the underlying system always pose a risk that the robot would only work partially after, or worst case scenario, be rendered completely useless. The bare minimum would be changing the application screens.When done right, process mining and automation can help you make a smoother transition to a new ERP, be it S/4HANA or something else. Having data transferred between the old and the new system with the help of robotic process automation (RPA) can be a real game-changer.Deciding which projects to push forward and which ones to stall is easier when you have a trusted advisor to turn to. A responsible automation partner should also be able to say when it makes sense to put euros into automation, and when not to.

Six steps towards achieving a healthy work–life balance,/en/blog/2020/05/six-steps-towards-achieving-a-healthy-worklife-balance/,Meet our people / Katrine  Skrede / 28.5.2020,"Katrine has worked in hospital, municipal and research environments. Katrine Skrede is now a project manager in TietoEvry, working on projects in e-health and digitalization of the health sector.Photo: Katrine with her dog SagaWhen she decided to make the transition from health to technology, she had several options. Her physiotherapy training, master's degree in public health science from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences and experience in welfare technology made Katrine an attractive candidate for several large companies.When she had to choose one of them as her new employer, she picked TietoEvry. IT and health will increasingly go hand in hand, and this is where Katrine believes she has a lot of offer.- I feel I'm in the right place and hope I can bring new perspectives to the table, given my background as a health professional. I think the culture here seems more caring and genuine, and I like the focus on having a good work-life balance. That was decisive, in many ways, says Katrine.Working hard and having a life outside of work doesn't have to be incompatible, according to Katrine.- I choose a job I enjoy and that interests me. I sometimes work extra hours, but I think leading a meaningful life outside of work is important for relaxing and recuperating so that I can perform my best at work, says Katrine.Good balance is the most importantKatrine's expectations reflect the annual Universum report, in which hundreds of IT students answer questions about what makes a workplace attractive. For more than 10 years now, the work-life balance has been ranked top of their wish list.In 2008, 58 percent of the students responded that this was the key factor when evaluating employers.Why has personal life become such an important issue for job seekers?Award-winning speaker and author Annika Malmberg Hamilton believes it's because young people today are much more aware of the risks of stress and of how dangerous it can be to burn out.- When I was young, I'd never even heard the word 'burned out'. I had no idea that working too much could harm my health. Working a lot is not in itself dangerous; the tricky bit is when you work a lot without setting time aside to recuperate. Working on something you don't enjoy can also drain your energy, says Annika.", Katrine  Skrede ,Meet our people , 28.5.2020
Blockchain shaping the Automotive industry,/en/blog/2020/05/blockchain-technology-meets-automotive-industry/,Data / Tietoevry at your service / 28.5.2020,"You may have heard about blockchain technology and how it has become an important gamchanger for many. Blockchain has begun to change the entire automotive industry and digital advantages wait for those in the industry who see it and start to adapt to the technology.

To get to the bottom of this, we interviewed our very own experts, Business Designer Tomas Roaldsnes and Janko Lind, Vice President for Industries in Sweden.
A technology both ethical and moral
According to Tomas, blockchain is a technology that is both ethical and moral. As he sees it, technology in general changes the way we trust each other, so many industries would benefit from adopting to this technology.
""Blockchain is the technology that distributes databases. You could say that Google Docs was the first blockchain technology, simply because in a Google Docs document all invited parties can open, add, edit and even delete text. Any changes made by individuals can be saved until the document is deleted, at which point all traces and data are also deleted, which is brilliant,"" says Tomas, and adds: ""But of course it's important to keep in mind that blockchain meets just one specific need; it can’t save the world from all disasters.""
Blockchain and automotive- a great match
Blockchain may not be able to bring peace on earth, but it can most definitely change the future for lots of industries. Those who chose to adapt to the technology may also be the disruptors who lead the industry to a greater future. According to Janko Lind the automotive industry is one of those who have lots to gain to embrace the possibilities. Janko has worked forTietoEvry for almost 15 years. He is a true enthusiast of the automotive industry to the extent that he in his spare time runs a car his own YouTube channel connecting with other car enthusiasts. He truly believes that blockchain is the technology that can take the car to the next level.
Carsharing made trustworthy with blockchain
""If we look back just a couple of years, we can see that a lot has happened when it comes to car ownerships. The car has gone from being restricted to its owner to become more of a marketplace due to the amazing technology of blockchain.
This means that we can share the concept of being mobile with others and make everyday life more efficient. The person who lets someone else unlock his or her car can do it without worrying about being exploited, and all this thanks to blockchain technology,"" says Janko, and adds:
""Let’s say you park your car and no longer need to use it for a while. Instead of just taking up a parking space you can rent it out to someone else in need of a car in your area. However, you want control over who has access to it. Now you can, by setting up a smart contract using blockchain technology that allows you to set the rules. For example, that the driver must have held a driving licence for 10 years or that the car may not leave the city or another area of your choice. The contract is then distributed to a lending pool, which provides the right individual, who needs to accept your terms and conditions before they can hire your car.""
Important to allow freedom under secure conditions
The automotive industry has taken a turn where old technology has been replaced by smart technology, easily controlled by the smartphone. This has made mobility more efficient and according to Janko, the car industry needs to rethink and start addressing the users and their needs. Janko is convinced that blockchain can help the car regain its status as a symbol of freedom:

""At TietoEvry we have an excellent platform for making transactions secure. Carpooling is not just about having a car available but also about making sure it works – and that's where we come in.""

Blockchain makes it possible for the car industry to rapidly set up digital contracts between partners. Here at TietoEvry, Project Snowflake is a blockchain option that we provide for securely gathering all personal data into one single location and can be used effectively when renting a car.", Tietoevry at your service ,Data , 28.5.2020
Friendly AI for the future,/en/blog/2020/05/friendly-ai-for-the-future/,Data / Tietoevry at your service / 28.5.2020,"A few weeks ago I attended a big event arranged by one of our partners. My colleagues and I were focused on gaining a better understanding of how business analysts, BI developments and data scientist could work together on creating advanced analysis and machine learning solutions. But there was another issue that couldn't be avoided, one that cropped up in every discussion, if only on a more general level. I'm referring to the difference between AI and AI. And yes, there are two types: the one we use today and the one that belongs in a distant future. Since then, I've been asking myself the same questions over and over: how can large companies like ours discuss AI in the same language as our customers? How can we reach consensus and strike a balance between expectations and reality?What we do have: narrow artificial intelligence (NAI)I thought I could start off with the type of AI that actually exists today, the one which is popularly known as AI but which actually should go by its proper name: narrow artificial intelligence (NAI). This type of AI is data driven, and is developed to resolve specific tasks with a view to removing humans from the equation. NAI can be applied in an infinite number of areas: everything from process automation to minimising or excluding the need for manual input from humans or creating smart assistants. The change occurs with the help of the data-driven methodology that enables NAI, drawing on the potential that lies in underlying data concerning the task to be resolved. We simply let our models replicate human abilities and perform the work by feeding them examples of how we want them to act until we are satisfied with their performance.Saying that you worked on AI got you ridiculed at a cocktail party [under AI vintern på 80- och 90-talet]. Today you don’t get invited to a party unless you work on AI. – Oliver Schabenberger.What we don't have: artificial general intelligence (AGI), which both thinks and acts autonomouslyThe AI that exists in reality is the narrow type I mentioned above. It differs distinctly from the type of AI that is considered all over the world to be a potential threat to humanity, namely artificial general intelligence (AGI) or general AI. Unlike NAI, which adapts algorithms to data with no 'mind', AGI is a type of AI which not only is capable of learning how to resolve a specific task – it is also capable of doing everything we humans can do; AI that can think and act autonomously. Or to put it another way: think Terminator and Westworld.Avoid misunderstandingsWhen AI terminology is left unchecked and used to describe everything from highly technical and impressive solutions to simple implementations of basic ""if this, then that"" logic, there are bound to be problems. Especially for those of us who are expected to deliver advanced analytical solutions to our customers. The fact that AI ≠ AI means that expectations of what AI is capable of do not always match reality. But there is a way of avoiding the problem. First, we should all express ourselves clearly and use the term narrow AI when we want to refer to the type of data-driven solutions which, with the help of analysis and models, simplify everyday life. The general public may not be very impressed, but at least we can assure everyone who thinks that we might accidentally create something which will pave the way for future world domination by robots; as already clarified, we can leave that to AGI. We need to clear up misconceptions and reach consensus, both with our customers and with society at large, in order to keep discussions on the right level. As you may have noticed, AI and related subjects happen to be among my favourite topics of discussion./Niklas Andersson, AI fan, BI consultant and data scientist in TietoEvry", Tietoevry at your service ,Data , 28.5.2020
We invented a new banking concept,/en/blog/2020/05/interns-invented-a-new-banking-concept/,Meet our people / Tietoevry at your service / 28.5.2020,"Veronika, Pedram and Morten travelled around Oslo with iPads and surveys and came up with a brilliant and innovative banking concept. That's pretty much a summary of what happened when three of our interns were given an assignment consisting of two sentences, free reigns and four months to complete the task. The long story is well worth hearing about though.Veronika Hamarova has been an intern and worked closely with Pedram Mireftekhari and Morten Stien since early September.""We've have worked, discussed and eaten lunch together every day since September. I'm actually surprised that we haven't got fed up with each other,"" says Veronika, laughing. Along with Pedram and Morten, Veronika has been an intern at TietoEvry (former Evry) since early September 2018. Together they came up with four concepts for how to improve online banking, including a loyalty programme in the app.An internship with us involves working on a long-term project as part of a team. The projects originate in dialogue with our customers and are based on real-life problems. They run over a four-month period, during which the interns are paid. Their assignments range from developing apps or researching a new concept to finding out how new technology can be applied to solve a problem.A closely-knit team: Pedram, Morten and Angelika.A bank-challenge and a half.For four months, Pedram, Morten and Veronika worked intensively for Sparebank 1 Østlandet. It started with the bank assigning the team the following challenge formulated in two sentences:""How can we enhance customer loyalty to our bank, particularly among our young customers? We want you to challenge us on everything!""The whole autumn was spent on developing a concept. The trio spent a lot of time collecting data so that they could gain a better understanding of the user group. One of the methods they used was to trawl downtown Oslo armed with iPads and asked people in the street to answer surveys.""We went everywhere: to BI Norwegian Business School, the University of Oslo, libraries, hairdressers – even opticians. It was important for us to get a broad sample of answers on what people wanted from their mobile bank app. Distributing the survey online would not have been much use; we had to get out of the office and actually talk to people,"" Pedram explains.After four hectic months the trio presented a brand new banking concept – and were offered permanent positions in TietoEvry. Along with in-depth interviews, the 200 or so responses resulted in four different concepts for mobile banking, such as a separate loyalty programme for bank customers, and ideas for new saving functions. Once this was done, they went back on the streets to test prototypes for their concepts.""Pedram actually became very good at using the Marvelapp programme, which can be used to create prototypes of apps. We received better answers from bank users in the second round because we had something tangible to show them. But we would not have arrived at the concept unless we had taken the time to collect input early on,"" says Veronika.Christian Fjestad, Head of Innovation SpareBank1 Østlandet:
— Our experience of last autumn's TietoEvrys (former Evrys) Innovation Hub project is very positive. The interns showed a keen interest in our creative challenge, and their presentation held a high standard. The project provided our bank with valuable insight, and we will be addressing several of the elements they presented to us.Offered permanent jobsPedram, Morten and Veronika all studied economics. Morten is currently writing this master's thesis, while the other two have accepted permanent positions with us.""What attracted me to apply for an internship in TietoEvry was the advertisement said about innovation,"" says Morten.""And research,"" adds Veronika.What gave them most satisfaction was that fact that they could work on innovation and concept development without having to know how to code.""I think a lot of people out there want to work on technology and want to change society, but maybe feel they lack the tech background. As it turned out, being tech-literate was enough,"" says Pedram.Collaboration – and sometimes post-its – made the magic happen.We like to set up teams comprised of people with different backgrounds, and that goes for our interns, too. Pedram comes from Iran, Veronika from Slovakia and Morten was born and raised in Bergen. Having such diverse backgrounds has proved valuable when they had to find out how the mobile bank could be innovated.""We come from different countries and use different banks. Those factors have enriched our discussions because our mobile banks have different features which we can compare,"" says Veronika.The tolerance level in the team was high. They had many discussions which they say drove them forward in the conceptual process, and they decided early on that everyone could agree to disagree. They also went through what Morten describes as an extremely long brainstorming process.""Believe it or not, many of my best ideas came to me in the shower. Your thoughts tend to wander while you stand there, and suddenly you get a smart idea. Then it's a matter of jumping out of the shower, grabbing your mobile phone and sharing the idea with the others on Slack,"" he says.", Tietoevry at your service ,Meet our people , 28.5.2020
Acceptance of gaming in CVs,/en/blog/2020/05/acceptance-of-gaming-in-cvs/,/ Tietoevry at your service / 28.5.2020,"Åshild has read over 800 applications, and thinks people should add gaming to their CV - as long as they have it as a genuine interest.Max, Åshild and Masoom all think there should be more openness about gaming.- If it's natural to write in an application about what qualities you acquired through a professional sport like handball, it will also be relevant to include gaming, if it's done at professional level, says Åshild Marie Tveit Walseth, who heads our internship programme and has read over 800 CVs.Like the Minister of Digitalisation, Åshild thinks it very positive to add gaming to your CV as long as you have it as a genuine interest.Gamers should stand up and be countedJob applicants themselves think there should be more openness about gaming so that they can add it to their CVs without the risk of being seen as lonely geeks.- Especially in the type of work interns do for us, I attach weight to candidates' ability to see the transfer value of their own skills, because I call in candidates from many different backgrounds, including less conventional ones. For me it's important that they're aware of this but also that they have the courage to stand up and be counted.Only a few years back gaming was more negatively looked upon than it is now.- I'm happy to see that there's more openness and acceptance for gaming as a learning arena. Many used to regard it as something negative and didn't dare admit that they actually did it professionally.In an article on Digi.no, Åshild and Minister of Digitalisation Nikolai Astrup describe personal qualities people have use for in gaming that can be transferred to working life.- I think video games can have huge learning value and lots of good qualities to teach, such as problem-solving, the ability to multitask, the ability to see the overall picture, leadership and project management, the ability to acquire new knowledge and English-language skills, says Åshild.Max, Åshild and Masoom show how much fun gaming can be.Even more openness neededSince the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation published Mats Steen's story, many seem to have gained a new and more positive view of gaming. Masoom and Max work in TietoEvry as a developer and junior consultant. Both of them game at relatively high levels.Max van Dun had named gaming as one of his hobbies on his CV, but was unsure of whether or not he ought to mention it at all.- I wasn't sure whether I should mention it at all, since gaming is not always looked on positively.Max says he wished there could be more openness around gaming so that in future he could feel proud of writing it on his CV.- If you ask me personally, gaming is exclusively positive. I've brought many experiences from gaming into my work life. The gaming industry has grown dramatically in recent years, and playing computer games has become more usual. That's why I think we should no longer be afraid to write it on our CVs.Masoom Mahan had also named gaming as one of his hobbies in his CV. Although he didn't focus on it more than that, he believes it was relevant for the job.- The reason it's on my CV is that I spend a good deal of time on gaming outside work. And it was one of the reasons I became interested in programming and decided to become a developer.'Both Masoom and Max know what Åshild means when she talks about transfer value from gaming to work. They have acquired many qualities which they have use for every day at work, such as motivation, creativity, planning and cooperation.- All these qualities are ones most people use positively every day at work, regardless of what their job is. So I think there are many more employers out there who need to look up and see the value of gaming rather than take the negative view that used to be emphasized, says Åshild.", Tietoevry at your service ,, 28.5.2020
Graduate program alumnis shape the future,/en/blog/2020/05/sindhusha-katriina-and-thea-shape-the-future/,Meet our people / Tietoevry at your service / 28.5.2020,"Every year we recruit graduates and trainees who learn about different aspects of IT. During the year they get the chance to both share and gain valuable knowledge. We sat down with Sindhusha, Katriina and Thea – who started out as Graduates – and asked them to tell us a little about themselves.Could you tell us a little about your background? Have you always been interested in IT?K: Back home in Finland I studied to become a material engineer, and moved to Sweden to take a master's degree in industrial management and innovation to supplement my education. I've always been interested in technology and entrepreneurship in the textile industry. I love discovering and learning about new things and transferring knowledge and learning from one field that I can apply in a completely different context.S: I earned my master's degree in data science at Blekinge Institute of Technology. Data science has always been the natural choice for me, and my interest in technology and IT goes as far back as I can remember. After I took my exam I began working in a startup, where I did all sorts of things, which is usual in startups. It was a cool job and I enjoyed it, but there came a point when I felt the need for something new and more challenging, so I moved back to Stockholm and looked for a graduate program that matched my technical background. After meeting various people who'd been trainees or graduates at former EVRY, I decided it was the right place for me.T: My path to IT hasn't been straight, but I'm glad it led to me where I am today. After a year's sabbatical I decided to continue studying design, so I applied to a program called Interaction Design just three hours before the deadline expired. During the first class I realised that interaction design was not what I'd expected, but I really liked it. Gradually I began to realise how important it was to always involve users and stakeholders in the design process; it makes the service valuable. I spent 10 weeks as a trainee in NetRelations while writing my thesis, and in January they offered me a full-time position. And now I'm one of TietoEvry's (former EVRY's) graduates!What's the biggest challenge for IT companies in the near future?S: When I first moved here and began studying and working in IT, I noticed how few women actually worked in the IT industry. At home in India, where I come from, no gender is overrepresented in the different technology training programs. But here I got used to being the only woman in the room. It's really important to keep women interested in IT, and actually we still need to keep everyone -regardless of gender – interested in IT. Beginning to learn about IT should be as easy as it is to handle an iPhone.T: We must consider the fact that technology and its development already has a major impact on us, and with time it will increase. Considering this enormous impact, we must approach new technology in a more democratic way. For example, AI and its development are decisions that are made by those who create it – not something that is decided by those who are affected by the actual development. To have a voice on this issue I think it's really important to educate people so that they can gain some insights into it all. I also think we need to make people more aware about how technology can be applied in safe and responsible ways in order to achieve some kind of digital balance.K: I have to agree with the others; education is the key to keep generating interest in driving innovation forward for human beings. There are so many different areas you can work in to improve people's lives thanks to IT, but when most people think of IT they only think about the most obvious technical aspects, like coding. If I had not seen first hand the innovative side of IT, I would never have thought of it as an industry where I would end up.Imagine it's 2030; what would you want to have been part of?T: When I began learning about all the different possibilities technology can offer, it became important for me to apply it to improve people's lives. So I would like to have contributed to developing MedTech, which I believe has the potential to dramatically change people's lives for the better. It's not just the different technical parts of MedTech that fascinate me; it's also the actual partnership between technology and the users from a human perspective. It's also in an area that needs monitoring so that it doesn't cross a line. For example, AI can outperform doctors when it comes to diagnostics, but that doesn't necessarily mean it would best for humans to be diagnosed by an app with no human interaction whatsoever on the other side.K: Right now I don't have any ultimate goal; I'm interested in everything, which makes it hard to choose. Because I'm interested in different areas means that I can spread knowledge across different areas and help people make better decisions. But wherever I end up, sustainability is one concept I will bring to the table.S: Education is the key to a better life, there's no question about that. Apart from the fact that there are more children in India attending school than you might think, there are still children who do not. With the help of technology, we could give every child a good education, regardless of geographical location. I believe this will help us realise the digital world we all talk about and which all of us should be able to live in. Technology can even change the notions we have of conventional school, as my view is that self-education combined with guided group training is the right way to go.", Tietoevry at your service ,Meet our people , 28.5.2020

Here you will also find links to other content produced by our experts to dive deeper into the fascinating world of data.Master these data terms with our data glossary:APIs and API ManagementCitizen data science / Self-service analyticsCorporate performance management / Enterprise performance managementData and analytics platformData architectureData assetData catalogData ecosystemData governanceData lifecycle /data lineageData literacyData pipelineData-driven business transformationData-driven organizationDataOpsData strategyData vaultData warehouse automationEdge analyticsEnterprise content managementMaster data managementIndustry 4.0Predictive analyticsWhat is the difference?Data warehouse vs data lakeArtificial intelligence vs analyticsAPIs and API managementApplication programming interface (API) allows parties to exchange data or initiate transaction in a system/service. API is seen also as a contract between API provider and API consumers, where API consumers receive the service (data or transaction) as promised and documented. APIs enable faster development of new business services, improve efficiency, decrease costs related to integration landscape, and enable more agility and flexibility in the IT landscape.API Management platforms ensure centralized full lifecycle control and security of APIs.BLOG: Why APIs are important to your business?Why APIs are important to your business?Citizen data science / self-service analyticsCitizen data science means that a knowledge worker without formal expertise in statistics and analytics uses data and analytics independently to solve business problems. Citizen data science is enabled by modern analytics tools that can automate data preparation and modeling tasks and minimize coding in data science work.Self-service analytics is an approach to business analytics / business intelligence that enables business users to access data and build reports and analysis without heavy involvement from central analytics or IT team.By training users to understand data, establishing security controls and auditing measures to ensure the appropriate access to data, and providing curated datasets and intuitive and easy-to-use tools organizations can democratize the use of data across different end-user roles and skill levels.Self-service analytics transforms the way people are working with data at SAS Scandinavian AirlinesCorporate performance management / enterprise performance managementCorporate performance management (CPM), also called enterprise performance management (EPM) and business performance management, helps monitor and manage the business performance of an organization. CPM/EPM solutions are designed to streamline financial processes and provide integrated approach to activities such as budgeting, planning and forecasting; consolidation and financial close; and performance analysis.Data and analytics platformA modern, cloud-based data and analytics platform combines the traditionaltraditional reporting with modern analytics and data scientists' services. It provides a platform, for example, for data-based applications that use artificial intelligence.The platform can use all forms of data from within the organization, from partners, and from external parties. The data  can be processed almost in real time into various data products.The platform consists of public cloud services, typicallynative components from cloud providers and third-party tools available via cloud marketplaces. The services' license models and technical features are flexible, so the service's cost is calculated according to the usage. Moreover, the services can be sliced ​​for different user groups, which can be very useful: For example, running a heavy analytical process does not interfere with normal operational data processes. Thus, an annual process run doesn't require reserving resources for a whole year.Read more about cloud-based data and analytics platforms in a blog series:Data Lakes and Warehouses Part 1: Intro to Paradigms

Best practices: Time to Take a Grip of the Best Practices for Data Warehouse Modernization.Data architectureData architecture is a part of the overall enterprise architecture and can refer to several perspectives. It often relates to the artifacts of data architecture on multiple abstraction levels, such as data models, definitions, and descriptions of information flows and metadata.With the artifacts, a system project's data processing can be designed and implemented to support data reuse, quality, data security, and privacy, as well as to meet business requirements across functional silos.Data assetEntity that is comprised of data that companies use to generate value, such as revenues. Can be e.g., system, application output file, database, document, or web page.Data catalogA data catalog is an organized inventory of available data assets, combined with data management and search tools. Data catalogs use metadata to describe data assets and are designed to help data users to find the data they need for analytics or other business purpose.Data ecosystemA data ecosystem is an open or closed network with an interest in exchanging data between the actors of the network, following common rules: interfaces and data models. The members of an ecosystem have one thing in common: they all benefit from the data so much that it's worth sharing their data with the network. The exchange can also rely on monetary compensation.A data ecosystem shares a vision of enabling more diverse data and solutions than a single actor could achieve alone. An ecosystem can have an owner, in which case it is about the dominance and benefit of one actor. Alternatively, ecosystem ownership can be decentralized to the members, making all ecosystem actors equal.In some cases, a data ecosystem has a separate operator taking care of correspondence between actors and data transferring, without utilizing the data in its own operations.Being involved in a suitable data ecosystem or owning one can, at best, be a significant competitive advantage.Data governanceBasically, data governance is about data ownership. The owner of a company's business units, equipment, and properties manages the usage of the company's assets and strives to maximize its business benefits. This should also be the case with company-owned data sets.The owner of a data set is responsible for ensuring the data is of good quality and making sure the user rights comply with the set rules. Thus, corporate data governance should define the policies and tools for data owners and other users of data.Data governance includes the idea of enabling access and visibility into the data for as many employees as possible—across organizational units. Data access should only be restricted for good reasons, such as privacy.To comprehensively use the data and develop a data-driven business, the organization needs to have an existing and implemented data governance model. If the model does not exist yet, it's good to start from a data set that has the most business value and is prioritized by the organization's top management.Often, the quickest results happen when the starting point is an analytics development project that generates a significant business advantage.ICA: On a journey to make data governance a natural part of the businessData lifecycle / data lineageA data lifecycle refers to the different stages of data elements and data resources from the creation of information to its destruction. The stages can include storing, warehousing, transferring, using, and archiving the information. Like every other product’s lifecycle, data lifecycle needs to be managed. Successful organizations govern each stage of the data lifecycle by policies and practices to maximize data’s value.Due to data security and privacy requirements, it is important to set business requirements for the end of the data lifecycle as well. Those requirements can include rules, such as how long the information can/should be stored and why.Metadata management systems visualize the data transfers between various systems and describe how the data transforms from the source to its users. Data lineage refers to the visualization of the data lifecycle.Metadata management – the often-neglected discipline that can boost your successData literacyData literacy is a term used to describe an individual’s ability to read, understand, and utilize data in different ways. As the ability to work with data and use it for decision-making has been recognized as an essential skill for executives, managers, and employees alike, data literacy training programs are often included in organization-wide data and analytics initiatives.Data x Business report: Data literacy is becoming a basic skill for everyoneData pipelineA data pipeline is a controlled function for data processing and data product creation that brings business value. A data product can be, for example, a report or a prediction produced by a machine learning algorithm that’s used via an interface.The data pipeline includes and combines several components. The components cover data source reading, editing, analyzing, storing the data in different data models, and activating the data through the processed data product. The components are based on a micro-service model, which means that individual components may have different developers and life cycles.Data-driven business transformationA business transformation aims for fundamental changes in a business or its processes. A data-driven business transformation uses data and analytics to enable those changes.Now organizations either use little or no data in addition to traditional financial reporting or use it only in certain operations. The new data-driven way of thinking harnesses data to improve business, management, and service production processes across the organization.A data-driven business transformation means not only deploying the technology but also developing data availability, data quality, procedures, and a data-driven culture.UPM: Agile digital leaps towards more efficient data use in a global companyData-driven organizationA data-driven approach means that an organization makes decisions based on information. Being able to make data-driven decisions requires reliable and accessible data. Having the technology and systems is not enough—success takes people, and cultural changes. The data-driven approach creates new opportunities: if used correctly, your data will not only streamline your operations, but also improves results, gives you a competitive advantage, and creates new business opportunities.Data x Business report: In what direction are data-driven organizations developing right now?DataOpsDataOps (data operations) refers to an operating model that uses various personnel roles and technologies to manage data pipelines automatically, and to support data-driven business development.Companies understand the value of data better than before, but commercializing business data for judicious use requires collaboration between business processes and organizations. As it's important to be able to quickly produce value adding entities (data products) from business data, this collaboration requires a new kind of approach. The goal of DataOps is to meet that need.DataOps is actually an interdisciplinary team formed around a business problem that makes use of agile way of working, DevOps practices and automation to manage entire data supply chain from source to value. The team organizes the data, tools, code, and development environments while taking care of scalability, functionality, and changes in data pipelines. Following the principles of continuous delivery, the team strives to swiftly generate valuable information from source data to support business.Bring DataOps to life with the help of data warehouse automationData strategyA data strategy is a shared view on how data and analytics is used to achieve strategic business objectives. A good data strategy includes a strong vision and business reason, short-term and long-term objectives, defined roles and responsibilities, and metrics for success. Essentially, it aligns and prioritizes data and analytics activities with key organizational priorities and goals and works as a tool in a communication between business, IT, and data organization.Tips from Chief Data Officers: create a data use case and put the backbone in placeData vaultThe growth in data volumes, changes in source systems and demands to make data available for decision making in near real-time has created pressure for traditional data warehousing design methods such as Kimball and Inmon. Data Vault method is designed to improve agility and scalability in data modelling, especially in large scale enterprise data warehouses.The Data Vault paradigm embraces the idea that data models change and expand over time. The Data Vault model enables incremental changes and frequent updates to the data model. However, the modeling work needs to be done meticulously and correctly, making the process prone to human errors. Thus, a data warehouse automation tool is recommended to leverage the pros of a Data Vault.Read more about the benefits of the Data Vault paradigmData warehouse automationData warehouse automation (DWA) eliminates repetitive design, development, deployment, and operational tasks within the data warehouse lifecycle and thus accelerates the availability of analytics-ready data. Data warehouse automation solutions are integrated platforms that include design tools, development wizards, templates and visual interfaces. Following efficient design patterns instead of custom development improves speed and quality in data warehouse development and maintenance.DWA solutions enable to leverage the benefits of modern data modelling paradigms such as Data Vault and are used as a tool to create a shared understanding on the data model between data engineers and business users of data. Data warehouse automation is considered as a crucial ingredient in DataOps way of working.Edge analyticsEdge analytics is a model of data analysis that brings data analysis and processing to the location where the data is collected. Instead of sending data back to centralized data store, incoming data streams are automatically analyzed at a network edge, for example self-driving car, mobile phone or another connected device. Key benefit of edge analytics is speed. Edge eliminates latency and enables producing real-time analytics.Enterprise content managementEnterprise content management is an umbrella term for methods, tools and strategies that allows organization to capture, manage and deliver critical information of any format to its employees, stakeholders, and customers.Today, out of organizations’ information over 70% is unstructured and the definition of content range from paper documents such as invoices and contracts to emails, images, and video files. Content management solutions are set to automate and digitalize content-intensive processes, deliver relevant content to users when they need it, and ensure organizations to be legally compliant in managing their information.Master data managementMaster data represents the key data entities of a company, such as customers, suppliers, and products, and the relationships between these data domains. It is the data that is commonly used across business processes, organizational units, and between operational systems and reporting & analytics systems, and therefore should be managed in one place.Master data management refers to discipline and technologies used to coordinate master data across the enterprise. The need for master data management emerges from necessity for organizations to improve the consistency and quality of their core data assets.Ahlstrom-Munksjö: Good master data is essential for company managementPredictive analyticsMachine learning and statistical methods allow us to model future events based on previous data. Such modeling is called predictive analytics. Typical applications for predictive analytics can be, for example, customer attrition expectations, financial data predictions, and predicting machinery maintenance needs.Modeling that retrieves new information from a previous event is called predictive analytics. Sentiment analysis is a good example: that's when the feedback or the tone of a customer comment is assessed automatically. This enables an immediate reaction to negative feedback.Predictive analytics is usually distinguished from descriptive analytics. Instead of reporting the situation with available information, predictive analytics acquire new information.What is the difference?Data warehouse vs data lakeA data warehouse supports the organization's traditional core functions and obtains answers to defined questions from known source data. A data lake supports a more predictive and experimental approach.A data warehouse is mainly for structural information processing. A data lake enables the processing of all kinds of data in the organization. As the data warehouse and data lake are used for different purposes, they complement each other.A data lake is often used together with a data warehouse to store all the raw data, and only an applicable part of it is transmitted to the data warehouse. Recently, we've seen new solutions on the market that combine a data lake and a data warehouse. Such a hybrid solution doesn't have a well-established term yet.Read more in a blog series:Data Lakes and Warehouses Part 1: Intro to Paradigms
Data Lakes and Warehouses Part 2: Databricks and Snowflake
Data Lakes and Warehouses Part 3: Azure Synapse Point of ViewArtificial intelligence vs analyticsArtificial intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term for solutions that are regarded as intelligent. Search engines, smart speakers, and self-driving cars are examples of artificial intelligence. It’s often associated with system autonomy and independence from human decision-making. Analytics, on the other hand, refers to data-based reporting and visualization produced for human decision-making.The information obtained with artificial intelligence—which often means machine learning—can be utilized with analytics. Simultaneously, the available data analytics is often used to develop artificial intelligence. For example, we can find out what people want from a smart speaker and how the product meets customers’ needs. Artificial intelligence-based decision-making systems require accurate analysis of financial figures.Compared to analytics, artificial intelligence takes many steps further towards independent data use.HUS Helsinki University Hospital: 4 tips for successful AI developmentAre you hungry to learn more?Subscribe to our Tietoa Tulevasta podcast on Spotify and follow us on Instagram to stay tuned.

Fredrik Meringdal thinks he knows why.Fredrik Meringdal is not just an AI expert; he's also one of Norway's best table tennis players.Every year Universum conducts a survey to find Norway's most attractive employers and students' career preferences at Norwegian universities and university high schools, and this year almost 15,000 students voiced their opinion.In this year's survey we climb from sixth to fourth place in the list of Norway's most popular employers.The results of the survey were announced on 9 May at the Universum Awards seminar. We were named Best in the Industry as well as being one of Norway's most popular employers.Diversity and continual learningFredrik Meringdal, who joined us around a month ago and works on artificial intelligence, strongly agrees with the ranking.- I'm not surprised that we're in the top ranking. Our size and diversity put us in a strong position. If there's something you're wondering about, whether it's technical questions or advice, you don't need look far to find someone who's an expert in the field and who's only too happy to share their knowledge, says Fredrik.fFredrik made the unusual decision to quit upper secondary school and self-study, and is taking his third and final year as an external candidate. Beside winning awards in the Chemistry Olympiad for upper secondary schools and in a national mathematics competition, Fredrik is one of Norway's best table tennis players.His expectations were high before he got his job with us.- I'm positively surprised. The people here are amazing. They're friendly and are more than happy to share their knowledge with others. I like the amount of knowledge sharing that goes on between employees at TietoEVRY, he says.Personal developmentAnother factor that was important for Fredrik when choosing his future employer was our commitment to continual learning.- TietoEVRY helps you find your personal goals.

Expanding the usage of Microsoft Teams with the applications,/en/blog/2020/05/expanding-the-usage-of-microsoft-teams-with-the-applications/,Digitalization / Niina Nykänen / 26.5.2020,"Most of us use Teams for chatting, sharing files and keeping meetings but there are loads of other possibilities, too. Fewer organizations and users take the full advantage of the Teams tabs, ready-made applications, Power Platform and Office 365 services in Teams. Not to mention custom made native Teams solutions! The below picture illustrates the typical usage of Teams in organizations based on our experience.What is your company’s maturity level of utilizing Teams?How to utilize the full potential of Teams?The familiar use and functionalities of Teams can be expanded with different applications. Why would you do that? It is no longer enough to compete purely on products or services. How an organization delivers for customers is becoming as important as what it delivers. The best organizations will also adapt their processes, cultures and mind-sets to manage and optimise the entire customer experience. What is needed is full attention to the overall system for delivering business and customer value. With Teams applications it is for example possible to optimize and streamline some internal processes and to build a link between organization and its customers.There are also other concrete reasons to expand the usage of Teams with applications:creating a better digital work experience in your organization
to reduce the context switching in changing the apps
to utilize all the Office apps and other tools diversely
use the full potential of the acquired licencesThere are ready-made third-party and Microsoft applications which can be taken into use in Teams. It’s also possible to build custom applications for your organization’s own needs. The interest in this has increased during this year and it will be further emphasized. Follow these steps in your organization to rise on the next maturity level with Teams.Start to utilize the ready-made applications in TeamsThere are hundreds of different applications which are available to use in Teams. Just press … from the panel on the left-hand side in the Teams. Typical applications such as Planner, Forms, Shifts and OneNote are available to further improve the work efficiency in Teams.Develop your own custom applicationAs Teams’ use as a day-to-day collaboration platform has increased significantly, creating organization’s own custom applications makes a lot of sense. While considering the modernization of some of the current business systems, why not build them native in Teams (or with Power Apps) because Teams is used daily anyway. The application itself can be as simple or as complex as needed.It is for example possible to fetch data from customers’ digital channels or from external systems through integration(s) using Azure Integration Services. The data is handled in a Teams application using workflows and the processes can be automated with Power Automate. This can be tinted with Teams’ familiar collaboration features, Power BI data visualization and even automating processes with AI. Additionally, the Teams application can be further integrated to other stakeholders’ systems. This way Teams can act as a comprehensive back office system which integrates the end-customers from CX layer to an organization.Microsoft Teams is a versatile collaboration platform which can help the organization to modernize not only its legacy systems but also its culture and processes to a more modern direction. During this spring, it has been proven that Teams enables a seamless collaboration and working from home. Next it is time to leverage its usage with applications and take the full power out of Teams apps and Office 365 services.Got you interested?

Not only for the HR Team but most importantly for all employees throughout the company. Our daily routines involved countless switches between different platforms.After some time, we decided to implement Workday as the one and only HCM tool. I remember that when I saw Workday, I was sceptical. But then I thought that people think this way every time something new and unknown appears in their lives. At first, you feel uncomfortable, but after a while, you start to see the benefits. The story of my love for Workday is the same.Workday improves the everyday experience of the whole companyImplementation took almost nine months, but when we went live with our new, shining Workday, the quality of our work experience improved rapidly. The beginning was tough, but every single day showed us the benefits of this change. We used Workday for recruiting, hiring and onboarding, career and development management, time and absence tracking. It made working life easier for everybody! HR received a system which was logically built, and elements were interconnected. It was a big, good change, and finally, we had to remember only one password.Connectivity between Workday modules made my work easier than ever and gave a possibility to avoid problems, which used to appear when we had to migrate data between different tools. Daily work was done quickly, which was especially valuable during large hiring campaigns.The next big asset of this transformation was professional support from Workday consultants. It was especially important when we started adopting this new tool. We were not able to predict some system outcomes during the project testing phase and consultants helped to solve our unexpected issues. Their help was valuable even after we got to know Workday well. You might have the same experience from your everyday work. Sometimes you receive a surprising error and you get stuck. For such cases Workday consultant's support was irreplaceable and they gave us answers and fixed bugs whenever needed.Employees love Workday as a user-friendly tool, where they could submit working hours, request vacation, and much more. They receive a clear view for time balance, and an intuitive solution of how to do all actions which are required from the employee side.Workday users have a strong communityIn addition, as customer users we received access to the Workday Community. There you can share your ideas and vote for changes which should be added to the next system update. My daily work with the Community was a good experience. I was soon able to find solutions there without a need for additional support. This platform is a valuable source of knowledge regarding Workday. Nowadays, as a Workday consultant, I also leverage its advantages.I did not see a lot of issues with Workday, but it is fair to mention that there can be some challenges. In our case, it was a failing integration between Workday and the external platform for new employee’s background check. Using this tool outside of Workday was an exception which we needed to have due to the law restrictions. Workday has powerful integration tools, so inbound and outbound connections with other systems are not unusual. However, these need to be carefully designed and tested to avoid issues after go-live. Implementation projects are intense and as you can tell from this example – sometimes leave pending tasks behind.From the general perspective, my conclusion is that Workday is a tool which is constantly growing and adapting to the business needs. Since I have started working with Workday, it has evolved, and many new ideas were implemented with only one reason –  to make work easier for all Workday customers and their employees.Nowadays, as a consultant, I am glad I can leverage my experience of being a Workday customer myself, as well as my HR background in general. It helps me to provide relevant services to our customers today. The majority of my current colleagues have a similar experience in HR as I do and now, we can offer on-demand Cloud HCM services whenever you need a helping hand.

One million Swedes affected by the digital divide,/en/blog/2020/05/one-million-swedes-affected-by-the-digital-divide/,Digitalization / Sara Hedman / 20.5.2020,"The availability of digital services on the Internet makes things easier in countless ways and it’s difficult to imagine how society ever functioned without it. With that out-look it is alarming that not everyone has the opportunity to take advantage of the benefits of digitalization. That creates a culture divide in society were part of the population is excluded, a phenomenon called the 'digital divide'.The digital divideAccording to official statistics, almost one million Swedes say that they have never or almost never used the Internet* (SCB). That's almost 10% of the Swedish population. The demographics on this side of the digital divide are striking. The majority is made up of people born outside Europe, people in low-income households and the elderly (for example, 27% of women over the age of 75 have never used the internet). This is a varied group, but it contains some of the most vulnerable members of Swedish society. If you belong to this 10% your ability to live an independent life is limited the more social services are digitized. As the majority of Swedes enjoy ever more flexibility and convenience, the 10% become more and more isolated.Risk of exclusion increases with ageThis is an issue which is not only relevant today, but will be increasingly relevant in the future as more and more of society becomes digitalized. If we do not start to act seriously on the issue of digital exclusion, then we can all look forward to being excluded at some point.But, increasing the number of services which are available digitally does not have to mean excluding 10% of the population. There are already technologies that can facilitate interaction for many in this isolated group, where different cognitive or physical challenges are contributing to digital exclusion. It is possible to design and build digital services to be universally inclusive - you just have to want to do it.With joint efforts, from all the different actors - private as well as public - that are pushing digitalization forward, there could be significantly better conditions for many in this group to feel included in the near future.Reality or a dream?Greta is 85 with health challenges, wants to order a cake for her birthday. She has a hard time getting to the store and will therefore try to order online, for the first time. She has a tablet device that her son gave her. On the device, he configured a digital identity for her which uses Greta’s voice as the key. This works in the same way as a BankID. This feature is universally valid and is accepted on all national and local authority websites as well as her internet bank.So, Greta just turns on her tablet, authenticates herself through her voice and explains she wants to order a birthday cake. Once on the bakery’s home page, she browses the options until she finds the cake she wants. She has the option to talk directly to staff at the cake company if she wishes but she doesn’t need to.During the checkout process, she approves the purchase again using her personal voice ID. She does not have to manually enter the delivery address since that has been taken from her authenticated ID.In the scenario above what would have been a challenging task for Greta has instead been accomplished with the minimum of friction and the difficult steps in the interaction have been removed or simplified. Greta’s cake is delivered to her door on her birthday.We are not quite in Greta’s world yet, but we are close. There is a need for much clearer legislation around biometric technologies such as the one described in Greta’s case – so that it can be safely and responsibly integrated into such a solution.In addition, there needs to be much better support for the kind of seamless, holistic process which Greta experienced (from initial log-on to her device to authorizing payment on a vendor’s eCommerce site) that requires cooperation from many public and private institutions from different parts of Swedish society.But one thing is certain: it's not today's technology that causes digital exclusion. Technology is a bridge, not a barrier. Instead, today’s exclusion is due to the lack of urgency by those who drive the digitalization agenda of Swedish society and those (like TietoEVRY) who are responsible for the development and delivery of those digital services. This is where the ultimate responsibility sits and if we want to change things, we need to start addressing solutions which include 10%.TietoEVRY's own Innovation and Design unit, d|lab, is currently running the Florence project together with our digital Welfare unit. Florence is a prototype for a voice assistant for home care service users. It is precisely this target group that has difficulty accessing digitalization opportunities. Our focus has been to investigate how we with this solution might reduce the digital divide, with a focus on universal inclusive design.", Sara Hedman ,Digitalization , 20.5.2020
The future of safe driving and traffic lies in AI,/en/blog/2020/05/the-future-of-safe-driving-and-traffic-lies-in-ai/,Data / Sami Järvinen / 19.5.2020,"Safety is one of the drivers behind digitalization and technology investments in industries. Safety can be understood in many ways. In traffic, some may consider safety a feeling, while others require visible proof of accuracy or how the system operates. All things considered, technological assistants for humans or vehicles are always a matter of quality and trust.Even if an AI solution were 100% accurate, proven to save hundreds of lives and prevent thousands of accidents every year, regulations demand bulletproof evidence of this before such a system would even be considered for real life use. After acceptance, the culture of thinking also needs to change, as there is still lot of fear associated with handing human responsibilities over to automation.Automotive software developers at TietoEVRY have supported many Automotive partners in their product development projects aiming to increase the safety of driving and traffic. For example, pedestrian safety monitoring and city utilization analysis projects are interesting steps towards safer traffic. Cities and other infrastructure operators play a significant role in developing transparent and integrated solutions for urban areas.Effectiveness – and the largest impact – are only reached when data and connectivity meet use-case needs. In rapid environments such as highways or urban crossing areas, things can change dramatically fast. Thus sensing, observation, analysis, and informing need to be almost real-time. Decisions must be made locally as there is no time for moving data to back-end systems for calculation.Edge computing powered with Artificial Intelligence could be a solution in these situations. Naturally, historical data and behaviour should be analysed and learned somewhere with scalable processing power, but ultimately the operation is local and concrete.When aiming to decrease traffic accidents, the ultimate goal is minimizing human decision making. We know that risks increase whenever humans influence automated processes. There already are examples of this in aviation and manufacturing; why not in traffic management?As trust increases, autonomous and highly automated traffic solutions will slowly become reality, step by step via Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Autonomous Driving solutions. Computer vision solutions are currently are under development for image enhancement and object recognition. They will enable sensor fusion types of solutions, creating holistic understanding for example of the certain behaviour or objects, possible traffic violations, or predict the need for maintenance and other resources.Parallel to increasing safety in urban areas, costs can also be adjusted while bringing in more scalable technologies and solutions that can be retrofitted to for example older camera technology environments. When integrating the communication systems, powering with the needed amount of calculations, and scaling up with multiple data sources and computing power, the solution will create concrete safety applications for several parties such as infrastructure, network, care, safety, and automotive service and solution providers.When it comes to the different parties and technologies used, the value chains and networks in automotive and traffic domains are wide. It’s important to join forces with software companies, research institutes, universities, startups, cities, and public entities to work around real use-cases together with Investors such as manufacturers, network and service providers, and solution providers. To come up with solutions, the expected solution accuracy level needs to be clear to all parties. Systems that have operations based on visual observation should provide close to 100% accuracy, as there is no room for misunderstandings. Artificial Intelligence in different forms is one of the main technologies enabling these applications.Whenever we want something new to become normal, culture needs to be changed as well. This is what we want to promote via low risk, highly beneficial, joint proof of concept examples. Safer traffic and society will become a reality through great collaboration.Sami Järvinen’s thoughts were featured in the Finnish automotive magazine Tuulilasi’s April 2020 report: Artificial intelligence for traffic and cars.", Sami Järvinen ,Data , 19.5.2020
How to design the real-time payment systems of the future,/en/blog/2020/05/how-to-design-the-real-time-payment-systems-of-the-future/,Data / Ilkka Korkiakoski / 18.5.2020,"By looking at the shifts from one generation of payment systems to the next, there are many lessons to learn, which can be used as guidelines to develop the systems of the future.1: End-to-end solutionsReal-time payments are not purely an interbank affair. The design of real-time payment systems must take into account how real-time functionality can be leveraged to serve both individuals and business customers.One of the ﬁrst challenges is making real-time payment functionality available to all bank accounts in a market. To do this, banks will need to integrate real-time payments into their existing channels, such as online banking, as well as new and evolving channels like mobile payments.While one financial institution can’t control whether accounts at other institutions are reachable, they can focus on making sure that their own customer accounts are, and that they are user-friendly and meet customers’ needs. Being seen as a forerunner within a market by offering access to new products and services gives financial institutions an early mover advantage.2: Open architecture and standardsWhile access to real-time payment systems must be strictly managed through clear authorisation requirements and IT speciﬁcations, it is vital that the system architecture and standards are ﬂexible enough to respond to the evolving needs of both businesses and their customers.The foundation of the openness and flexibility now needed is ISO 20022. It gives financial institutions access to an extensive level of automated data, with the ability to add new messages as the system develops, and is expected to foster global interoperability in the future.3: The wider ecosystemPayment systems affect all stakeholders in a society, not just banks. Markets looking to evolve to next generation real-time systems can drive strategic ecosystem development by involving banks, merchants, corporates, government institutions, and consumer groups.This means thinking through the implications of real-time payments and how they can form the basis of a brand new ﬁnancial services ecosystem. For financial institutions speciﬁcally, this means thinking about how new products and services can be built using core infrastructure, and overlaying services to better meet customer needs.When integrating the next generation of real-time systems, financial institutions should think beyond payments as another silo within ﬁnancial services, and focus on how real-time can bring advantages throughout their customer base.4: GovernanceAs with any payments project, strong governance is essential as we move to the next generation of real-time payments - the third generation. While widespread industry participation is important in designing and deploying new real-time systems, it is important that a central governing body is empowered to approve and implement critical projects fast.This is particularly crucial in a cross-border context. For instance, the P27 Nordic Payments Initiative has brought together major financial institutions from Nordic countries to develop a pan-Nordic infrastructure for both domestic and cross-border real-time payments.  And in the Eurozone, the European Payments Council was founded to set the rules for SEPA, and help facilitate change and governance among national and regional financial institutions and associations.5: BrandReal-time functionality is only useful if end users are aware that the service exists. The most advanced real-time infrastructure in the world may not bring many beneﬁts to a market if consumers and businesses don’t use it.What’s common between countries with high adoption rates of real-time payments, is the use of a common brand for use cases, such as P2P and C2B payments.Swish in Sweden and Mobile Pay in Denmark are two good examples of branded payment apps that run on each country’s real-time infrastructure, that have seen major volume growth in recent years.Banks can still offer customised products under their own brands in other areas (e.g. B2B payments), but having a single uniﬁed brand for consumer payments can help spur acceptance and adoption. Furthermore, these apps can then expand into new use cases such as mobile POS and e-commerce, increasing their purpose for end users.Adding real valueIn conclusion, an individual bank must take in to account the beneﬁts, monetisation options, and the need to drive real-time payment adoption among its customer base. To succeed with building a growing and vibrant ecosystem of services and participants around real-time payments, profound cooperation between banks, central banks, corporates and governments is essential. Close collaboration enables creation of value-added services and killer applications both consumers and corporates love.In part one and two of our three-part blog series we discussed how to leverage real-time payments to build better customer relationships, and the value-added services that are fuelling its adoption.Read our full report on accelerating real-time payment adoption with value-added services.", Ilkka Korkiakoski ,Data , 18.5.2020
Digital culture is crucial as the Corona crisis changes our business models,/en/blog/2020/05/digital-culture-is-crucial-as-the-corona-crisis-changes-our-business-models/,Digitalization / Jesper Viktor / 14.5.2020,"This week we were invited from TietoEVRY to lead a webinar at the West Sweden Chamber of Commerce, with the theme ""Will the Corona crisis change your business model?"". We were delighted with the large turnout with hundreds of business executives from companies in the region. We got the chance to share our insights and our knowledge, but also got an opportunity to tune out of the market situation right now, at the unusual time we are in. It turned out that more than half of the companies had over 40 percent of their workforce at home. These are companies in manufacturing and trade industry. Only 15 percent thought that their own operations would return to normal within less than one year.A crisis of this kind is unique in the way it impacts demand when in many cases our habits are completely paused. Once we start to see the light in the tunnel and maybe want to buy that new couch or go out with friends for a birthday dinner - is there even an offer left?We are seeing a sharp shift in consumption habits when 70-plus people start to buy food online and the food chains have to find new logistics partners and payment methods. Those who already have a business model that meets the new needs are seeing an increase in business. The ""new normal"" takes time to adapt to for those who didn’t see this rapid change in market needs coming.Just as the communities that were well equipped for an unexpected event such as a pandemic are doing better, so are companies with a well-equipped business model. A study by the consulting firm McKinsey has shown that the airline industry is one of the most affected sectors. This does not mean that the aviation industry has not done its homework in digitization. The industry was digitized early, but since there are a number of areas in the business model that are not flexible, it binds the companies firmly. On the scale, we also see that companies in the oil and gas sector find it difficult, while at the same time tech companies and the pharmaceutical industry are largely unaffected. Traditional banks will find it a little more challenging than newer companies in the fintech sector.So, how do we ensure that our companies survive this type of unpredictable crisis? We are convinced that the answer lies in being flexible and data-driven. Make sure your business is in the cloud. It provides an opportunity to scale up and down, even in times of crisis. No one knows exactly what market demand will look like in the future, but by being data-driven you can invite yourself into an ecosystem and make yourself relevant. With the help of AI we can make more accurate forecasts to understand what the journey back to the new normal will look like.Solving the common challenges requires creativity, collaboration and a flexible business model. If you have not built a business model that can be stretched then it is high time now!15 minutes on Digital Advantage6 activities that you and your company can do to prepare for a crisis:1. Business continuity. Securing business is a process. It's something you have to maintain and exercise. Test scenario plans and get help from experts. Avega, which is part of TietoEVRY, are experts in this are.2. Secure the financial. It is expensive to change in crisis. Stress test the balance sheet!3. Build digital relationships. Get the whole company started, partners, employees and customers. This cannot be done without having everyone involved.4. Improve the business model. A flexible business model is the key to success here. Digitalisation alone is not enough. We at TietoEVRY are experts in digitalization and business development and are happy to help!5. Create a digital culture. As a leader, you need to encourage creativity and a culture where it is okay to test new ways of doing things. Dare to distribute mandates.6. Dare to invest in digitalization and digital transformation. This is where we see the road to success. The ongoing Corona crisis has increased the pressure and demand for digital services enormously, yet this is only the beginning.

Implementing Workday HCM: five things you need to consider after go-live,/en/blog/2020/05/five-things-you-need-to-consider-after-go-live/,Cloud / Mool Singh Bhati / 11.5.2020,"Picture this: your Workday go-live date suddenly seems too close for comfort as numerous challenges are threatening to derail your implementation. Completeness and accuracy of the data for your go-live tenant cannot be verified, it is not clear who will maintain integrations, and reports that were supposed to be approved by now have not even been developed. On top of it all, your implementation team is burned out.This scenario, unfortunately, becomes a reality for many Workday HCM and Finance implementation customers. Does this sound familiar to you? Don’t worry! I’ll explain what are the typical cases, and how to handle such scenarios.What are the typical HCM project post-go-live pending tasks and issue scenarios?During cut-over and go-live days, there are many things to prioritize and your team is usually quite new to handle the way Workday HCM implementation cycle works.Below I have listed five examples of topics which should be addressed after go-live.1. Business ProcessesAs we all know, backbone of Workday is business processes, and sanity of these business processes ensures smooth functioning of the system. One example of a common problem scenario is when the business process steps and conditions, which you have tested throughly during testing phase, bring unpredicted scenarios when working with different countries, different business units, or different users after go-live.Another problem might emerge when you try to remove or add a few of the step conditions, validations, help texts etc. There can also be some extra notifications, which are now bothering managers or HR team.It is important to regularly allocate people to streamline your processes and ensure that your system configuration fits the best to your current business needs.2. SecuritySecurity is also one of the most important factors and no matter how prepared you think you are, you will still find discrepancies. Fixing them will allow you to substantially improve your Cloud HCM solution.It is not unusual that customers who have been live with Workday for a while have too complex security structure, which does not fit their current business needs​. And that is why Security always need to be throughly reviewed.You can get a professional analysis of the security model. As a result you will receive suggestions on how the security model could be improved to work more efficiently and effectively.3. IntegrationsThere can be a few integrations and custom reports which were not considered in scope during the initial project, but now after the go-live you might feel the need. During cut-over and later in hypercare stage, getting quality data in place and loading it to the system is really a critical factor.Prioritize the needs and seek for extra hands, if you can not get this all in place by yourself.4. New Release UpdatesDuring some implementation projects, the solution is built and tested on the current-at-the-time Workday version, but as soon as you go live, you get a new version in. In this scenario, the latest Workday features are often not sufficiently utilised. Which results in the situation when you may not be yielding the highest return of investments in this technology.To get a maximum advantage of your new tool you need experts to review and apply the latest features. The need might come with every new Workday release and that should be taken into consideration whenever you create resourcing plans.5. End User ExperienceLast but not least, end user experience and employee engagement is always one of the important factors of a successful project. Identifying training needs in specific user groups is the key to user adoption. Extra help might come handy to identify and coordinate training paths within your company.Do you need help to ensure your Workday develops together with your business needs?It is irrevocable that successful Workday deployment and post go-live life is all about team work, co-operation between us – consultants and you – the customer side stakeholders: project manager, stream leads, HR process owners, integration owners/leads, project members, testers and third-party project providers, and integration system vendors. I always enjoyed working with you all and I hope you feel the same.Did you recognise your case in my story or do you need help with other Cloud HCM related topic?

The value-added services that are fuelling real-time payments,/en/blog/2020/05/the-value-added-services-that-are-fuelling-real-time-payments/,Data / Ilkka Korkiakoski / 8.5.2020,"Real-time systems that are designed to be ﬂexible to these changes can move quickly into new areas, to deliver better services for customers, build trust and loyalty - and increase sales. A key challenge for payment system stakeholders is working out when to upscale their real-time payment functionality. While the development of value-added services can be spurred by new use cases, others require additional functionality to blossom.Focusing on use cases can help determine new areas for the expansion of real-time products, helping to make it clear where the gaps in consumer need are. As services expand to meet current and future use cases, consumer and business adoption of real-time payments grows.Proxy servicesIn markets that have deployed real-time payments successfully, person to person (P2P) is a clear initial use case, as shown by the success of Swish in Sweden. Mobile app integration with real-time payments, combined with a proxy database that typically uses mobile phone numbers or email addresses, was enough to spur P2P adoption widely across the population. But as functionality was added, consumer to business (C2B) and business to business (B2B) use exploded, with a huge acceleration in transactions once Swish for Business and QR codes were added to the app.While it took about three years for Swish to record the ﬁrst 100 million payments, it only took four more years to record its billionth transaction – less than three years after Swish for Business was launched, and less than two and a half years after QR code functionality was added. Sustaining 100% year-on-year growth for this long would have been very difficult without introducing new services.When focusing on services offered by central infrastructures or ﬁnancial institutions, it becomes clear that most of the functionality being added in second and third generation real-time systems is focused on unlocking C2B and B2B use cases.Request-to-payRequest-to-pay (RtP) functionality is a key building block for C2B and B2C use cases, and scheme-wide solutions are being discussed in the US via The Clearing House’s RTP, in SEPA via the European Payment Council’s Working Group, and the UK’s New Payments Architecture (NPA).RtP functionality allows a beneﬁciary to initiate a transaction, by sending a payment request to the payer, who can then choose to accept the request and make a real-time credit transfer. RtP allows a real-time system to have direct debit-like functionality, while ensuring that the sender has complete control over each payment.It can also greatly improve reconciliation for billers and merchants, by incorporating messages with real-time payments, replacing direct debit and eInvoicing. Expanding use into the point-of-sale via RtP may require additional services such as dispute management, an area that card networks have developed over decades.Digital ID solutionDigital identity will become one of the biggest challenges for the ﬁnancial services industry, as more and more transactions take place in a fully digital space. Customers increasingly expect to be able to transact completely online and leverage information from various systems from a single digital identity.For example, Indian banks regularly allow customers to use their Aadhaar number - a government issued unique digital identiﬁer that uses biometric and demographic data - to send and receive real-time payments, while Nordic apps such as Swish, Mobile Pay, and Siirto allow consumers to do the same using their mobile phone number.The real challenge will be to develop digital ID services for corporates, as they often have multiple bank accounts, many unique users (employees), and may operate across borders. As customers continue to conduct more of their personal and business lives online, banks and other stakeholders will have to develop more advanced digital identity solutions that can be leveraged for real-time payments.Stay tuned for the final part in our three-part blog series, where we show you how to build the real-time payment services of the future. In part one of our three-part blog series we looked at how real time payments can help build better relationships with customers.Read our full report on accelerating real-time payment adoption with value-added services.", Ilkka Korkiakoski ,Data , 8.5.2020
To harvest value from data you must share your secrets first,/en/blog/2020/05/share-your-secrets--and-enjoy-the-benefits-of-data-and-ecosystems/,Data / Christian Diex  Rognes / 8.5.2020,"If we have learned anything from innovation studies, it is that for an organization to succeed it needs to harvest value and capabilities from its ecosystem. It must learn from others, and learning requires sharing. The ecosystem itself will be the competitive advantage of the future and managing it will be a core function in your operations.  So, how do we bridge the gap from a linear and closed organization to an eco-system of partners?The key is not owning all needed data, but in orchestrating itYour organization is probably, to some extent, driven by data already, and ecosystems are the only sustainable systems where data can continually provide value. Data itself grows in value when it is shared, re-used and combined. However, you will not have all the data you require yourself, and you also need to find ways to source external data.It is almost impossible for an organization or a society to own or even just manage all the data necessary for their mission. Hence, agile ways of orchestrating data assets should be defined and various data types should be experimented with in order to create the value you need.Look to your local ecosystemsOne strong example of such a data eco-system is our iterative collaboration with organizations tied to the Trondheim region of Norway. The municipality is wholly committed to delivering on their UN mandate as a lighthouse-city for reaching global sustainability goals. They are gathering data from businesses in the Trøndelag region in order to conduct experiments, hopefully resulting in innovations that will make citizens of the region more conscious of their carbon footprints and even enable them to take corrective actions.How do you specify a citizen’s carbon footprint? I don’t know. I don’t think anybody does. But if you can collect data from multiple sources, on individual transport preferences – energy consumption, household consumption, food preferences, investments etc. – then you can build a better profile, a digital twin of a person’s carbon footprint, and offer advice based on this knowledge. This is our objective in Trøndelag. And I am confident we will succeed.We don’t yet know exactly the final algorithms or how we would ensure consent from data subjects if we were to launch a service tomorrow. But we know that none of us have the capabilities or data to do it alone. Now we have found a way to share data within a sandbox and experiment to reach a goal that is larger than ourselves.Neither participating in relevant ecosystems nor reaping their benefits can happen overnight.

Social care e-services leap into action during Covid-19 pandemic,/en/blog/2020/05/social-care-e-services-leap-into-action-during-covid-19/,Digitalization / Carita Hirvonen / 7.5.2020,"In many municipalities, digital solutions are providing critical solutions for dealing with the challenges of the epidemic. Across social care, organizations are asking: How can we serve individuals customers without physical appointments? How can digital services help improve efficiencies in service processes? Specific attention has been paid to prepare for anticipated pressures on key social areas including income support and child protection needs.Digital citizen services already availableThe need to avoid physical contact is directly increasing the need for, and use of, e-services.  Many municipalities already use digital citizen services. TietoEVRY’s social care citizen services have been developed to be integrated directly with the Lifecare system. This removes the need for the professional to enter citizen data into the system separately. While the social care worker handles the assignment, the system integration speeds up the service chain.Digitalization is at the heart of social care development, bringing efficiencies across the entire service chain; from the electronic application for social care service or notification of the need to application processing, to decision notification and implementation. The process is also transparent, with the individual able to follow at various stages.Digital services not only reduce the need for physical appointments but minimize the need to resource phone contacts. While digital services play a key role, there will always be needs and situations where physical service is necessary, or the individual does not have the access or capability to implement or use digital transactions. However, when looking at the big picture, digitalization enhances the efficiency of social care services and frees up resources to focus on where they can deliver the most benefit.Does pandemic contribute to a digital leap?Digital services are an additional channel for accessing and delivering social care services. But one size does not fit all, every organization must adapt them to their own operations and processes, and even within the same social care organization, needs and practices may vary between different services.For some municipalities, the Coronavirus crisis has already pushed for many stages of the social care service chain to be managed remotely. E-services are now being used in some areas to deliver decision notifications, reducing the need for physical posting.These exceptional circumstances may see a huge digital leap in the area of social care. This is both a challenge and an opportunity for us to further develop solutions and functionalities - together with our customers.Read more about our Lifecare solutions for social care", Carita Hirvonen ,Digitalization , 7.5.2020
How will car software be maintained successfully for 20 years?,/en/blog/2020/05/how-will-car-software-be-maintained-successfully-for-20-years/,Cloud / Markku Tamski / 5.5.2020,"From a car being sold to the end of its service life, the lifespan of a car model can easily be 15-25 years. This is very different from industries that have driven software evolution required to work at much higher clock speeds.Looking at traditional products’ development lifecycle in different industries, the maintenance phase is often presented as the final phase of system development. The primary responsibility of maintenance has been to make sure that the product is safe to use and works as originally intended until the end of its lifespan while keeping the required changes to the product at minimum.Modern complex software products, automotive included, are no longer like this. Vehicles are connected to a larger ecosystem, with features being added, removed or rendered useless by changes in the external systems required for the features to function. Updates are a fact of life, and not a major cost issue to be avoided if possible.Vehicle safety demands add maintenance complexityWhen automotive safety is in the news for safety-related recalls, the reason is a system that doesn’t function as expected in certain conditions. It doesn’t matter if the root cause is hardware or software. There is no exception for software related issues when it comes to responsibility for vehicle safety.Connectivity brings new security challenges. Vehicles are a constant target for hacking attempts and finding vulnerabilities, as physical access to the vehicle is no longer required.As an example, security researchers identified and published a hack on a Jeep model that allowed them to remotely control any of those vehicles, and thus making all of them unsafe. The vehicle owners started a class-action lawsuit against FCA, the manufacturers of Jeep. FCA’s argument against the lawsuit wasn’t that safety responsibility does not cover software, but that none of the vehicle owners were directly affected by the hack, and that the hacked systems were promptly updated with a fix before anyone was affected.Older vehicles are especially interesting for finding vulnerabilities. Any vulnerability may end up as the reason for the next class action lawsuit if it hasn’t been taken seriously and it leads to an actual hack and danger to the customers/owners of the vehicles. Not to mention the potential for lost sales due to the vehicle being labelled unsafe.What should automotive companies do to cope with the long-term maintenance challenge?The automotive industry tries to solve this challenge via platform selection and over-the-air software updates. However, one core solution is how the software maintenance function is being integrated into the product planning process through the entire product life-cycle.With connected, always up-to-date software products, maintenance is no longer a single separate stage happening in isolation after development. The maintenance is on-going product development, sharing the same requirements.Despite the unique requirements in automotive industry, there are good lessons to learn from consumer electronics, MedTech and telecom industries that have already made the transformation from hardware to software-driven.Combining experience from these industries and having automotive industry’s specific needs in mind, there are five success factors to keep in mind to cope with very long-term software maintenance challenge:Treat maintenance as part of the product planning from start to end


Ensure that system architecture enables updates and maintenance


Use codeline management practices and DevOps processes


Use software suppliers and partners cleverly to manage the product lifecycle


Manage hardware dependenciesTietoevry has decades of experience in acting as a strategic software R&D partner in the telecom and smartphone area. The learnings are resonating well into automotive R&D partnerships.Please learn more about the five success factors mentioned above by reading the Whitepaper: Mastering Very Long Automotive Software Life Cycle", Markku Tamski ,Cloud , 5.5.2020
Why banks must leverage value-added services to build better customer relationships,/en/blog/2020/05/why-banks-must-leverage-value-added-services-to-build-better-customer-relationships/,Data / Ilkka Korkiakoski / 30.4.2020,"Real-time payments have become an important part of everyday life as they become entrenched in global markets. In a world where we are currently travelling less and doing more and more business digitally, they’ve never been more relevant. As we’ve seen with world-wide crises like the Coronavirus outbreak, real-time payments can create a big impact. Contactless payments enable purchases to be made in a safer way without physical contact, and real-time payments allow a cross-border business to continue seamlessly. They have become essential.The evolution of payment systemsIf we take a look back, we can see that real-time payment systems have evolved through the first generation – that offered real-time clearing and settlement of interbank payments - and now the second generation that brought 24/7 availability, direct technical access for non-banks, and immediate confirmation to the payment sender is making way for the third generation of real-time payments. This generation will have increased data capabilities, fraud detection and mitigation, and new processing capabilities such as tokenization.Payment systems develop just like any other system: when new technology or functionality becomes available, IT systems (and business processes) adapt to incorporate new capabilities.A vision for the futureThe third-generation systems will allow all participants to develop data-rich value-added services that leverage core clearing and settlement infrastructure. By partnering with third parties and creating ecosystems that provide value-added services, banks will be able to provide improved customer experience, retain a central position in providing payment services, and increase revenue.The result will be a move away from a siloed approach to payments, that will enable financial institutions to continuously evolve to changing customer demands and utilise technology as it continues to progress.Furthermore, the third-generation real-time payment systems will bring in a new era where value-added services take centre stage. These systems are designed to separate the core clearing and settlement engine from a platform layer that allows for the continuous exchange of value-added messages, that can be used to develop innovative new products and services.Ready for the rising expectationsDevelopment of an open system architecture that allows banks to quickly develop new products and services, monetise them and fill the gaps in consumer need, will spur the progression of real-time payments.With a wide variety of new players and services being offered in digital marketplaces, to both consumers and businesses, real-time systems will need to accommodate both payment and informational messages that are exchanged continuously between parties. Banks, in particular, may need to re-assess existing IT and business processes to prepare for the leap into the future to remain competitive and continue to add value to their customer relationships.In part two of our future of real-time payment series, we’ll be showing how value-added services are forcing banks and third parties alike to change their payments strategy.Read our full report on accelerating real-time payment adoption with value-added services.", Ilkka Korkiakoski ,Data , 30.4.2020
COVID-19: Role of public cloud in sustaining your business,/en/blog/2020/04/covid-19-role-of-public-cloud-in-sustaining-your-business/,Cloud / Shubham Keshri / 28.4.2020,"Situation is such that there is a shift in demand in certain parts of businesses, and certain segments of businesses came out dry. How can IT have an impact on this?The solution lies behind the term we have been casually tossing around: “scalability”. We often made decisions of IT costs, by evaluating fixed prices of whether storage or processing power. Only because it was “easy” for our businesses to make a decision on cost! What was bought in the end was heavy machines with huge storage and processing power which was localized for reasons of security. Not to mention, high perpetual licensing costs. Some companies unfortunately must be paying still without being able to generate any revenue on that setup.How to scale up with public cloud?This is not a time to start the transition to cloud. Gartner already said this years ago: it’s not a question of “If” anymore. It’s the question of “How?” Assuming we already are on some public cloud, what have we not done enough?One baby step of moving to public cloud has already given you opportunities to “work remotely”. We have seen and are facing difficulties in the bandwidth with our glorious VPN. Some companies must be benefiting from investing in direct connections from on-premise to public cloud like Azure Express route and AWS direct connect. But have we really done anything about “scalability” which we addressed in the very beginning?8 concrete examples of scalable cloud componentsMoving your on-premise systems to cloud doesn’t bring much benefit, other than worldwide access to them. To benefit in terms of scalability in storage, compute and cost, one must design solutions around native cloud components which offer scalability. To name some:1. File system storage -> AWS S3 / Azure data lake store2. SQL server / MySQL Database -> Azure SQL DB / AWS RDS3. On-premise / Virtual machine Datawarehouse -> Azure Synapse Analytics / AWS Redshift / Snowflake4. Cassandra VM installations -> Azure CosmosDB5. Running Python / Java code on VM -> Serverless Azure functions / AWS lambda6. CI / CD On-premise / VM installations -> Azure Devops / AWS Codepipeline7. On-premise / VM based DNS -> Azure DNS / AWS Route 538. On-premise / VM based ETL tools -> Azure Datafactory, Data Bricks / AWS Glue / Informatica cloudNative cloud solutions bring the scalabilityThe pandemic has revealed the strength of native cloud solutions as the demand is very polarized: some industries, like healthcare and retail, see exponentially growing demand in safety critical systems and analytical needs. And at the same time, some industries like manufacturing, experience a massive decline in business. The scalability cloud nativity essentially is bringing both, upscaling and downscaling.The bottom line is to utilize more and more of cloud native components while designing any IT solution. If your application is not listed here, there are still ways to design it scalable and resilient for example, by utilizing load balancers and other components in cloud.It’s not only about techThe pandemic has also revealed the strengths of outsourcing strategy which in the emerging economy is often looked down on. By outsourcing the development and functions that you are not a specialist, anyway, gives you now the possibility to cut down costs neatly. An analogy can be drawn by comparing, IT vendors to public cloud. Where consultants are pool of virtual machines. Of course, then clients must be ready for being generous to avail this freedom in scalability of resources.Do you still want to stay on-premise and hire own employees? Well, that certainly depends!Let’s take example of two manufacturing companies and compare their cloudification strategy. Both companies migrated their legacy Oracle data warehouse to cloud.The first one decided to instantiate a heavy virtual machine on Azure and run SQL server database. They are now still paying the VM plus database license costs.The second one migrated to Snowflake: They are now only paying minimal amounts for cloud storage on Azure, whereas compute costs have cut down a lot.The first one is also spending money on arranging co-operation negotiations and laying off people, whereas the second one has just reduced the consultancy they purchase to minimum.All in all, this is not a time to just cut-down expenses rather this is an opportunity to prepare, be proactive and invest strategically to recover from the impacts of the on-going situation after life resumes normal. Consumer and business buying behavior is naturally going to change dramatically after this quarantine period.Is your organization prepared for scalability and shift in demand?Connect with me on LinkedIn to get the insights directly to your newsfeed!", Shubham Keshri ,Cloud , 28.4.2020
Voice it! Will virtual assistants become a vital part of the future?,/en/blog/2020/04/will-virtual-assistants-become-a-vital-part-of-the-future/,Digitalization / Even Lokøy / 24.4.2020,"A recent study shows that a third of the entire population of the US already use virtual assistants in some form (source). Another study made in 2017 showed that 98% believe that they would use voice-controlled assistants 5+ years in the future (source). Naturally, we have become more familiar and comfortable with these voice-controlled services over time. Google, Alexa, Siri, Cortana, Viv, Watson, Bixby, Mycroft. The list is long and still growing.However, many associate the VA’s with trivial tasks such as setting a timer for the pizza in the oven, playing your favorite music playlist, answering questions you would normally search online, or just simply their inability to understand your question.   Further, the way these applications have been designed makes them a subject for a continuous debate of personal data privacy. Today, VA’s work by recording the user commands, and then sends this voice recording to a cloud processor that identifies the user intention.The way users express themselves can vary greatly in language, accent, context and tones. Interpreting user intents with such great variations require more computational power than what is typically available in most phones and smart speakers, hence the need for cloud processing.The voice recordings of the users (I.e. the data) is often by default stored in the vendors own cloud storage, giving them access to huge amounts of personal data that its users might want to keep private. Numerous incidents of privacy breach do not soothe the public opinion on the matter. For instance, there have been reported incidents where VA’s have accidentally recorded private conversations and then, by mistake, forwarded the recording to people in the user’s own contact list (source). Also, user data has been sent to other users (source), or listened to by human employees by the cloud processor (source).These alarming discoveries make it natural to ask whether virtual assistants will play a crucial role in the future, or if they are just overhyped, trivial AI-applications?Most innovations suffer challenges at some point, but fortunately, many of them manage to overcome and solve these obstacles through various solutions. VA’s ability to both understand and speak languages has greatly improved over the years as requirements and expectations have increased.  Recent advancements in deep learning have had an impact on the field of virtual assistants. For instance, the WaveNet-architecture developed by Google has made an improvement for natural voice synthesizing (source). This architecture has been an important contribution when creating Google Duplex. Google Duplex can call humans by phone and perform narrow tasks such as making an appointment at the hairdresser. It can do so without the person at the other end noticing that he or she is talking to a machine. Even though this might seem like a small task, it truly is a tremendous achievement!  Human to human communication can be very complex. We often correct or rephrase ourselves mid-sentence, use pause words like “uhm” frequently, and the pace and tone of our speaking can vary greatly. If you add the fact that we can have local variations of expression ourselves, like dialects and sociolects, one can see the complexity that comes from regular conversations.Consequently, for a machine to be able to interpret human intention based on their natural language is a challenging task. The usual way to solve this is for humans to be very specific in their communication with machines, and not using natural languages. Following the advancements in language understanding and speech synthesizing, human to machine communication can increasingly contain natural language without confusing the machine.Virtual assistant has the potential to be as natural as having a conversation with another personAnother result of the advancements in AI is the development of semantic search. Instead of just matching your search words with similar hits online, semantic search can analyze the full context of your query, such as the emotions behind it, and combine it with known user data and thus enriching the result. Semantic search in combination with the natural language communication will give the user a personalized feeling when interacting with voice assistants. With these rapid technological developments, our interactions with VA’s has the potential to be as natural as having a conversation with another person.In the future, we can also expect to see VA’s that is able to process the user commands locally on-device, rather than the data being transmitted to a datacenter. This field of artificial intelligence is called Edge AI, or simply edge computing. This is the type of technology that Tesla and other car vendors use to make their cars able to be aware of its surroundings and to make decisions based on them. Self-driving cars need to be able to make decisions quickly and cannot rely on cloud services that might lag. Therefore, the vehicles must have huge data processing abilities on the device itself. In many ways, it is the heart of future autonomous vehicles.Imagine that the virtual assistant could provide the elderly with information?By removing the need for online processing of user voice recordings, virtual assistants with on-device processing will shorten the response time. Removing this part of the equation will also increase user privacy since it has no need to process personal data in the cloud. Consequently, a wide range of opportunities could be opened for VA’s. One might, for example, imagine that the virtual assistant could provide the elderly with information about their medications and whether they have taken their medication.Further, VA’s with on-device processing abilities can be trained to detect other noises as well, such as a person falling in their home. This way, the device can assist you in other ways than just by voice commands. For instance, it can call for healthcare personnel if the person is not responding after falling, or it can function as a house alarm if it detects that a window gets broken.A feature that has already been developed but has yet to be utilized in virtual assistants is biometric authentication. Biometric authentication can be done through facial recognition, voice recognition, fingerprint recognition or by recognizing other personal traits. By utilizing this feature in VA’s the user can have the opportunity to choose whether the application should only be operated by yourself, or if you will grant access rights to others as well.The implications of this is that you don’t risk anybody else accessing personal data from the device, whether it be people who want to access credit card information or just your children who want to pay for games with your device. Edge computing will open a whole new range of applications and opportunities for voice assistants. The combination of uniquely identifying users and on-device processing will make it possible for these devices to process highly sensitive data while still maintaining user privacy, such as health-related data. This way, the voice assistant can, for example, assist patient with self-care in their own home.  Today we might view virtual assistants as simple and immature applications, but I am confident that they will be a crucial part of our future lives. The user experience will become much better, making interactions richer and more natural. Their ability to process information on-device will open a whole new range of opportunities. All in all, virtual assistants will become more complex ecosystems that can support you in multiple areas of your everyday lives.I am particularly excited about the opportunities that VA’s bring to those who feel less confident with interacting with computers. Through experience, I have seen the excitement and empowering experience that interacting with virtual assistants can give, especially for those who feel less confident around computers. The inclusive design of voice-controlled units holds great promise for utilization in areas where the users are usually less tech-savvy. Therefore, I believe that areas such as home care and elderly care are likely to be transformed by this technology in the future.Currently the Dlab, TietoEVRY Industry Software own Innovation & design unit, is running the project Florence. Florence is a prototype for a voice assistant for clients in elderly care and right now the dLab is testing how she is perceived by the users and how to use the technology in a secure way.", Even Lokøy ,Digitalization , 24.4.2020
Beyond the outbreak: 6 strategic actions to ensure customer experience in the new horizon,/en/blog/2020/04/beyond-the-outbreak-6-strategic-actions-to-ensure-customer-experience-in-the-new-horizon/,Digitalization / Jari Kekkonen / 23.4.2020,"The outbreak changed the business environment of most industries just in few weeks maybe more than we really realize yet. Even if the crisis is still upon us, it is time to start thinking beyond it and prepare for the future horizon. We have already learnt a lot from the outbreak and can expect certain changes and implications to become more long-lasting in post-epidemic world.Long-lasting changes in customer expectations: what have we learnt from the outbreak already now?Shopify Inc. – one of the leading e-commerce platform provider operating in 175 countries – tweeted last week that their normal daily online traffic is already at the same level than last Black Friday. Amazon announced all time high deliveries last week too. A Finnish retailing conglomerate Kesko indicated that their online grocery grew almost 700% very recently leading to severe fulfilment and pick-up challenges in delivery stores.Alongside with the booming online shopping, mobile and card payment options – especially contactless payment options – are being adopted faster than ever both online and offline. Microsoft, Zoom, Slack and many other online meeting and collaboration platform providers have reported even 10x or so rise in their user base in certain markets since extensive lockdowns began several weeks ago.The marketing and advertising budgets of many companies are getting axed which, on the other hand, have forced marketing leaders to re-think their marketing and engagement strategies in these days. It won’t be surprise if brands and manufacturers also gradually transfer the remarkable chunk of the axed marketing budgets from offline to online to reach more efficiently widely cocooning customers.Even if many restrictions have been in force just a short period of time in most western countries, the coronavirus outbreak will leave a long-lasting impact on us. Tens of millions of people across the globe have made a huge leap in the adoption rate of digital collaboration and engagement tools and e-commerce services – just in few weeks. This alone will accelerate the change of many our preferences and old habits - how we evaluate, shop and consume products and services - even in very old-fashioned industries.Although the outbreak is a severe global health and economic crisis, it will also create new jobs and work, and seems to push many emerging digital business models across the chasm such as online grocery, B2B commerce, e-learning, mobile payment, etc.Post-outbreak imperatives for customer operations and customer experienceBased on the learnings we have already now, we believe all brands and vendors aiming to differentiate with great customer operations and experience should consider embracing the following actions as new imperatives going forward:1. Prepare for digital first economy even in old-fashioned industry. People across the globe are extensively forced to rely primarily on digital channels and online shopping options across the board during the lockdown. Millions of people are first time buying online. Many product categories are sold extensively online first time ever such as groceries but also many industrial products. This will change e-commerce landscape permanently. It is time to re-think what sells online versus offline. This is also a great opportunity to streamline and integrate sales processes across channels and finally turn the organisation and processes genuinely to customer centric.2. Re-define your customer segmentation and engagement strategy. The coronavirus outbreak will change permanently your customers’ behaviour, habits and engagement preferences. Existing customer segmentation and engagement models must be re-visited. Don’t be surprised if your machinery customer next time prefers online meetings or spot-on webinars instead of travelling or traditional business conference sessions. New preferences and habits might also boost the latent demand for new industrial services such as turn-key deliveries, vendor managed inventories, predictive remote maintenance, virtual shopping experience, etc.3. Make a difference by arming sales and customer service agents with digital tools that help them to reduce customer frustration and collaborate in any channel. Many companies have failed to provide even average level of customer service in digital channels during the outbreak. Many complex services and industrial processes are still lacking feasible digital tools and processes to meet customers equally online and offline. On the other hand, those who have understood the role of omnichannel and integrated sales and customer service already before the outbreak and made necessary digital investments have even bigger edge over others now in the midst of crisis. A laggard, it is not yet too late to make your customer service and sales reps customer experience superstars and arm them with integrated digital collaboration and customer data weapons. That will boost your customer service job satisfaction too.4. Customer is a king but make high-quality content a queen – especially in digital channels. As customers our needs to find quickly answers usually surge in uncertain times and during unexpected events like now. High-quality content and relevant information keep your customers happy and “self-served” also in peak times without sacrificing cost structure of customer service and sales organisation. Content plays a key role in all phases of customer journey, like getting customers attention, search and evaluation, products comparisons, inventory availability check, payment terms, personalized recommendations etc. In each of these moments of truth, tens, hundreds or thousands of competing alternatives are fiercely trying to win your customer’s attention. The high-quality digital content and personalized communication pays back especially now.5. Re-assess business continuity plan of customer operations. The outbreak was expected but still too few were truly prepared. We need to prepare to face the second wave of the Covid-19 virus and other similar crises in future. Every organisation should re-assess their existing business continuity plans and ensure more outbreak-resistant criteria and measures for marketing, sales and customer service operations in the digital first economy.6. Implement agile innovation process and customer-centric culture that is prepared for unexpected sudden changes and customer behaviours in market environment. Agile methods have been adopted in many businesses already for years in a team, unit or even corporate level. At best, agile innovation is part of the corporation culture. Agile innovation methods boost business and product innovation in good times, but they can become even vital for facing unexpected challenges in whole business environment like now with extensive social distancing, lockdowns and other restrictions. In particular, the agile methods help greatly to pivot existing mode of operations and quickly find out new alternative customer-centric ideas, offerings and service models – be they temporary or more permanent.Scenario-based planning will help your business to navigate out of the mist to the new horizonA scenario-based planning is a great approach to understand past, present and explore the future. It requires honesty, openness and braveness, but tends to be very golden in the middle of complex uncertainty when business visibility in a mist is short.Connecting customer insight into tangible scenarios as well as longer-term considerations around shifts in target markets or business models are the elements to be considered when navigating out of the mist as a winner.Indeed, we consider scenario-based approach together with the presented new customer operations related imperatives very efficient and pragmatic way to attack also the challenges and uncertainties of current outbreak.Do you need help with re-visiting your customer experience strategy and scenarios for the post-outbreak horizon?

"Why the supermarket chain, telecom operator or bank should start selling energy services",/en/blog/2020/04/why-the-supermarket-chain-telecom-operator-or-bank-should-start-selling-energy-services/,Cloud / Matti  Seppänen  / 23.4.2020,"The energy market revolution and opening energy markets are creating new possibilities for the retail industry to complement their traditional offering with new, digital consumer-oriented services. According to several studies, the market already exists, and its value is expected to further develop to be several billion in Europe alone. With the new opportunities for retail businesses to create energy services, now is the right time to grab consumer market share using smart technologies.Key to this transformation are Distributed Energy Services.Smart energy management is a sellable productYour business already manages its energy consumption by optimising energy consumption in offices, stores, distribution centres and datacentres. To do it efficiently, you’re probably using, or at least moving towards using, energy from different sources and managing the system digitally based on data, analytics and IoT.Why wouldn’t you expand the smartness of your system to your customers?You can connect your customers to the same management circle. By offering them smart services, you can enhance your sustainable brand perception while achieving better customer retention and loyalty. Your consumer customers benefit from services that improve their quality of life and at the same time lower their energy bills.The business case is thereThe usual stumbling block for entering the services market has traditionally been the installation cost of equipment. If you wanted to offer smart services at the end-customer’s premises, such as energy management or home automation, the initial cost has been prohibitively high.With smart energy management, you can turn the situation round, whether you’re a retail chain, telecom operator, bank or insurance company. In exchange for the cost benefit and comfort, your customers will be happy to control – or allow you to control – their energy consumption. You can draw energy from their electric vehicles, home batteries or solar panels, manage how and when their home appliances work and guide their energy usage to periods that fall outside of expensive peak periods.Low-hanging fruit – if you’re ready for an ecosystemYou will, though, need a field service to implement the system. That is why you need to be prepared for an ecosystem-based operating model. Although this will give a slice of the pie to external actors, the gross benefit will still increase your earnings.According to polls conducted in the Nordics, as many as 35 per cent of consumers would not only be willing to sign up, they would also invest up to €1,000 in a system like this in exchange for ease of use, lower energy bills, loyalty bonuses and the knowledge of taking concrete steps towards carbon neutrality.In the spirit of “saving the planet”, energy management is an attractive option to the modern sustainability-conscious consumers. They will be happy to concretely participate in the energy market both as micro-generators and allowing their assets to be used as a virtual power plant.Tap into millions of unused potentialLeveraging your existing customer base and customer commitment, you can engage your consumer customer, optimise energy trading, earn income from reserve markets through demand response and manage demand peaks, thereby potentially avoiding the purchase of expensive peak power.You get a holistic, real-time overview of your operations, so you can see how to optimise them and generate new revenue streams. The initial investment in systems to be installed in consumers’ homes can be recovered through service fees, efficient energy management and decreasing customer churn. The growing numbers of electric vehicles increase the potential even further.Sustainability, participation and new revenue streamsSaving energy and optimising its consumption are sustainability acts. Enabling active participation in the energy market by managing energy assets will help climate change even further and provide new revenue streams. The market is already there – and its potential is rising.The earlier you realise the benefits of distributed energy potential to your business, the more you stand to gain.TietoEVRY is the Nordic leader in energy optimisation as-a-service.

I use the Robot Framework, but I am curious to see what other tools I can learn to use in the future.With Tietoevry, I have the opportunity to grow in two careers at once, building on both my formal education and 13 years of ice hockey. I have been playing ice hockey for approximately 13 years. My sports career has spanned different teams, but right now I play on the Kiekko-Espoo women’s team. I have two Finnish championships, one Olympic bronze medal and the historic 2019 World Championship silver medal.So how have I managed both of my careers?It has not always been easy, to be honest, but  have figured out a balance that works for me. As it turned out, everyone here at Tietoevry has been very supportive about my athletic career – and I’m grateful for being able to fulfil two of my career goals at the same time.I have agreed on a 30-hour workweek with my manager, so I have enough energy for both my work and for training. What has proven to be very helpful is flexible working hours that allow me to attend morning practices and modify my workday to fit my training and game schedule – and to work longer hours when I have a chance.There are also two gyms at Tietoevry headquarters, which has been useful for my off-ice training. I go to the gym quite regularly, once or twice a week. One of the gyms is on the top floor next to a yoga studio, which I use for stretching while admiring its view of the sea.The best of both worlds – learnings and future goalsOne of the most important things that ice hockey has taught me is how to be a team player and work together. That is a skill that I use in my daily work at Tietoevry. Working with others always teaches me something new, and helping others is very fulfilling.Based on my experience, the most important requirement when combining two careers is to communicate with your manager and project team openly and frequently, so you can work out a schedule that supports both your athletic and work responsibilities.My goals and dreams for the future are to continue combining both of my passions. Within the tech industry, I will want to finish my Master's degree in Information Technology, continue to develop my skills as a tester and perhaps incorporate more information security into my work. And in sports, my next goal is to play in the 2022 Olympics.", Ella Viitasuo ,Meet our people , 17.4.2020
Coping with a pandemic: Improving citizens’ everyday lives through digital services,/en/blog/2020/04/coping-with-a-pandemic-improving-citizens-everyday-lives-through-digital-services/,Cloud / Markus Hautala / 15.4.2020,"The current corona pandemic has proven to be a significant acid test for the digital society. Before the current crisis, many of us probably believed that our society is capable of operating fully digitally. Under a thin veneer of digitalization was the harsh reality; digitalization was not equally distributed in our society. For many people, essential citizens’ services were yet to be digitalized. Therefore, the small silver lining in the current situation is that hopefully – finally – things will change. This is now the time to transform our society into more digitally inclusive.Social benefits are one key area where there are still significant digitalization steps to be taken. Take basic social assistance as an example. The customer first needs to visit Kela (The Social Insurance Institution of Finland) office in order to get a payment guarantee and then visit a physical store to buy groceries. Now imagine that you’re at home in Corona quarantine and out of money. What are you expected to do in a situation like this? What can you do? Should you just drag yourself to the Kela office and then to a store whilst putting the Kela officer, store clerk and numerous other people at risk? Or do you stay at home and starve?The above is obviously a dramatized hypothetical instance, and I’m sure that social services will find ways to help people in need. This, however, is not an imaginary situation but a very real one; and a problem that social security services have now needed to solve.What if, instead of physically visiting a Kela office and a store, you could simply receive a digital payment guaranteed from Kela, which you could then use online to buy groceries? This is exactly what Kela and TietoEVRY have been working towards since last fall. Announced in early April, Kela and TietoEVRY in cooperation with Finnish Tax Administration, Financial Supervisory Authority of Finland and Borenius Attorneys have built a Smart money proof of concept. The details of this can be read here.Smart money is a conditional digital payment guarantee. It relies on computer protocols which enforce preset conditions for its use, for example who may use the payment guarantee, what products and services can be bought with it, and where.From the user’s perspective, Smart money knows what it can be spent for, where and by whom. From the end user’s perspective Smart money is designed to be very simple; it works in a similar manner as existing digital payment methods, such as for example Apple Pay.In addition to the above mentioned Kela use case, Smart money can serve many others. In fact, within the proof of concept, the feasibility of Smart money was specifically evaluated in the context of rehabilitative psychotherapy reimbursements. Other use cases that we identified include basic social assistance vouchers for medication, eyeglasses, moving costs and home insurance. Smart money could also digitalize service vouchers, such as those used for private care support.Furthermore, Smart money is not intended to be limited to be only used by Kela. Our ambition for it is to become a general purpose instrument that could also be used by the private sector for example for insurance compensations, lunch and commute benefits, loyalty points, gift cards, travel cards and even weekly allowances in families.Alongside with the results and experiences gained from the Smart money proof of concept, we have many possibilities and opportunities to improve upon the society’s ways to cope with emergencies such as the current one.  It is quite evident – I think – how these kinds of innovative digital solutions can enhance everyday lives of citizens and how immense benefits they can bring.  Smart money is just one example.Digitalization is an equalizer in the society as it brings the same services to everyone, providing equal opportunities.Do you want to hear more about the possibilities to digitalize citizens’ services? Feel free to contact me to discuss.", Markus Hautala ,Cloud , 15.4.2020
Virtual is the new reality,/en/blog/2020/04/virtual-is-the-new-reality/,Digitalization / Ksenia Avetisova / 14.4.2020,"Suddenly, not only were large events cancelled, but face-to-face contact became a thing of the past. Travel has since been restricted and the schools are now closed. The change was swift and, for some, brought many unexpected changes to the work environment and set-up - with the majority of communication shifting to different levels of the virtual realm.In these times of social distancing and self-isolation, people crave human interaction like never before. Technology has become a definitive enabler allowing us to connect with friends, relatives and colleagues. Furthermore, it has pushed companies and public organisations to reinvent their approach to delivering services and connecting with their customers.While companies are exploring new ways to engage with audiences and colleagues worldwide, let’s take a look at the opportunities in virtual reality that are already creating added value and providing concrete support for businesses.Virtual events and meet-ups are stepping beyond the boundaries of webinars on the flat screen. Instead, they are taking viewers to a 3D world where interactive avatars provide an unparalleled feeling of presence. The whole concept is taken to a new level by multi-channel participation options. During a time when nearly every conference and event around the globe has been cancelled, some have opted to shift to a virtual environment. Taking your audience into an augmented and virtual collaboration space offers a deeper connection when working on a joint project or communicating your vision. By doing so, experts and users are brought together in a common space to facilitate dynamic and constructive work towards their common goal.
Virtual tours offer the possibility to visit different places without having to physically travel there. Consider taking your customers and partners to a production site or an on-going construction project via 360 live streaming or 3D reconstruction. Such an approach is bound to provide an extra layer of safety, security and environmental benefit – think solving challenges via telepresence. One concrete example is Green Mountain, which seeks to attract clients from around the world. Their virtual tour is meant to provide a first impression for potential clients and bring them onboard as well as encourage current partners to speed up their decision-making process. An equally impactful case is the virtual overview of the ecosystem that Metsä Wood has brought to virtual reality with our help.
Scaling up operating capacity quickly becomes critical for organisations in times of high uncertainty. A mixed reality training and onboarding process provide a shortcut to the efficient teaching of less experienced members of the workforce. It also ensures continuous performance at to the highest standards, as well as augmented and mixed reality support in learning and solving challenges. Additional value is brought by the fact that new employees can be onboarded more efficiently and safely. For example, we worked with Greiner to create their Next Generation Training in mixed realityThe current situation has already pushed the world out of its comfort zone, but this is the perfect opportunity to experiment and find new ways of connecting and collaborating. Nothing stops us from taking a few steps and entering the immersive dimension. As Tom Clignez, Business Developer at TietoEVRY pointed out “Luckily, the state of XR technology today is advanced enough to enable easy, fast & affordable access for wide audiences. In crisis situation this provides possibility to leverage its full potential for business and user benefit”. For example, in the healthcare sector, thousands of professionals have been using virtual reality simulation to get the latest insights on patient diagnostics and care connected to the crisis.There is no doubt that there is no going ‘back to normal’ after the crisis dissolves - our approach to work, learning and life will be reinvented.Are you ready to take your experience to the next level with virtual and augmented reality?Reach out to the TietoEVRY XR team to discuss immediate and long-term opportunities for your business.During April, our team is offering free consultations to share our experience and the latest insights to help you devise a virtualisation strategy for your business xr.lab@tietoevry.com.", Ksenia Avetisova ,Digitalization , 14.4.2020
"With these fundamentals, the cloud just became safer",/en/blog/2020/04/with-these-fundamentals-the-cloud-just-became-safer/,Cloud / Harri Kallioniemi / 6.4.2020,"Only in movies do the hackers hammer their keyboards in dark rooms with blinking LED lights in the background. In real life, hackers typically send targeted emails that contain attachments with malicious code that opens up the initial point of entry for them. But only if the user opens the attachment. The “human element” is hard to control in security.What we can do is to make it as hard as possible for hackers to move forward from that point onward – by limiting their capability to gain access to data and quickly recovering from an attack, knowing that we have totally wiped them out from our systems. Implementing these measures is possible in any environment, but it’s far easier and also cheaper to do in the public cloud.Data security is of essence also in today’s mobile working life, as millions of people use cloud-based services while performing their duties remotely. Fortunately, cloud platforms with the right kind of safety mechanisms make it easy for companies to trust that all business-critical data is provided and handled in a secure way.The fundamentals: automation, encryption and loggingThe first step is to implement the proper segregation of duties. The aim here is that if an attacker gets access to one of the accounts, the exposure is limited to an absolute minimum. But the more granular your setup, the more time (i.e. money) it takes to implement. We talk about days, if not weeks, of work for each workload. This is when the rubber meets the road and we take the shortcuts where, with just one password, the attacker has gained access that is far too wide. The reason for the shortcut could be as simple as lack of time or money, but that is the reality in everyday IT.Now, enter automation based on code – the only sustainable way to ensure proper segregation of duties with a low enough price tag and fast enough implementation time. It involves heavier initial setup costs, but then every single environment is guaranteed to be set up in the agreed secure way. Each public cloud provider has a set of best practices for how account and user access setup should be conducted.The second step is to encrypt data. Even if the attacker is able to gain account access, they would be unable to read the data without an encryption key. Cloud platforms provide encryption for data both at move and at rest, including needed key management services. This should also solve worries one could have about the Cloud Act.The third step is to ensure that your environment stays compliant with your agreed security and governance rules and that you have the needed audit logs. The huge difference here is that since you run code instead of performing manual clicking, you first of all know exactly which code versions have been used for each environment and thus what and how security measures were configured. And you can prove everything with logs. Secondly, you can set up alerts to notify you of any accounts set up to bypass the agreed security.Preventing security breaches does not require sci-fi solutionsLastly, if the worst of the worst happens and you are seriously hacked, your biggest headache will be figuring out what the attacker was able to modify and what security vulnerabilities they may have left behind. And unfortunately, this will be a fast-moving target, as the attacker will continue to operate in the environment and reopen vulnerabilities you have already closed. I have read about cases where this cat-and-mouse game went on for months, in some cases years. The only way to ensure a clean environment is reinstallation, but with the traditional manual method, this is a last resort – whereas with the Infra as Code approach we’re talking about a real and feasible solution.These measures discussed above are not science fiction but strategies we are already helping our customers to implement today. With these measures employed, I would personally place far more trust in the public cloud to store my business-critical data compared to any other.I also claim that with the increasing focus on data privacy and business continuity in the digital world, these measures will quickly become mandatory and be enforced by regulatory bodies and organizations’ internal security and compliance units. By adapting this straightforward approach now, you will secure your systems – and business operations – for years to come.", Harri Kallioniemi ,Cloud , 6.4.2020
Marketing in times of uncertainty: agile and experimental or structured and rational?,/en/blog/2020/04/marketing-in-times-of-uncertainty-agile-and-experimental-or-structured-and-rational/,Digitalization / Juliana Tobon / 2.4.2020,"Uncertainty is particularly challenging for marketing managers as most activities happen in a constantly changing environment. In addition to market and technological uncertainties, they also deal with limited resources.These circumstances call for an agile approach, in which companies experiment and learn by doing. The challenge with this approach is that the gains from agility start decreasing after a certain point. From that point on, it might make more sense to put in place carefully designed structures and processes.A combination of the two approaches might sound like an optimal solution, but where do we draw the line between more agile and experimental and more structured and strategic?Here are some points to consider.Adapted from: Mero, Tarkiainen & Tobon (2019). Effectual and causal reasoning in the adoption of marketing automation. Industrial Marketing ManagementBe agile when maturity is low and uncertainty highAre you planning to adopt a new technology, expand the functionality of an existing one or start a marketing activity that you have not done before?These cases often require you to acquire new knowledge and change your way of doing things. In this kind of situation, uncertainty is high. Here, an agile mode is recommended, as it allows you to focus on gaining new knowledge rapidly. As uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate the returns of an activity, focus on the affordable losses, seek an incremental approach, and make the most of the available resources to turn the uncertainties or threats into opportunities.For example, companies that are implementing advanced data-driven marketing use cases are at this stage, currently. Combining behavioural, transactional, demographic and firmographic data is complex. The uncertainty surrounding the results of campaigns using customer data is high. . Therefore, the best approach is to be agile and focus on testing the different hypotheses to find what works.Increase structure when your knowledge and experience increaseAs you and your team become more comfortable with the technology and get things done, you should start bringing more structure into your activities. Reaching a certain comfort level indicates that it is the proper moment to switch from agile and experimental to a more strategic, well-planned, and goal-oriented method.A more strategic method enables you to better plan your resources and scale up existing activities. This is a good time, for example, to expand marketing activities to a new market or a novel customer segment, increase the utilization of marketing technologies or optimize existing activities or campaigns.For instance, companies that adopted Marketing Automation some years ago are now reaching this more stable point. The understanding around the technology has been built, the first use cases are live and some of the crucial processes are in place (such as the lead management process). This is usually when companies can plan the allocation of resources and their roadmap for marketing automation activities in a better way.Be ready to experiment againAre the customer needs evolving in a way that requires your company to start developing new activities, advancing the complexity of existing ones, or even adopting new technologies? When the gains from optimizing the things done in the past are about to reach a stagnation point, innovating becomes crucial.This results in a need to change back to effectuation.  This can take different forms, depending on the company. Usually, in marketing, it translates into developing new channels of customer engagement and/or implementing more advanced use cases or campaigns such as predictive marketing. Typically, these require the adoption of a new technology or the integration of an existing one. And all of these increase the number of customer data points.", Juliana Tobon ,Digitalization , 2.4.2020
Secrets to run a successful workshop with Teams,/en/blog/2020/04/secrets-to-run-a-successful-workshopwith-teams/,Digitalization / Henna Sopanen / 1.4.2020,"Microsoft Teams has become a familiar yet critical for us to collaborate. When there is nothing new in online meetings or chatting, the next challenge is to learn to facilitate successful, engaging and fun workshops with Teams. How to keep the participants active and focused, and how to encourage dialog during the workshops?Let’s dig into it!Practical tips for organizing a successful workshop virtually1. It’s not a monologue! Engage the participants during the workshopWhen planning the workshop, as a preparation, consider how you courage people to join the conversation during the meeting. This is extremely important virtually, when lacking the eye contact with the participants. Teams offer several alternatives for engaging people during the workshop. Try for example these:Use the “Conversation” option for sharing views. Ask participants to share things on their mind by writing them into conversation of online meeting. The answers will be documented automatically, and you may get back to them afterwards.
Channel’s poll for quick questions. Raise a question with defined alternatives using channel’s poll. Ask the participants to reply to the question. Share the results immediately.
Channel’s conversation for opening dialog. Raise a question or open a dialog with channel’s conversation. Ask participants to answer to the questions with reply function. Reply function keeps the discussion together.2. Start early! Share pre-tasksStart the preparations early and share pre-tasks and questionnaires to participants in advance. You may create questionnaires by Forms, one of Teams applications, and send it to the participants to fill in. The results can be shared in Teams real-time.3. Encourage the conversation! Keep the dialog ongoingKeep dialog ongoing during the meeting by thinking aloud. Keeping up the discussion is important when you are lacking an eye to eye contact with the participants. People will know they are in good hands. Also remember to utilize video whenever possible – it’s nice to see people eye-toeye! It might eat the capacity of the network if you keep it on the whole meeting. And you'll only see person who is talking. But it’s a great boost to dialogue anyway.4. Use Teams channels for organizing sub-groupsIt’s easy to use Teams’ channels for organizing sub-groups where the collaboration can go on. You may assign a channel for a sub-group to meet online, discuss, share and work documents simultaneously.Channel’s Meet now -functionality is easy for organizing meetings quickly. Participants just jump in & out.Channels are also easy for facilitators to guide sub-groups by writing instructions to the channel’s wall, or just jumping in & out to online-meeting.5. Don’t work on it alone! Enable simultaneous collaborationOften there is a need for working simultaneously a document or brainstorm a topic.Working the document together add a new template to Teams’ files. All team member can then open it and work it together simultaneously.Brainstorming is also possible with Teams. Whiteboard of Windows’ applications is brilliant for brainstorming. Participants can create post-it’s, put them onto wall and group and reorganize them. This is possible with Whiteboard. You can download it from Microsoft Shop for free.6. Don’t make it too tight! Have small breaksHave small breaks during the workshop. Breaks keep people’s energy levels high and they have energy to focus and contribute to the workshop topics. Encourage everyone to log off for a while and do something no-digital.7. Secure the success! Test it in advanceRun the workshop in advance with a colleague or by yourself. This helps you to validate the instructions for the meeting participants and to learn how well Teams supports the planned facilitation methods. Have a test for the first couple of workshops, until you know what works and doesn’t. You’ll learn more once you go on!8. Avoid “Can you hear me’s”! Optimize the experience and provide supportEncourage people to check technicalities before joining the workshop. Offer the support when needed. This will save everyone’s time when Teams, headset etc. work in everyone’s pc.Want to learn more?Check out also our free webinars:How to organize a workshop with Teams

Digitalisation and technical solutions create new opportunities for the grocery industry,/en/blog/2020/03/digitalisation-and-technical-solutions-create-new-opportunities-for-the-grocery-industry/,Data / Anni Ronkainen / 30.3.2020,"Online grocery orders complement traditional grocery salesKesko has also invested heavily in the development of its online grocery ordering service, and last year, sales in Kesko’s online service grew by over 70%.“However, we do not differentiate between our online and brick-and-mortar stores. We want to provide our customers with the complete package so that they can choose the options that suit them best,” emphasises Ronkainen.According to Ronkainen, the main obstacles to the development of Kesko’s online service have been practical in nature.“One key issue was our long delivery windows since nobody wants to be stuck at home for hours waiting for their food to be delivered. However, once we were able to introduce more specific delivery times, the feedback from our customers has been very positive.”Customers also behave differently in different countries. According to Ronkainen, Finnish consumers are particularly adamant about home deliveries.“Finnish customers are not all that keen on any order collection points, for example.”In the United Kingdom, online grocery orders account for around 7% of the grocery industry’s trade, and this figure is estimated to rise to 10% by 2023. While Ronkainen feels that it is unlikely that Finnish consumers will ever transition to purchasing all of their groceries online, it does provide them with a valuable service.“It is important that we understand our customers’ needs and how our online service can help make their lives easier. This type of service is an especially important timesaver to those living in more densely populated cities and regions.”Using data for the benefit of customersAt Kesko, data is used in various ways to provide added value to the group’s customers.“We want to be there for our customers every step of the way, from their first flash of inspiration to the final purchase,” emphasises Ronkainen.One example of this is Kesko’s recipe service, where customers can discover new ideas and options.“Our data shows that our customers like to browse through our recipes and add the ingredients they like directly to their online shopping cart. We also provide recipe recommendations for various special diets and cooking habits, which is a feature that our customers have been very vocal about.”Could data-driven personalisation go too far?According to a recent study, more than 80% of consumers are willing to provide their data for more personalised service experience.“This means that a message that has been personalised with a customer’s data is not considered a commercial message, but a service,” Ronkainen notes.According to Ronkainen, the best personalisation solutions are the ones that the consumer may never even notice.“A good example is our online store’s personalised search function, which is based on the customer’s previous behaviour and habits. Our customers consider this a feature of convenience, and I believe that the same applies to our other services as well.”Ronkainen is also quick to emphasise the responsibilities associated with data collection.“Part of our responsibility is data ethics, i.e. how data is used in an ethically correct manner. The trust that our customers place in us is important, and we definitely want to keep their trust.”Kesko understands the value of digital solutionsAt Kesko, digitalisation forms an integral part of the group’s entire business model.“We could never separate our basic functions from our digital business. Our digital development projects are not implemented separately, but as part of our overall business development,” explains Ronkainen.According to Ronkainen, Kesko has linked its data-driven efforts closely with its service development process.“Any new plans for our services are based on our customers’ activities and feedback.”The digital world also plays a major role in how Kesko interacts with its customer base.“Few people want to read paper advertisements these days, so the best way to reach them is through digital channels. Our data also shows that the people we reach online are much more valuable to us than those who do not use any digital channels,” Ronkainen notes.The future of Kesko and the grocery industryAccording to Ronkainen, Kesko is set to adopt even more advanced digital solutions and technologies in the coming years.“In addition to the potential benefits of artificial intelligence and machine learning, our future efforts will focus heavily on the use of predictive analytics.”However, the biggest change to Kesko will be the ways in which the group will need to conduct its business in the future.“We can no longer count on being just the fastest – we also need to change how we work. We need to become even more agile and eliminate all traditional boundaries within our organisation so that we can provide our customers with even more added value and at a more rapid pace than ever before,” Ronkainen concludes.This article is based on our data related podcast Tietoa tulevasta. Listen to the related episode in Finnish now!", Anni Ronkainen ,Data , 30.3.2020
When working from home became the new normal,/en/blog/2020/03/9-practical-tips-for-digital-collaboration/,Digitalization / Hanna Vuorikoski / 30.3.2020,"Some of us are already used to the opportunities the home office gives us, while for others it is a whole new way of working. New tools and training are needed. The coronavirus pandemic involves a change that none of us was fully prepared for and nor do we know how long it might last.9 practical tips for digital collaboration1. Make yourself a comfortable and cozy home office spaceIf possible, find a place at home where you can sit comfortably and mostly undisturbed. If you don’t have a room where you can close the door and work in peace, a headset is a good way of creating a calmer environment.Teams is designed so that you can work anywhere, so don’t worry about your surroundings being a little messy while you are on a video call. Plus, you can always blur the background so that the other participants cannot see what is behind you.2. Introduce set routinesIn the office, we often take regular breaks during the day, such as morning coffee, lunch and, perhaps, a coffee in the afternoon as well. At home, with no colleagues around to help us maintain these routines, we may require some more self-discipline. One useful idea is to have set routines for yourself so that you can structure your day.Do you also have children being home-schooled or needing help in other ways? Here, the extra flexibility that the home office gives you is great. But do remember to communicate your availability to colleagues throughout the day.3. Take good care of your healthWithout the pulse of office life to get you moving, you can quickly find yourself grabbing lunch at the keyboard. Make sure you take breaks – get up and make a coffee rather than having a flask at your desk, have lunch in the park if the weather is nice, or have an online coffee or lunch with your colleagues. And don’t forget to ‘go home’ when the working day is over.4. Be attentive and inclusiveDuring online meetings, it is more difficult to relay non-verbal communication. Using a camera can be a way to rectify this. Online calls with many participants can make it tricky for many to share their opinions.The meeting organizer must, therefore, be good at calling for regular breaks and asking questions, as well as reminding those on the call that they are free to share their thoughts. Another option is to set aside time for each participant in order to ensure that everyone is heard.5. Take advantage of digital collaborationDo you miss the cohesion that comes with physical meetings? This can be a major challenge, but, fortunately, we have the opportunity to conduct digital meetings in Teams. We recommend using the video whenever it’s possible, as it gives you a better sense of belonging and improves communication.At the same time, it allows us to reflect on whether a meeting is actually necessary or if it would be easier to make clarifications quickly and efficiently by using the right channels in Teams. This secluded time in our lives may actually give rise to more effective work habits.6. Record meetingsMake sure that you record important Teams meetings. Thus, those who could not make the call will have access to the same information. This is perfectly acceptable, as it can be difficult to find a time that suits everyone, especially since the home office often gives rise to additional tasks - such as helping children with schoolwork. Having a recording available means you can keep everyone on the same page.7. Keep chattingMany people who work from home find that they miss the many social benefits of working in a physical office, including informal conversations. Chatting over a cup of coffee not only helps people keep in touch but also allows for the exchange of information.It is therefore important to actively reach out to colleagues, through either the chat option or a digital meeting. Remind yourself and others to have a regular chat, phone call or video meeting in order to stay in touch with others.8. Get the team togetherFor many, working away from the office can feel isolating. As a leader, it is advisable to bring the entire team together through regular virtual meetings. In addition to online meetings, there are a number of other good interaction tools that you can use to get people together.Microsoft Office 365 has features such as file sharing, conversation, scheduling and notes, while MS Teams lets you easily share documents. For planning and task follow-ups, you can use MS Planner, which is both flexible and user-friendly. There is nothing like writing notes for yourself in everyday life and with MS OneNote, you can organize these notes and have them readily available.9.  Be creativeWith all the changes required to start working at home, it is important to keep your motivation high. Instead of leaving it to chance, there is a great deal that can be done to ensure that employees continue to feel positive and engaged.As mentioned earlier, an important measure is to keep everyone informed about what is happening – whether it is news, stories or other activities.

The success of the healthcare sector depends on how well data is collected and utilised,/en/blog/2020/03/the-success-of-the-health-care-sector-depends-on-how-well-data-is-collected-and-utilised/,Data / Visa Honkanen / 25.3.2020,"Augmenting health care with digital solutionsAccording to Honkanen, digital solutions are already used in many facets of health care.“A good example is the digital Pregnancy Pathway service, where most of our classes are arranged online.”While the service still includes face-to-face sessions, embracing more digital solutions has provided HUS with clear benefits.“For example, it is easier for both parents to participate in pregnancy coaching when it is done online,” Honkanen notes.Preventing disease with dataAt HUS, data is being increasingly used in preventative measures.“By combining health data with other data sources, we can detect the necessary warning signs and increase the efficiency of our anticipatory preventative measures,” says Honkanen.Currently, a HUS research project is investigating whether an algorithm could be used to identify people who carry rare diseases.“With machine learning, we can monitor the behaviour of various individuals in the health care system. If the algorithm detects any warning signs, it can alert the necessary experts so that they can focus their examinations on the factors that matter the most.”AI is no replacement for humansWhile AI is poised to provide clear benefits, could it also include risks, such as those related to patient safety?“At the early stages of the process, it is vital that we allow physicians to make the final call over any automated solutions. The machine conducts its analysis first, and then the physician decides what should be done,” Honkanen explains.However, according to Honkanen, the work of a physician always focuses on the management of uncertainty – a physician can rarely be absolutely certain about a diagnosis.“That’s why it would only be a good thing if machine analysis could provide us with more information.”Monitoring patients with the help of technologyHonkanen emphasises that the status of patients could be better monitored with the help of technological solutions.“For example, patients rarely finish their antibiotic regimens. That’s why it is important that we monitor why they were prescribed a certain medicine, whether the patient took it, and what happened afterwards.”While there have been discussions on the adoption of so-called smart pills, Honkanen does not wish for the health care sector to appear too overbearing in how it monitors patients.“The health care system should not become too invasive from the patient’s perspective.”Health in the cloudHUS possesses a huge repository of data. What kind of role does the cloud play in the processing of this data?“The success of the health care sector depends on how well data is collected and utilised. We would have no success in either without the help of our cloud services. Not only is the cloud the safest and fastest place to store our data, it also provides us with the most modern tools for data protection and data analysis,” explains Honkanen.According to Honkanen, another key factor in the success of data-oriented solutions is the quality of the data itself.“Even the best cloud solutions cannot save you if your data is murky at best. That’s why any larger masses of data must be cleaned up so that they can be utilised and analysed.”The quality of any piece of data is also influenced by the person inputting the data and whether the data is stored correctly.“If the person entering the data is not motivated enough, the quality of the data will suffer. That’s why we must make sure that our data depositors feel that they will benefit from using their time to enter the data.”The future of data-driven health careAccording to Honkanen, one key area for the future of the health care sector is to make use of existing data to improve the manner in which patients are treated.“The challenge for HUS is that when we provide health-related benefits to society, it does not result in any immediate changes to the Finnish economy,” he notes.“However, it is our ethical responsibility.” This article is based on our data related podcast Tietoa tulevasta. Listen to the related episode in Finnish now!", Visa Honkanen ,Data , 25.3.2020
Data is valuable only when it can benefit customers,/en/blog/2020/03/data-is-valuable-only-when-it-can-benefit-customers/,Data / Sameli Mäenpää / 20.3.2020,"Summarising the value of data with a Data Balance SheetThe financial sector is at the forefront of digitalisation, and a significant amount of data is managed by banks every single day. Since 2019, OP has summarised its data capital with a Data Balance Sheet, a new kind of report on the data that OP has at its disposal and how this data is processed, utilised and managed.“For us, the Data Balance Sheet is a strategic management tool that is strongly linked to the benefits we provide to our customers – it contains concrete examples of how data can be used to generate added value to everyone,” emphasises Mäenpää.While data protection constitutes a vital part of the Data Balance Sheet, the report does not focus solely on regulatory demands and risk management policies, but also on the benefits that can be achieved with the help of data capital.""The Data Balance Sheet contains a concrete balance sheet model that can be used to estimate the value generated by our data. In this model, one side presents the raw data capital that has been measured, while the other indicates the benefits that have been achieved with the help of this data,” Mäenpää explains.Data as capitalWhen it comes to Finnish companies and organisations, the OP Financial Group has a very significant amount of data capital at its disposal. “As a matter of fact, OP manages the largest amount of data capital in Finland right after the Finnish state,” notes Mäenpää.According to Mäenpää, the most valuable asset of today’s most successful companies is the data at their disposal. “For example, Facebook’s market value is so significant because it has access to the data of 1.5 billion people, and the same goes for LinkedIn, Amazon, Google, and so on.”While more data means more responsibility, having a significant amount of data capital provides more opportunities for creating added value to customers. At the same time, Mäenpää also wants to emphasise that data has no intrinsic value in and of itself.“Data is valuable only when it has a purpose that can be implemented at the right time and for the right customer. If a piece of data cannot be utilised when we meet a customer, be it in a physical location or online, then it has no value.”Making effective use of data capitalAt OP, data-related knowhow can be found throughout the group’s various business divisions. Sameli Mäenpää understands the importance of integrating data development practices with OP’s other business activities and their development. ""For example, we have made our strategic AI more commonplace by integrating an AI-oriented perspective into our different business processes. This will allow our staff to identify new use cases that could result in direct customer benefits.”According to Mäenpää, this emphasis on AI could be taken even further in the future. ""We’ve even thought about training our entire staff roster in the basics of AI development. This way, everyone could identify the facets of AI that would best enhance their work.”The world of financial intelligence is full of potentialOP already has several AI applications in place – although, within OP, these are referred to as ‘financial intelligence applications’. Some examples of these include OP’s customer chatbot and an automated credit decision service that customers can use to obtain a home loan decision right after seeing a potential house. In addition, OP has developed an advanced mobile service that people can use to manage their personal finances: the service automatically categorizes different transactions and recurring revenue streams with the help of AI.And what does the future of the financial intelligence world look like? “I believe that a lot will happen in the world of artificial intelligence and data, and one great example of this is image analysis,” Mäenpää notes and explains how an automated damage detection and case processing service could benefit OP’s insurance arm: “If you ever had an accident, all you’d have to do is take a picture, send it to us, and we could initiate the damage compensation process without having to send anyone out to verify the damage.”Mäenpää emphasises that a responsible actor is one that uses data for the benefit of its customers.“Above all, we want to make our customers’ lives easier and help them achieve their goals.”This article is based on our data related podcast Tietoa tulevasta.

Do you leave your keys behind the doorframe? Tips for building a digital safe,/en/blog/2020/03/tips-for-building-a-digital-safe/,Cybersecurity insights / Leif Blocksjö / 18.3.2020,"They've got all the information they need from their friend, Johan Isaksson, who knows about the security precautions at the bank. Planning has been done and it is time to do the crime.Nils extends his hand behind the door frame where the key to the front door is stored. They both quickly enter. Once inside, Lars the blacksmith begins his work. He manages to open the door to the safe.The next morning, the staff finds the bank safe open. In it are only a few coins and a note with a taunting poem. The burglars get away with 850,000 riksdalers, about 4-8 million Euro in today's monetary value, making the robbery one of the largest in Sweden’s history. Some say that it is surpassed first by the Great Train Robbery in England 1963The authorities in Linköping are perplexed. They ask for help from the neighbouring police district’s (Norrköping) own Sherlock Holmes, Police Commissioner H.M Larsson. Larsson visits Linköping's taverns and pubs disguised as an ox trader. He finds clues which lead to the arrest of the criminals. The loot was, for the most part, found, buried in a kitchen garden not far away.While entertaining and historically true, the above story has important lessons for us working with protecting digital data. As key learnings, I would list the following:Be careful how you handle user information and digital keys (do not hide them above the door frame)
Be sure to have detective controls in place (the bank was missing alarm functionality so the burglars could work undisturbed for an extended period)
Make sure you have a strong digital safe that requires time and effort to crack. (A blacksmith's tools should not be enough.)A look at physical and digital securityPhysical security often consists of a protective shell, an alarm zone and a safe. This concept translates quite well into our world of digital security.Comparing physical and digital security, you could say that Next-Generation Firewalls, email protection and strong endpoint protection etc. correspond to the shell protection (walls, doors and external locks) in the physical world. But, since competent criminals can get inside the shell, we need a place in the IT environment where security is at an even higher level – the digital safe.It is more cost-effective to secure a small amount of the most valuable data/assets than to secure all data/assets in the organization.What is a digital safe?Today, almost all data is digital. Most organizations have data that needs to be protected to prevent damage or financial loss. It may be financial data, data relating to the security of the nation, personal data, or trade secrets.When we collect this sensitive data and place it in one specific place in the IT-environment, restrict access and take necessary security precautions to secure it – thus you have a digital safe.If you are a rare case, an organization which has only public data, then you do not need a digital safe. However, you still need to protect your infrastructure so that you are not exposed to sabotage.To build a digital safe, the important thing is to not think only about technology; routines and policies need to be in place as well. The following list can be used as a checklist for first steps when building your digital safe.Controlled and restricted network access to the infrastructure of the safe.
Detective controls that provide visibility to discover any unauthorized attempts.
Routines/scripts in place stopping unauthorized persons from getting in.
A proxy or jump point that prevents direct contact by the safe with possibly infected computers.
Restricted access, so only employees with an absolute need can access the safe
Insurance that the keys to the safe are safe, ie. not found in other infrastructure, eg. identities and other forms of digital keys
Checks that the keys to the safehold an appropriate level of security for what you want to protect
Insurance that the safe itself is protected with a stronger technology than the one you use in the shell protection. (Ex. encryption, whitelisting, hardening and IAM technology)
Verification that those who serve the infrastructure can in no way access the secure information
Verification that the protection works and is active (ex. penetration tests and vulnerability scanning)
Logging of access and alarms; that someone/something controls the logging and routines are in place if the logging stops working.
Insurance that the logs have a retention time, matching your compliance demands.
Checks that backups are done, and that backup data will not become a security risk.
Verification that the infrastructure in the digital safe is protected from unauthorized physical access and external environment threats, for example, fire.Do you have a need for a digital safe? TietoEVRY can help with pre-packaged digital safes, adapted to different forms of data where the cost is adjusted to what you need to protect.PS. We also have a SOC (Security Operations Center) with highly skilled security analysts. One of them is called Larsson just like the police commissioner in history, but he is not from Norrköping.Further reading:Develop Cyber Resilient Systems (NIST.SP.800-160v2)https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-160v2.pdfGuide to Application Whitelisting (NIST.SP.800-167)https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-167.pdfICSA Guide to Cryptography by Randell K.NicholsDigital Identity Guidelines (NIST.SP.800-63)https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/", Leif Blocksjö ,Cybersecurity insights , 18.3.2020
Retention: Five ways to keep your bank customers and their loans,/en/blog/2020/03/retention-five-ways-to-keep-your-bank-customers-and-their-loans/,Data / Jenny Grahn / 17.3.2020,"Why should a loan customer choose to stay with you? In a world where intelligent technology and open banking are changing the landscape of financial services, every company needs to be able to answer this question – or risk losing business.But even as technology changes, people are still people, so if you make them feel valued and give them a reason to stay, many will. Companies can no longer wait until a customer has one foot out the door to try and change their mind – retention must be built into the entire service proposition from day one.1. Proactivity pays offRetention is not only about keeping the customers that want to leave, it’s about keeping the customers you have, and given that it costs a business more to onboard new customers than it does to keep existing ones – it’s essential. You don’t always have to have the best interest rate either. It’s making sure customers are treated well, that they are happy with their loans and the service they receive.Proactively offering customers better value for money before they knew they were looking for a better deal can go a long way to creating customer loyalty. We need to talk to customers, find out how they feel about the loan or credit they have. Do they need to consolidate other debts to save on repayments? Do they need to borrow additional funds or change the term of their current loan? A company’s efforts to consistently give their customers a good deal goes a long way to creating customer loyalty.2. Catching customers before they fallIf a customer has an overdue invoice, it’s a prime time to get in touch make sure they have everything they need to make the payment. Maybe there is a reason they couldn’t make the payment this time, and it’s better to understand that as quickly as possible. We try to not only help the customer avoid additional fees and charges that they might face if they continue to miss payments, but also to help them get back on track and remain a profitable customer, who feels the company has done their best to look after them.3. Stopping the switchersIn a highly competitive market, some customers will always have their heads turned by seemingly better deals, so it’s impossible to avoid getting some cancellation calls. But what’s important is how they are handled, and leveraging the good relationship the customer already has with you to help them stay.When we work with inbound termination calls, you need to quickly establish the reason behind it – have they seen a better deal elsewhere, have they come into some money and want to pay off the loan, or have they had a bad experience?We work with every termination call to try and keep the customer, to see if we can offer them something better or understand how we can help them. If we can, they will probably stay.4. Having the right resourceA well-resourced team of specialists is essential to efficiently handle retention – proactively and reactively. This might sound obvious, but having the right resource to handle fluctuating call volumes can cause a big headache for many businesses who are sensitive to large spikes in inbound call volumes.I’ve never heard of a customer that likes to be kept waiting, and efficient and timely call handling can help keep customer satisfaction at a high level.We are driven not only by keeping the end customer happy, but to also by helping our customers to be successful. Having a long-serving team of specialists, and being able to efficiently steer call handlers to where they are needed most in reaction to call volumes, plays a big part in this.5. Measuring your serviceUnderstanding how your customers feel about the service they receive is a solid way of helping to keep their business. Getting customers to evaluate your calls against parameters like engagement, simplicity, knowledge, problem solving, general satisfaction and answer time, can help you see where your retention efforts might be falling down – or exceeding.When employees can directly access customer feedback, it can help them to see what works and what doesn’t work so well when they feel they’ve had a particularly good or bad call. Working towards customer scores being kept consistently high is essential, for staff morale as well as customer retention.Using platform Brilliant Future, and taking an average of the six parameters above, we work to ensure that our customer satisfaction scores remain consistently ahead of our peers in financial services.The result?Regular customer contact at the right moment in time is key. If customers value what you do for them, they will be happy from the start – and will be more likely to stay until the end.Find out more about TietoEVRY’s Financial BPO service and how it can help you keep more customers.Related reading10 Do's and Don’ts with Net Promoter ScoreTietoEVRY Credit Solutions awarded in Best Customer Service – Financial Services category", Jenny Grahn ,Data , 17.3.2020
Artificial intelligence and machine learning enable major savings in the pulp and paper industry,/en/blog/2020/03/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-enable-major-savings-in-the-pulp-and-paper-industry/,Data / Antti Blomqvist  / 16.3.2020,"Last year, we wrote in our blog how the pulp & paper industry needs to renew and look for major savings potential. This will happen by automating mainly manual business processes in the offices and enabling operator mobility at shop-floor level. We assumed that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are the drivers of the change. Let’s take a quick look where we are today in this inevitable change.Can AI run a paper machine better than humans?Many companies are developing data lake-based solutions, where they collect data from automation, mill execution and ERP systems. Data maintenance and modelling, however, need to be solved before the data becomes practically useful. Obstacles include unharmonised master data or missing domain knowledge. How to cope with huge amounts of process data from multiple automation systems is another issue.Analytics scalability needs looking at. What works on one machine may not work on another. Therefore, models need to be self-learning, using long-term historical data to learn correctly. If the model, for example, does not know the quality of raw materials used, self-learning algorithms are missing essential information leading to wrong decisions.How to make top-down analytics and bottom-up automation meet?While analytics services progress as IT initiatives from the top down, automation suppliers are approaching the issue from the bottom up. They typically focus on a specific machine or machines and usually do not cover the complete production line.Quality controllers today are not designed to optimise both quality and cost, as they do not have the information to do it. This is where major cost savings potential is hiding: optimisers on different levels feed their information to automation to enable holistically optimised production.As AI and ML go forward and start to provide reliable results, the next step is to hook algorithms into active process control. This requires standard API interfaces and services across multivendor environments.Towards continuous planningMany companies today focus on their future digital core – “ERP version 2” – struggling with two topics:Which business processes should be standard and which ones are industry or company specific?
 Which services are run in the cloud, preferably as a service, and which ones are needed on-premise to provide business continuity?There is no single correct answer. Every company needs to figure out what the best solution is for their strategy and operational efficiency.As business processes will be more and more automated, we are moving towards “continuous planning” instead of the present “plan and execute” model. Continuous and automated planning enable production in future to accept new orders in the middle of a production run or automatically re-optimise the run with the latest orders.This is important for architecture since continuous planning requires complex interfaces in an area where no integration standards exist. The optimisation potential can be realised by combining information from several systems and integrating this into active production control.Local MES (Edge) enables automation to optimise production with full visibility into incoming materials and optimised settings to fulfil business targets. It then transfers the production outcome to the next production step with re-optimised targets.Human involvement only where neededThe long-term target, besides continuous process optimisation, now seems to be to enable operator mobility. In future, the systems take care of standard events without operator involvement.Incoming raw materials are automatically identified, produced units are automatically labelled, optimal production sizes are automatically calculated and sent to automation, produced waste is automatically detected and connected to produced units.Do we in future need full-time winder operators or can operators do something else while the machine does the routine work? Raw materials can be automatically transferred to the correct machines at the correct time. When something goes wrong or operator decisions are needed, the system will ask the operator for support through mobile.It’s a long race, but the prize is worth itThe road to fully automated, self-learning production chains is still long and somewhat winding. There are no shortcuts. TietoEVRY’s industry expertise, integration competencies and process management knowledge help you create a platform on top of which specific solutions can be built to make use of data.In 2020, we continue working towards major costs savings, providing value and even better customer service for the complete pulp & paper industry value chain.Read more of our solutions", Antti Blomqvist  ,Data , 16.3.2020
Guest blog post: 10 Do's and Don’ts with Net Promoter Score,/en/blog/2020/03/10-dos-and-donts-with-net-promoter-score/,Data / Anneli Malaguti / 11.3.2020,"5 Do’s when working with NPS1. Act on the feedback and close the loopThe most essential is to do something with the data you collect. Acting on the feedback you receive from your customers shows that you care and want the best for your customers. Closing the loop is about calling customers and understanding the root cause of them being either a detractor, passive or promoter. Most customers are positively surprised that you call them and want to listen to them even more, customers also want you to understand and change. Another way of acting on the feedback is to look at the answers on the aggregated level and improve the areas that most customers say you should improve or change. The changes must be prioritized after what would be beneficial for most customers or your most important customers.2. CommunicateTo the customers so they know what you will improve. This can prevent them from leaving you. If they know that you will change something that they are dissatisfied with today, they are more likely to stay.3. Compare with a relevant benchmarkYou must compare your NPS value with similar companies when analyzing your business NPS. A lot of differences can be seen between industries, B2B/B2C, type of product/service and the way you measure NPS. Always compare Relationship NPS with the same and Transactional NPS with Transactional NPS and try to minimize the misleading comparisons.4. Building economic proofDoing an economic exercise with your customer feedback can create a stronger buy-in from your decision-makers and the whole organization. You will create a common view of the importance of the customer's voice and how much is at risk in your customer relations. This will definitively drive actions to a paralyzed situation.5. Involve the whole organizationMake sure the customer's voice doesn’t stop in marketing or on general management levels. Make the feedback visible for all employees both front line and back end. With this input, employees can adapt and explore the best ways of handling the customers. They can discuss and share best practices and set a common framework for successful key behaviors and service in customer meetings. In a strong customer-centric business, all know how to contribute.5 Don’ts when working with NPS1. Overuse the NPSMany times we tend to include the NPS question in all surveys and all touchpoints. We fall in love with the concept and think that this will predict customers’ behavior just by asking the question to the customers. Instead of overusing the NPS question, aim to have the question in the correct place. Ask the NPS question primary in relationship surveys to have an overall view of the experience connected to your company and brand.2. Using transaction NPS as the target for the whole companyAvoid using NPS as a quality target for the whole company only using data from one exclusive function or touchpoint. Since the likeliness to recommend lies in the whole experience with a company and not one single interaction, it is easy to be misled in attempts to link to financial results using NPS in that way. For functions such as customer service, it is relevant to ask the NPS question (sometimes because this is the only way), however, instead of targeting on the transaction NPS use NPS in transaction surveys as an early warning system to alert specific members of the team to take fast actions. For example, it can give you fast information if your systems are down, something unexpected happened on the market, product faults or unclarity in any of the other touchpoints. Quality targets on customer service or other functions should instead be set by the level of satisfaction in this service.3. Individual compensation on NPSWhen we use NPS as qualitative metrics for a certain function it seems natural to align this with individual goals to make sure employees know how they can contribute. However, since the NPS score is about evaluating the whole customer journey, employees in one function won’t be the only ones impacting the NPS. Compensating employees should, therefore, be on their performance and on things they can control. If you want to set a bonus on NPS, it is better to set targets on a higher level like function or company level.4. Treat all customers the sameAvoid seeing all customers as equal and that you can create the same experience to all. Instead, focus on segmenting the customers based on value for your business and into NPS categories. If you have the NPS score for customers, it is relevant to understand what expectations each segment has, the value they create for you and what revenue is at stake. This will ensure the right decisions are taken based on the customer's voice and can also help to prioritize resources.5. Customize the NPS methodologyMany times we meet companies that want to measure NPS and understand the level of loyalty of their customers, however, they want to change the question, the scale, the phrasing, and other things because they believe that it does not match their business. The NPS is sometimes questioned because of the recommendation to “a friend” and sometimes also the mismatch in the middle value and share of passives. It is important to emphasize that the moment you change the question, scale format, etc. you lose the essence of the methodology and you won’t have a clear benchmark to compare your business with. So, don’t customize the NPS methodology!Related readingRetention: Five ways to keep your bank customers and their loansTietoEVRY Credit Solutions awarded in Best Customer Service – Financial Services categoryCustomer experience trends in the banking industry in 2020---Brilliant Future is one of the market's foremost data-driven survey and insight platforms for customer and employee experiences.

Time to integrate into Public Cloud?,/en/blog/2020/03/on-a-mission-to-integrate-the-public-cloud-into-all-of-tietoevry/,Cloud / Harri Kallioniemi / 6.3.2020,"We have a strong mandate to make the Public Cloud one of our core strengths. This is no internal start-up or trial period – we mean business. And actually, we just announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft with the intent to have 3000 people certified in Azure. This is how serious we are about the Public Cloud.I have been in awe of how much cloud competence there is already in TietoEVRY. We truly have some exceptionally competent people here – experts any organization would be jumping up and down to have. With this skill base, it’s much easier to start tackling the next challenge – the transformation of how we deliver solutions to customers.To me, the Public Cloud is not a technology, but a new way of delivering IT services. But in order to achieve that, you must challenge yourself and foremost unlearn past truths and practices.Let me put it this way, it is typically much easier to set up a unit of area experts than to drive change in an entire organization. Understandably, not all of our around 24,000 people are yet familiar with the Public Cloud and its many benefits. This growth journey is about making a change through every encounter and discussion – teaching and learning from others.The Public Cloud is both mature and constantly developingWhat is also exciting about the Public Cloud is that it’s still developing constantly. Public Cloud adoption started in cloud native application development areas. But now it has moved to transforming traditional IT to address core business problems, including for example SAP on cloud and how manufacturing sites in remote places can be moved to cloud.This is where TietoEVRY really shines, understanding both old and new uses across the entire spectrum of IT services – and this is where the real impact can be made.Learn more: 50 unique benefits for utilizing Public Cloud as SAP platformWe champion diversity and growth mindsetIt is hard to miss the increasing discussion of modern leadership – the basic notion of putting people first and trusting that this also delivers better business results. This is not a new area inside TietoEVRY, with some of our most successful units already fully embracing this approach. This is also where we’re going with the Public Cloud unit.If I had to pick three terms to describe working here, they would be empowering, iterative and expert-led. This spirit is also captured by something I have repeated in recruitment interviews with talents: “You won’t be doing exactly the same thing in 12 months”. Development and a growth mindset are essential here.There’s a big question we cloud experts are constantly asking each other: what is the next phase of cloud development? There seems to be a strong understanding that the cloud is shifting from digital applications to transforming traditional IT infrastructure.So, for cloud experts interested in their next career phase there’s another key question: what organizations can actually make these transformations happen?

What is Edge Computing and EdgeAI?,/en/blog/2020/03/what-is-edge-computing-and-edgeai/,Data / Emmanuel Raj / 5.3.2020,"Edge computing technology is now emerging to meet this demand. It involves placing computing resources closer to where data originates (i.e.  motors, pumps, generators, or other sensors).Edge Computing  is the process of performing computing tasks physically close to target devices, rather than in the cloud or on the device itself. Over the past decades we’ve seen different architectural patterns for systems. Depending on the bottleneck of the system, they were designed as centralized or decentralized systems. The growing amount of data (IoT) and the limitations of the networking layer (and computation) lead to a decentralized system like Edge Computing.In lay terms it can be compared to eating locally produced food. While steaks from Argentina are delicious, transporting them over a huge distance leads to increased CO2 emissions, and it takes a lot of time. Furthermore, the origin of the meat is much more difficult to track, and different standards for animal rights may apply. While these circumstances do not directly translate to the digital world, the line of reasoning is similar.EdgeAI: Machine Learning at the edgeEdge computing offers huge potential to make it possible to apply different machine learning algorithms at the edge. It will enable new kinds of experiences and new kinds of opportunities in many industries ranging from Mobile and Connected Homes to Security, Surveillance, and Automotive.The advantages of Machine Learning at the Edge are the following:1. Better Latency:If applications depend on immediate feedback (e.g. to make “real-time” decisions), sending data to the cloud, calculating and sending the data back to the device may take too long. However, if the path is reduced to the (much closer) Edge Device or Node and back, many use cases can be realised faster.2. Hyper Personalization:Devices (IoT) can be in different environments and locations, and they might need to perform tasks customised to their respective environments. In such cases Edge Devices or Nodes can enable customisation for each device as in a custom machine learning (ML) model for each device performing real-time inference at close proximity. Also, this way ML models deployed at the edge can optimize and retrain when needed, constantly learning to serve better. This is limited and not possible on scale in the Cloud.3. Data throughput and pruning:Devices can produce enormous amounts of data. For example, one autonomous car can produce up to 4000 gigabytes per day. If every single car sent all its data to central data centres, it would create a huge load on the network. By performing the necessary computations on Edge Nodes close to the device, most of the path can be pruned. This is especially important when considering the increasing importance of the internet of things and the rising number of devices connected to the internet.4. Reliability and Robustness:The main functionality of devices should still be available, even if communications to the central cloud are impaired. This can be achieved by relying on local communication with an Edge Node which should (at least in theory) be less prone to problems. If an Edge Node fails, the devices will be shifted to an alternative Edge Node.5. Stronger Hardware:In today’s world many applications rely on very strong or specialized hardware. Modern machine learning algorithms, for example, work best with GPUs or tensor processing units (TPUs). Extending devices with such hardware is generally not desirable. Edge Devices or Nodes are preferable for such specialized hardware and hardware with more computing power in general.6. Privacy:In many use cases collecting user data is required or at least useful. However, in cases where aggregated data is sufficient, the users’ privacy can be preserved by aggregating the data on the Edge Node instead of the cloud.7. Scalability:In most cases the computing power of devices is limited by their small size. Furthermore, developing a new use case that requires stronger hardware will require all possible users or the network administrator to update the devices, which limits the use cases’ adoption rate. Edge Nodes do not suffer from these problems and can be extended both very easily and continuously. Using a suitable Edge Computing framework, adding, replacing or upgrading Edge Nodes is a very simple and highly automated process.8. Adaptability:Using an Edge Device or Node instead of a single purpose server has the added benefit of being adaptable to changing circumstances. After enabling a base environment,  Edge Devices or Nodes can be easily configured to provide individual subsets of services, depending on the environment. While some use cases are only useful in cities, others may be more beneficial in rural areas. Due to the direct connection to the cloud and higher-level Edge Nodes, moving workloads and freeing up computing power for critical use cases is possible and it can be done on the fly.9. Sustainability and Cost reduction:Devices are producing enormous amounts of data. One single autonomous car for example may produce up to 4000 gigabytes per day. If every single car sent all the data that it generates all the way to the cloud for Machine Learning inference, it would create a huge  load on the network – and the  electricity consumption  to serve these requests would be tremendous, which in turn would also result in huge costs for Businesses. Instead outsourcing and taking Machine Learning inference and data pruning at the data origin/location  on the edge will exponentially decrease costs and enable sustainable business.With these advantages we are set to witness more and more adoption of AI in the edge towards a connected and robust world. For some time, I have been doing hands-on Research and Development on  Intelligent edge and cloud - Continuous deployment for Machine Learning.  Thanks for support from my team (AI Team at TietoEvry),  VTT Finland,  Arcada University, and Mentors. More updates will follow, so stay tuned.

They are attending the onboarding days where they get to learn more about the company and meet their new colleagues.“Having recently moved to Norway, the onboarding days are helpful to me in understanding the business culture here. I heard from friends already working here that this is a good place to work, with interesting projects and a variety of technologies. This made TietoEVRY appealing.” says Shefali Sharma, newly hired Integration Consultant from India.We are always looking for new talent – would you fit in?The newly recruited employees attending the Take Off days in Fornebu come from a number of different countries. They will work at different TietoEVRY offices spread across Norway. Most of them have a tech-related background, the other new joiners represent economists, project leaders, human resources, and more. Some are straight out of higher education while others have years of experience in the IT industry. TietoEVRY needs all of them.“Ever since I was an undergrad student at OsloMet, I have heard a lot of good things about TietoEVRY. They were always present at job fairs and the campus, known as a good place to work.” Says Arthika Surendran, newly hired Network Delivery Manager.Having attended the onboarding day, one statement stuck with her:“We were told, “welcome to freedom!” – we are encouraged to be ourselves at work. If you really like Mickey Mouse, no one will stop you from wearing a Mickey Mouse t-shirt. It’s quite informal compared to many other companies.”Arthika Surendran (left) and Shefali Sharma (right) on their first day at TietoEVRY.How do we recruit the best?TietoEVRY is in constant need of new talent. Succeeding as a company means succeeding with the people working there. This is why TietoEVRY is always looking for new people to recruit, to attract the most competent tech people from all over the world.We focus on three things to attract the right people:Employer brand: At the core of the recruitment process and communication with potential candidates is the candidate experience. We need to have a process that is candidate-oriented and perceived as fair, transparent and relevant. That is why we are the first Nordic company to use gamification on a big scale when recruiting graduates and interns. When candidates actually meet us face-to-face, we can focus on getting to know each other.Transparency: We have a recruitment process that is fair, objective and relevant.Efficiency: Recruiting must be highly automated and data-driven– when handling thousands of applicants, we need an automated approach.We are looking for employees who are people-oriented, able to handle and complete work assignments, collaborate with others, and build relationships.Would you like to join us?

It gives candidates a more positive experience and can provide us with better data on the individual's personality,"" explains Anna Gulliksen, Head of Talent Management and Recruitment in TietoEVRY's HR department.So how does gamified aptitude testing actually work?Candidates are given a link to a test which they can download on their tablets or smartphones.""The first stage measures candidates' general problem-solving abilities and their ability to make decisions based on figures and statistics,"" Anna explains.Does this mean that anyone interested in working at TietoEVRY now has to play computer games to have a chance of getting a job?""No, there's no evidence to suggest that people who have played computer games have an advantage in our tests; everyone has the same chance to succeed. The environment and context should resemble the playful aspect we experience from computer games, but what we measure is cognitive ability and abstract thinking.""The fact that TietoEVRY is the first in the Nordic region to test gamified aptitude testing on a large scale makes it even more exciting. We use the method in recruitment processes for our graduate programme, among other things. A total of 1,400 applications to five different locations in Norway and Sweden resulted in 100 new graduates who are due to start in September. 40% of them are women.""It's really important that we have a process that is objective, fair and unbiased. We individuals are always subjective, so we must be able to weigh up for that by using objective tools. These tools generate diversity in terms of both nationality and gender.

Baloise: How the Belgian insurer is kick-starting its digitization journey,/en/blog/2020/02/baloise-how-the-Belgian-insurer-is-kick-starting-its-digitization-journey/,Data / Sameer Datye / 7.2.2020,"In fact, the Belgian economy, or rather the Belgian society as a whole is in the midst of a massive digitalization program that would have far reaching consequences. Unostentatiously named “Digital Belgium” the program is laying the bulwark for a long-term digital vision with 5 clear priorities:Figure 1: Digital Belgium – The five prioritiesIt would be naïve therefore to think that Baloise Insurance which is at the fulcrum of the Belgian Insurance sector would be unaffected by the Digitization winds blowing all around.I had a tête-à-tête with Noël Pauwels (Managing Director Non-Life Retail), Jan Strauven (Director Digital Transformation), Veerle Desmet (Director Digital Business & Partnerships) & Joris Smeulders (CIO) to learn more about how Baloise is responding to the shifts in the insurance sector brought about by the Digitization wave. The following is an extract from the interview.With the digital revolution, what are the main trends that you see in the Belgian Insurance sector?Noël: The impact of digitization is everywhere. Buying habits are moving online. Mobile phones are now the preferred choice of digital engagement. Personal mobility choices are increasing. Health and wellness investment are not an exception, but a new normal. Traditional channels are not disappearing but are supplemented with new channels. The digital society has new products, services and businesses.Jan: Let me add on to this. I would say we can identify 5 major trends in Belgium:The customers are increasingly interested in the new type of eco system services. Almost 70% customers are willing to embrace the digital revolution.
Almost 50% customers have clearly indicated a preference for unstructured or email communication highlighting a clear opportunity for insurers to further optimize their digital channels and improve efficiency.
The Belgian Insurance market is still fragmented though life insurance is undergoing consolidation.
Digitalization of insurance channels is happening though intermediaries are still popular.
The “challengers” or the “digital start-ups” with no baggage from the past, no tradition or cultural shackles are using technology to disrupt the market and the ‘Incumbent’ players have to basically change or perish.And Baloise, as  an obvious ‘Incumbent’ has to respond to this aggressively?Joris: Yes and as one we have already taken big steps to confront this tiger.  A three-pronged ‘Prepare for the future’ strategy which encompasses three broad components is already operational on the ground:Noël: Let me elaborate this more. If you see these three components - it starts with Innovation and learning as its central theme. Building on this we have two complementary but separate tracks: Growing the core insurance to handle the new paradigm and preparing for the future with whacky techie innovations.What you mean is - Making your core insurance ‘future ready’ as a base, and then adding the new technology accelerators - Something on those lines?Joris: Yes as an incumbent that is the most sensible policy. Like for e.g. in our core insurance, we have invested in Insurance-in-a-Box, our agile insurance platform to ensure that we have a very high level of flexibility and maneuverability to address the new business models and ideas. This in turn will help our broker community in their own respective digital ambitions. A win-win for all.  That is somewhat like having a crunchy base of the pizza and then we add the toppings 😊Veerle: And in the ‘toppings’ we are investing with examples like Mobly for mobility & B-Tonic for health and wellness, Qover for digital experiences etc. These are services that are designed to help our customers on the private as well as commercial side to cope with the changing forms of life.Will that not disrupt your existing channels though?Jan: Not really. We don’t see as a X or Y kind of a situation. Rather it's X + Y.  Belgian customers still prefer the bouquet approach of Insurance where the Broker does a mix and match of insurances to give a customized solution to the customer. Our agile insurance would enable the brokers to do this digitally and do this very fast. They will not only be able to meet the customers face-to-face, but also support them digitally.Veerle: We mention this many a time and its worth repeating. Our moto is Digital when possible, Always human.So, nimbleness is a key component of your core solution?Joris: Absolutely. The time when the time to market for new products was in ‘years’ is over. Now we measure it in months. The core insurance has not just to be sturdy and dependable it has to be extremely nimble and future ready to churn out a steady stream of new age product offerings and do that very fast.--------The most notable take-away from our discussion was that Baloise is adapting to this challenge not by an impulsive ‘change policy’. The structured approach of making their core insurance what they call ‘Future Ready’ and then adding on the cherries on the cake is somewhat like having your cake and eating it too...Baloise’s Agile Insurance Initiative is powered by the Insurance-in-a-Box [iiB] platform, an open ecosystem initiative by TietoEVRY.

Protecting information instead of devices,/en/blog/2020/02/protecting-information-instead-of-devices/,Cybersecurity insights / Tietoevry at your service / 6.2.2020,"This calls for a change – from protecting infrastructure to protecting the information itself.Traditional protection methods – firewalls, endpoint protection, and different flavours of intrusion prevention systems – have relied on explicit knowledge of the infrastructure topology in order to detect and block malicious behaviour. This approach is rapidly becoming obsolete with the advent of ephemeral infrastructure, where servers, storage pools and even networks come and go at sub-minute timescales. Today, any reliance on static, infrastructure-level protection is largely hit-and-miss.All is not lost, however. By turning our attention to the information itself, we can shift our focus back to what matters. In many ways, the currently popular so-called zero-trust architectures are a good match for protecting dynamic public cloud environments. As defined in practise by e.g. Google in their BeyondCorp and, more recently, BeyondProd concepts, access control with no reliance on a trusted network is a step in the right direction. Such approaches, however, require wholesale commitment and investment from the entire organization – something not easily attainable in real life.For most organizations, a more grounded approach may well be to start from the other end. One such approach is transparent encryption. Essentially, this means that the information residing in public clouds is encrypted, with decryption keys allocated based on existing IAM roles. Transparent encryption differs from e.g. full disk encryption in that the file metadata remains visible to admins, allowing them to perform activities as before, while the file contents are only readable only with the correct set of keys.This, as some readers probably have already noticed, moves the problem from protecting data access to protecting access to the keys.There are essentially three different types of encryption schemes available for public clouds;Native encryption: Every public cloud platform offers data encryption as a standard feature. In the simplest form, the cloud provider creates an encryption key when the subscription is created, and all assets are then encrypted with this key. In most cases, the key is held with a Key Management System (KMS) with the cloud provider. While this approach is more than enough for most users, it does rely on the cloud provider to maintain the confidentiality of the encryption key.   
Bring Your Own Key (BYOK): Some use cases may require the cloud user to create and maintain their own keys. This model is supported by all major cloud providers, allowing users to store the keys either on-platform using shared or dedicated KMS, or, in some cases, to even have their own off-platform KMS. The latter model creates an almost complete disconnect from the cloud provider but places significant demands on the user organization to perform proper key management practices – a task that is more complex than it may initially seem to be.   
Bring Your Own Encryption (BYOE): For some extreme use cases, some cloud providers allow users to plug in their own encryption algorithms in addition to keys. While it is not advisable for anyone to roll their own algorithms, certain regulatory regimes may put specific requirements on the strength of encryption and/or require proprietary cryptosystems to be used. BYOE allows these requirements to be fulfilled, albeit often with a significantly higher administrative burden on the user.Whichever model of encryption is chosen, each provides reasonable assurance that only authorized users, whether human or machine, can access the protected information. For public cloud environments, the use of a proper encryption regime can also be automatically enforced in policies across all deployed assets.As computing and storage assets and even entire infrastructures become more dynamic, with lifetimes ranging from milliseconds to hours, information protection must move closer to the information itself. A well-designed encryption regime offers several benefits over traditional infrastructure-based controls. It also provides a perfect stepping stone towards zero-trust architectures, should that be the future direction of your organization. Want to hear more? Watch the recording of our webinar and learn how to to build cybersecurity into the DNA of cloud-native applications.", Tietoevry at your service ,Cybersecurity insights , 6.2.2020
Metadata management – the often-neglected discipline that can boost your success,/en/blog/2020/01/metadata-management/,Data / Hanna Kleemola / 31.1.2020,"A lot of time is wasted in organizations due to the lack of metadata management. Think about going to the library to borrow the latest novel you are eager to read. But imagine all the books are in random order – without information about genres or authors. This means the entire library has no metadata information. Good luck finding what you are looking for – you won’t. This example applies to an organization’s data also: without metadata – data that describes data – you do not understand what data you have and where to find it. As data volumes and complexity grow exponentially, the criticality of easily available metadata also increases.Active metadata management increases the value organizations can extract from their data. It reduces time spent searching for data, improves data quality, speeds up development and improves communication between business and IT and enables collaboration between all data users – not to mention improving operations and increasing cost-efficiency. It also supports achieving legal and regulatory compliance by design (e.g. GDPR or BCBS239 for banking).Common business vocabulary and documentation helps form a solid data foundationIt is essential to document any critical data. Data and its documentation are intended to be shared and reused; therefore, it is important to foster common ways of understanding, finding, using and treating data across the organization, instead of creating silos.Let’s start with how to understand what data means from a business perspective. The key here is setting up business definitions for data and documenting them in a business glossary, serving as an organization’s common language. Documentation work can be top-down or bottom-up – or even tackled with a hybrid approach. The best approach depends on the organization and what makes sense in their unique situation.Managing the information that makes data meaningful is at the core of data governance, which aims for data to be seen and managed as a strategic asset, as my colleague Ritva Aula detailed in her recent blog post. As a result, the metadata – the common business knowledge such as definitions, classifications, rules and roles – is transparent to everyone, which helps to streamline reporting, analytics, data protection and all other data initiatives.A business glossary is a way to understand the business meaning of data, but it alone does not help in finding the data for consumption. The technical documentation details must also be captured and linked to the business glossary to explain what a specific piece of data means and where it is physically located.Data cataloguing tools accelerate metadata creation and maintenanceDocumenting each piece of data from thousands of databases, let alone maintaining them all, is impossible to accomplish manually. Data cataloguing tools provide capabilities that scan through data content to discover and collect metadata automatically and enable active metadata management. Sample data and machine learning are utilized to match the data with the right business meaning. Data flows, transformations and authoritative sources are part of metadata documentation, ensuring that the right data is used and re-used, from a single source – rather than creating overlapping datasets and data silos in which the same data is stored numerous times across different locations for different units, teams and so on.Information about horizontal lineages, i.e. the data flows from source to target, support impact analysis for regression testing and vice versa, root cause analysis to address issues. Documentation of vertical lineages, i.e. the linkages from business meaning to user interface language to database names, enables understanding the data and the requirements related to it – whether your approach is top down to create new data or bottom up to understand existing data.Data catalogues as common collaboration platformsEven the best data cataloguing tool cannot replace people. However, a catalogue can be used as a shared workspace for everyone managing or using data, which prevents silos and working in isolation. With a collaboration platform, the automatically collected metadata can be enhanced by information that resides only in people’s minds via experience, ensuring that the information is not lost, even when people leave the organization. Sharing data and metadata helps to answer data users’ questions and to ensure not only the efficient use but also re-use of data, eliminating the need for different data stakeholders to repeat the same searches, analyses, or reporting, unaware of each other’s work.Get started to extract the most value out of your dataThe maturity of metadata management is still low in the Nordics. Apart from banks and a few other exceptions, businesses do not fully understand the potential impacts of metadata on cost-effectiveness, speed and agility in their operations. At the same time, metadata management and data cataloguing tools are rapidly developing to make the job easier – presenting opportunities for companies to step up their game to create competitive advantages with data.Whatever the trigger for your organization is – regulatory requirements, data quality issues, analytics (AI/ML) – use it as an accelerator to get started, prioritize and aim for a robust data catalogue that allows you to realize the benefits and value of all of it – based on enterprise metadata management.", Hanna Kleemola ,Data , 31.1.2020
The path to the realization of my dreams – Life as an SAP Solution Consultant,/en/blog/2020/01/the-path-to-the-realization-of-my-dreams--life-as-an-sap-solution-consultant/,Meet our people / Izabella  Kędzierska / 30.1.2020,"Due to my knowledge of German, I was offered many exciting tasks and foreign roles – even though I was only 20 years old! Unfortunately, we mostly communicated in writing, so I wasn’t able to improve my verbal skills much. Therefore, I came to the following conclusion: I have to develop from a key user into a consultant in order to work abroad.The completion of my SAP certification was my first step. The interview at Tieto took place the very next day.The beginning of my adventure at TietoWhen the job offer from Tieto Austria came, I wanted to jump for joy! I couldn't believe that my dream to work abroad as a consultant would come true. I have always appreciated the way of working in German-speaking countries, so I was excited to finally be part of this working environment.I joined Tieto in February 2016 as a Junior Consultant in the Finance Industry. The beginning was not easy because of the dialect of my (mostly male) colleagues. It was a time full of doubts, but this fortunately passed, thanks to my team. Already on the very first day, I got to work on a project and prove myself I can do it, which made the first working day very exciting.Thanks to the support of my experienced team colleagues, I was able to constantly develop myself further – and gradually assume responsibility for certain areas. During this time, I was involved in a variety of projects that made me more and more independent.Short break and returnAfter three years with Tieto, I decided to take on a new challenge and ended up in a bank as an in-house consultant. After a few months, the first doubts about my role arose: Do the tasks contribute to my development? Is there any potential here to continue learning and to broaden my consulting horizons? Did I learn a lot technically? The answers were 'NO'.I returned to Tieto because I appreciate the agile organisational structure and decision-making autonomy in my areas of responsibility. On the other hand, I don't know of any other consulting firm where people are so friendly and respectful of each other. We work so closely together as a team to make the projects successful and pay so much attention to the balance between work and personal life. The trust placed on the employees creates a very pleasant working atmosphere, and I am already looking forward to many exciting new projects in the new TietoEVRY.Check out our open SAP positions on our career site – and apply now!Read more about the TietoEVRY merge at www.tietoevry.com.", Izabella  Kędzierska ,Meet our people , 30.1.2020
Cybersecurity in your organization,/en/blog/2020/01/cyber-security-in-your-organization/,Cybersecurity insights / Diego López / 29.1.2020,"The thing is, even though organizations are using technology of today to do new and exciting digitalization stuff, the thinking of cybersecurity threats are in many cases and in many organizations up to a decade old. We live in a new world in terms of technology; but cyberthreats are viewed as they were back in the early 2010’s.We will get to Nils Bohlin and Samuel W. Alderson in a moment.What unfortunately follows is that as the view of threats is obsolete, in terms of both what kind of threats there are and their drivers, the obsolete way may also extend to the ways threats are mitigated and the protective measures employed. We fear cybercrime, but we fear the wrong things; hence we prepare for the wrong things.No big surprise: customers are targeted because of information and money. According to the latest Verizon Data Breach Report from 2019, 71% of breaches were financially motivated. 25% were to gain advantage (espionage).The modern approach to cybersecurity involves having multiple layers of protection, topped off by threat detection and mitigation. Looking at numbers from various sources, the layers of security help prevent 90-95% of attacks, which today are almost an ongoing thing. Detection is required especially for specifically targeted attacks, which are difficult to stop. One cannot afford to be blind in the cyberworld.Even though, as noted, cybercrime is the dark side of digitalization, we cannot allow ourselves to be numbed by it – we cannot allow it to become normal. As if you left your car unlocked, because it will be stolen anyway. The race between cyber criminals and defenders is a constant, and with the developing of technology, organizations need to keep up with technological advancements in cyber security.The automotive industry has safety structures and technology which has evolved throughout the ages, with advances made in both technology and attitudes. The first cars had no safety features whatsoever. Concerns on driver safety began to emerge in the late 1920s, and shatter proof windshields were among the first safety features introduced. This then gradually evolved to the three-point seatbelts, airbags, crumple zones, side impact safety systems, automotive radar systems and so on, of today.The point here is, one needs to keep up with the cybersecurity technology and other developments, and continuously upgrade the protection of one’s environment. If you stop at stuff done today, your setup will be obsolete tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow at the latest. You need to make sure you have the car with the latest safety. Otherwise you will end up being a crash test dummy, thrown about without protection, when an incident hits (and it will hit at some point).Being as prepared as you can for possible threats will help you a long way. At least you will be mentally prepared for handling events that occur outside of your everyday tasks. This helps when the unexpected happens and It´s like good old Murphy said: If it can happen, it will happen.We now get to Nils Bohlin and Samuel W. Alderson. Bohlin invented the three-point seatbelt. Alderson invented the crash test dummy. Both contributed markedly to automobile and driving safety. You do not need to become either of them. But you need to know enough and have what you need to be the master of your own cybersecurity fate.Do you want to know more about cybersecurity risks in your business, and how to counter them? I will be happy to discuss this with you further.", Diego López ,Cybersecurity insights , 29.1.2020
Predictive Marketing Basics,/en/blog/2020/01/predictive-marketing-basics-7-steps-to-good-data/,Data / Matti Airas / 28.1.2020,"Not sure what predictive marketing is? Learn more: Introduction to Predictive Marketing AnalyticsGraphic: Customer profile including predictive scores.Here is a checklist of the system capabilities and operational principles that can help you improve the quality of your data:Capture interaction data from all touchpoints. Predictive marketing data needs to reflect the actual customer journey. Collecting data is easier in the digital world, but you should also put in place mechanisms to capture IRL (in-real-life) events like store visits and encounters with potential customers at trade shows, events, CRM activities and so on.
Tie interactions to a cookie or email. Without an identity–an actual person–there is no one to directly communicate with. Visitor (cookie based) communication is limited to website and webstore personalization and ad targeting. Then, when they submit a webform, the cookie and all related interactions can be tied to a contact email. Keep in mind that this can get quite complicated when contacts use multiple devices, sometimes even multiple browsers, from many locations with different IP addresses. Identity stitching tools or functions solve this challenge.
Tie contacts to a company. If you cannot assign a contact to a company, their value for B2B business is very limited. Once a contact submits a webform with their company name, this task is easy. But you can and should match contacts to their company before knowing exactly who they are: find out their IP address and then use reverse-IP lookup to map them to a company. This is especially important in Account-Based Marketing (ABM) where some of the buying team members might never submit a webform.
Maintain and enrich master data. Keep your more static contact and company data in good shape (up-to-date, accurate, no duplicates, etc.) and enrich it with information that can be used in segmentation and lead prioritization. This includes contact data like job title and firmographics like industry classification and company size. You also need to enrich customer data with predictive attributes like leads score or churn propensity.
Capture critical conversion points. There are five touchpoints or moments in the customer journey that you absolutely need to capture: first touch, lead capturing, opportunity creation, deal closing, and retention. If you can pinpoint the customer, marketing, or sales action that preceded each of these conversion points, you have a good game plan for converting your next customer. Once customers enter your digital domain (Marketing Automation Platform and CRM = the last four touchpoints) this becomes easier, but you can only analyze the effectiveness of the first touchpoint by tagging all your marketing channels and campaigns (display ads, social media, referral web pages, third-party apps etc.).
Do not manually touch or manipulate your data. Data extraction and transformation must be done using scripts because manual handling may reduce its quality. Unless you are the data scientist responsible for ETL (and if you don’t know what this means, this is probably not you), do not aggregate data or transform the data in any way. Don’t manipulate data by hand (in Excel or anywhere else if you can possibly avoid it).
Enrich with sales and contract data. At minimum, you should have these three pieces of information for each customer: 1. total revenue during the past year, 2. the number of sales transactions (or the number of subscriptions) during that year, and 3. the date of their latest purchase. If you are in B2B business, you should also get basic contract data also. Installed base data with commissioning dates gives you the ability to pinpoint extended warranty and spare parts opportunities.While this might sound like a lot of work, your company is most likely already doing most of these things. You simply need to make contacts with the right people in your company in order to get access to this data and make sure the principles listed above are being followed.There is no better way to get to know your customers than Predictive Marketing. And those companies that know their customers the best will win the game in the long run.", Matti Airas ,Data , 28.1.2020
The five ways of developing or sourcing a machine learning model,/en/blog/2020/01/the-five-ways-of-developing-or-sourcing-a-machine-learning-model/,Data / Tietoevry at your service / 9.1.2020,"Here are the five different ways to develop or source a machine learning modelDevelop them yourself using open source code or third-party R, Python, or other libraries like Tensorflow. Developing these fully on your own may be an option, but make sure that you have machine learning experts working for your company. It is not enough to have programmers and statisticians, although they are also needed. Machine learning is its own unique field of science.
Buy an off-the-shelf model development tool, such as RapidMiner. Tools like this can be used by almost anyone. Using them doesn’t require programming skills or understanding of programming languages.
License a business process specific solution from a software company. For example, there are service providers for predictive marketing, such as 6Sense, Lattice Engines, and Sidetrade.
Buy machine learning functionality as a feature in your platform. For example, most Online Personalization Engines (OPE), Multichannel Campaign Management (MCCM), and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions provide a recommendation, lead scoring, or churn propensity analysis as part of their solution. Naturally, with an additional cost.
Buy the development and management of a machine learning model as a service from a consultancy and software development company. If you don’t have the knowledge, competence, and resources to develop and maintain the machine learning model, this might be your best option.The quality – the accuracy of predictions – might vary between these five options. How to then choose between the different options? A good rule of thumb is that if your data is from a more generic process, similar to what your competitors are running, then lower accuracy might be acceptable and you can source ML as a business process specific solution or part of the platform (options 3 and 4). But if your process and data are truly unique and ML ads a strategic component to your product or service portfolio, then you are better off developing the model yourself or source it as a custom project from a company that is specialized in advanced analytics and machine learning.", Tietoevry at your service ,Data , 9.1.2020
Customer experience trends in the banking industry in 2020,/en/blog/2020/01/customer-experience-trends-in-banking-industry/,Data / Tietoevry at your service / 8.1.2020,"Trend 1: Digitalization & AutomationLooking back on 2019, one central focus for companies has been to digitalize and automate as many processes as possible. With a cyclical change coming up, this will be a continuous focus also in 2020. Companies must find their way to become even more efficient and cost conscious and still keep a high level of customer loyalty.In Brilliant's latest study looking at different industries, the banking industry (including both major banks and niche banks) shows to be somewhere in the middle when it comes to how loyal their customers are. About 54% of customers are loyal to the banks compared to top scoring insurance with 64% loyal customers and lowest in telecom 46%.Trend 2: The Whole Customer Journey is What Matters to Build LoyaltyBrilliant's data over the past five years shows a positive trend in how front-line employees respond to their customers. Once customers are in contact with the bank, they give service a relatively high rating, no matter how critical they are to the bank in general.Even if we see employee engagement as important for excellent service, it is not the only factor impacting customer loyalty in banking. How easy it is to solve an issue is also a strong part of customers’ experience. This can sometimes be an issue that has nothing to do with customer service. And customer loyalty does not come from a single part of the customer’s journey. Banks and other companies should continue to measure customer experience parallel to implementing cross functional activities, making sure customers have friction free and easy interactions with all functions of the company.Trend 3: More Data Analysis to Lead to Better CXThe data that is collected today - both indirect and direct data - usually provides a large amount of open text data and audio files. For those more mature and data intensive companies, it is no longer manageable to read and listen to all. Therefore, we expect to see much more voice to text and open text analysis the coming year. For banking (that also have to take compliance into the equation) this means that customer feedback can be used in a much better and efficient way and can involve other parts of the organisation and drive cross functional collaboration.In 2020, we will see more programs/systems that can handle all customer interactions and provide a better overview of the whole customer journey with both indirect and direct data. Systems that can engage the entire organization and trigger activities that lead to improved customer experience in all parts of the journey.Trend 4: Brand Experience Also Including Interactions with SuppliersInvoice solution companies, customer service, debt collection companies among others will impact the experience and image of your brand. The customer does not always see the underlying players when in contact with your company, nor do they care. The risk of being adversely affected by someone else's demerit is higher and can, in the worst case, also cost more for your company. If you choose to outsource functions, you want them to have the same level of commitment meeting your customers as yourself. We will probably see more collaborations with external influencers to formulate common customer experience goals and cooperate more when it comes to how to deliver the best experience.

Later during my university studies majoring in marketing in the Oulu Business School at the University of Oulu I was experimenting with various blog platforms, web-analytics tools and social media platforms to see what they can do. After graduating, it was evident that I would pursue a career in digital marketing. After a few years of doing sales & marketing-related jobs I landed my first job in digital marketing with a title Growth Hacker that gave me an opportunity to specialize in marketing automation and in optimizing digital customer journeys.It was clear that at some point I wanted to move from standalone marketing automation emails towards customer cases that involved the complete digital ecosystem. That’s when Tieto CEM contacted me and we started the talks on the next step on my career path. During the conversations with the likes of Head of Marketing Science & Salesforce, the team members from the Marketing Science & Salesforce and Head of CEM, it became evident that I wanted to be part of the team of dreams of CEM. The possibility to work in an organization that had under the same umbrella the complete digital customer experience suite sounded so fascinating that I definitely wanted to be part of it.After joining Tieto in 2019, the time at CEM has given me a lot. In an organisation with no hierarchy, I have been thrown into situations where I would have not imagined to be 5 years ago. I have been given great responsibilities, I have been trusted with big cases and I have received thank you when it has been time to thank. People respect themselves within CEM and that makes the organization so unique. When you spend 37.5 hours a week at the office you need to feel welcome and that’s the feeling that I get when I open the Tieto HQ door at Keilaniemi on a Monday morning and the feeling has not changed when I close the door on Friday evening. The reason why I would encourage others to join Tieto CEM is the fact being that we appreciate people who you work with and everybody has also a good work-life balance. I personally balance my work with a weekly dose of various endurance sports.Fun fact about me: I am a 2-time Ironpig World Champion (Terässika) that is a multisport event consisting of a super sprint triathlon and a litre of beer.Explore life at Tieto CEMFind out what it's like to work at Tieto's Customer Experience Management business unit and join our team!", Tietoevry at your service ,Meet our people , 3.1.2020
Holographic future through the HoloLens 2,/en/blog/2019/10/holographic-future-through-the-hololens-2/,Digitalization / Ksenia Avetisova / 25.10.2019,"Making its way to our private time, mixed reality is higher demand in business world. Microsoft has showcased the next generation of their mixed reality headset, Hololens 2, which has what it takes to drive the new opportunities and use cases across industries.About three years ago, the presentation of the mixed-reality HoloLens glasses from Microsoft aroused great interest among professional users in industry and commerce. Since then, HoloLens has become the first choice for mixed reality solutions in the industrial environment. Tieto has worked on multiple projects bringing the real-time data visualization, remote guidance and mixed reality training via Hololens.We have learnt that apart from the wow effect, the device offers convenience to the users when they need to collaborate, or access senor data, instructions and manuals in context of the factory environment. Over the years, however, we have identified several improvement areas and that’s exactly why we are so excited.The HoloLens 2 is significantly more compact and lighter than its predecessor and has a field of view twice as large. Another major step, made possible by new sensors such as the Azure Kinect DK, is the ability of the glasses to capture and visualize their surroundings in three dimensions. The newly designed tracking of the pupils and both hands allows a significantly improved, intuitive handling of the mixed reality glasses in use. Also, very promising is the Microsoft HoloLens Customization Program, which allows users to customize for various purposes. The program now also enables the development of HoloLens 2 eyewear integrated into safety helmets, for example, which can easily withstand the strict safety regulations in the industry.My colleague at Tieto Enhanced Reality CoE Helmut Krämer, XR Evangelist and one of the most profound experts on Microsoft's development environments in Austria, sees great potential in the new mixed reality glasses for use in the manufacturing and processing industry as well as in many other fields: “Mixed Reality will continue to assert itself in industry and in the industrial sector. The release of OPENXR, which enables us to develop apps for HoloLens 2 and all other relevant devices, will give the technology a further boost.”Even though the sales date of Hololens 2 is still not confirmed, we had an opportunity to get to know the device last month in Microsoft Austria at an exclusive hands-on session arranged for Tieto customers. What we’ve seen is worth the wait. The hand-tracking and interaction have been drastically improved, and the wider field of view is a definite enabler of the smoother experience. We are already working actively with our customers to translate their needs into solutions supported by the next generation holographic devices.

Organization as living organism and complex adaptive system,/en/blog/2019/10/organization-as-living-organism-and-complex-adaptive-system/,Digitalization /  Fredrik  Jansson / 23.10.2019,"Our blog series (Opening blog) started by describing the big difference of “Organizations as machines” vs. “Organizations as living organisms”. This difference is essential when aiming to unleash the power of purpose for organizations (Blog No 9) and individuals (Blog No 10).Systems theory and systems thinking are at the heart of this approach. In organizational context that would mean that we look at organization as a system, as a whole, understanding that the value is built into the relations between different parts of the organization and to optimize it we need to have a holistic view rather than optimizing just small pieces at time.School of fish forming a adaptive network and living organismSystems Theory history overviewGeneral Systems Theory was already founded in 1960s and has since then been researched and used in different branches of science (biology, finance, human interaction etc.). In organizational context studies often use the metaphor of “living biological organism”. These studies and the pioneering work of Daniel Katz and Robert Kahn year 1966 offered an alternative perspective to classical management. That time, management models and taylorism considered organizations as machines. Systems Theory instead started to consider organizations as living organisms and later, complex adaptive system theory was born.Organizations as Complex Adaptive System in a nutshellIn Complex Adaptive System theory, organization is considered as a constantly changing living organism where different parts (of very different size and type) are interrelated and change is emergent. The reason for such approach for organizations comes from the change of the environment we live in. We can all see how world is moving towards VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) which requires highest adaptation capabilities that the traditional organizations don’t provide. System should always be viewed as a whole, not as a collection of pieces. Changes to one part has always influence on the other parts. The idea is that the system is much greater than the sum of its parts.System is constantly changing. This happens in a self-organized manner where local micro level interaction of the parts makes the system to automatically adapt to changing situation and environment.Short feedback loops are important in systems adaptation and evolution. Negative feedback will re-establish the steady course back, whereas positive feedback will amplify the things that provided it.Systems thinking and systemic value creation in our own contextSystems thinking is the key element of one of our four core beliefs. Our Core Belief #1 is called “Systems over Blueprints”. Core beliefs, for us, are four strong statements that define what we deeply believe in. All the decisions we make are based on our Core Beliefs. They are helping anyone in the organization to choose the right way.Our Core Belief #1: systems thinking and systemic value creationSystems over blueprints for us means that we don’t believe in organizing our operations with pre-defined processes, operational blueprints and fixed role descriptions. Instead we consider our organization as a system, where teams and individuals are constantly learning and adapting their operations based on the changing environment and situation. There is no “one best way to do things”. Instead, the teams are all the time trying to learn and iteratively find the fit-for-purpose way to do things. Co-operation in the network with extreme transparency and sharing of learnings is essential for the system to develop and scale on macro level.The idea of systemic value creation is at the heart of our operations. It means that all the parts of the system, individuals and teams, are constantly seeking for the optimal ways for creating value for the system and hence, value for the purpose the system is built for. Instead of giving commands, the leaders in the system are trying to see the whole system and enable maximal value creation for the different parts.As we can see in the picture, we consider our clients to be part of the same system, where we together with the clients aim at creating maximal value to the end customers, the customers of our clients.Referring back to the ideas in the previous blog (Blog No 10) the leaders shall not only focus on enabling the maximal value creations for the parts. In addition to that they need to be sensing the mode of teams and individuals and aim to find the sweet-spot where both the team’s and individual’s inspiration meets the systemic value creation. When finding that sweet-spot, great things start to happen and system really start to live.Moving System Thinking from slides to realityIn our 600+ people organization we have iteratively developed a set of boarding modules that we use for helping the teams to develop their operations towards our future target state of living organism.One of our boarding modules is focusing on systemic value creation. While the previous modules are focusing on team’s own identity, mission, vision and understanding of the business they generate, this module is all about how the team is part of the whole system, how they generate value for the system and how do they get value from the system. When driving for teams with high autonomy we always have a risk of building smaller silos (teams) that would only care about their own things if we were not widening the team’s perspective to system level thinking and mindset.In the boarding module with our teams we discuss about the key drivers of behavior in a traditional machine alike organizations vs. living organism. Often, in traditional organizations the key behavioral driver is to delight one’s manager which has multiple negative and limiting consequences. In living organism, it should be about where can one create highest value for the system and where that meets person’s own inspiration the best. In the boarding sessions we also look at the system we have and start identifying how the team is related to the system and where are the most important interrelations to other teams and value streams between them. This exercise might sometimes feel too obvious or too simple first, but the key is to change the viewpoint and mindset. It is fantastic to see how teams start to see their value based on who they work with and what the whole system tries to achieve rather than just their own part. It makes their part much more meaningful and builds the purpose stronger as well.Systemic value creation in recruitment discussionsSystems over blueprints Core Belief and the idea of systemic value creation has an important role in all our new recruitment discussions. We explain this idea in detail to our potential new colleagues and instead of discussing about fixed roles and job description, we are having a dialogue with the candidate for together identifying the possibilities where the candidate’s inspiration and value to our system would match. As the system is continuously changing also the value creation and roles of the people are changing. In the discussions with new candidates we try to find an area where the person has a good chance to start the work but there is even more focus on looking the future and potential areas for value creation in longer term. All this leads to our value proposition being that everyone should have maximal freedom to seek for the place and role in the organization where the one’s value and inspiration are at highest leading to maximal engagement and hence, maximal value created.How does it feel in real life for managers / leadersLeading an organization as a machine or as a living organism are two totally different things. We have experienced both worlds. Enabling value creation for others vs. giving commands to others make your interaction with people totally different. The change doesn’t happen overnight, for us it has required long process of reflections, thinking, testing, failing and great moments of success that bring you confidence. One specific requirement to the leaders is that they shall not focus on their territory, instead they shall be good at understanding how the whole systems works with a good eye on sensing the mode of different parts in the system.We have also organized all our sales operations with the same ideas. Letting the traditional ideas of Predict & Control and Carrot & Stick go and starting to organize sales as a living organism with Mastery-Autonomy-Purpose. That has really been an exciting journey.With passion and humility,Jaakko Hartikainen & Mikko VirtanenOur blog series:No 1: Call for Paradigm Shift in ManagementNo 2: Magnitude of Change when Shifting Management ParadigmNo 3: Why do so many companies manage people like machines and why is it one of the biggest problems of our times?No 4: How to drive paradigm level change?  Our learnings and one crucial breakthrough innovationNo 5: Incredible India and breaking the hierarchyNo 6: Management paradigms in a nutshell, inspired by Frederic Laloux's book Reinventing OrganizationsNo 7: Our unforgettable journey to trust, transparency and eventually success No 8: We all know that “Carrot and Stick” model is outdated — Why is it so damn hard to implement new ways?No 9: The Power of PurposeNo 10: Finding your purpose and living your life with it can unleash tremendous potential No 11: Organization as living organism and complex adaptive system",  Fredrik  Jansson ,Digitalization , 23.10.2019
Innovations for the climate,/en/blog/2019/10/innovations-for-the-climate/,Sustainability / Kia Haring / 15.10.2019,"The pressure to solve climate change is above all on companies: almost one half of the Finns who answered an enquiry by Climate Circle felt that companies are doing too little to combat climate change.Tieto’s major carbon dioxide emissions result from business travelling, premises and data centres. We already use green electricity at our data centres, and our head office in Keilalahti, Espoo, with its responsible solutions has earned the highest-level Platinum LEED certification for its environmentally friendly operations.After the changes that we have already made, our primary goal is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions arising from travelling by using new meeting technologies and choosing means of travelling that do not use fossil fuels.In the first half of 2019, we managed to cut down the CO2 emissions of business travelling by 1 500 tons compared with the corresponding period 2018.As it is not possible to stop travelling altogether, we also actively look for new ways of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.From little brooksIn the spring of 2019, we participated in auctions arranged by Puro (in English brook), trading on CO2 removal certificates. Puro is a pilot project by 23 forerunner companies in Finland aiming at turning carbon dioxide removal into verifiable and comparable commercial operations. Tieto uses the certificates on CO2 removal that it has purchased for neutralising its carbon dioxide emissions in Finland. Tieto aims at reducing its business travel CO2 emission to below 800 kg per employee annually.This goal is of great importance, as Tieto's operations are global and its clients are located in different parts of the world. It is not enough to just restrict business travelling. If we wish to reduce our impacts on the climate, we also need other actions, such as removing an amount of carbon dioxide that corresponds to our emissions.Future society and markets require initiatives where several actors work jointly for the climate.Market mechanisms, such as Puro, offer actors in different sectors the opportunity to remove carbon dioxide from circulation on a longer term.According to recent studies, ecosystem operations can create major opportunities for new businesses. Read what Antti Vihavainen, the father of Puro.earth concept, has to say about removing CO2 from the atmosphere.“Acting through Puro has a direct impact on removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as well as on expanding the markets of climate-friendly products and developing materials that absorb carbon dioxide.Puro’s goals are ambitious. When the emission reductions obtained through the EU Emissions Trading System are about 130 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, Puro plans to achieve the same size range by 2030 by stimulating business operations that remove carbon dioxide from circulation on a long term.Puro creates new connections between companies and material suppliers in order to promote the creation and development of new ecosystems. And when companies work together, it is possible to drive a major change in the market as well as to create and support new, more sustainable business operations that combat the climate change. The advantages of ecosystem operations arise in the market shift and though the new business operations resulting from it.”The primary goal of companies and other organisations is to reduce the environmental impacts of their operations. In addition, we must actively look for new means of compensating our impacts. Through open-minded co-operation like Puro we can achieve major impacts of a new type that the climate will benefit from at a rapid pace.Want to hear more? Subscribe to our newsletter here.", Kia Haring ,Sustainability , 15.10.2019
Will business optimization in 5G kill cross-industry collaboration?,/en/blog/2019/10/will-business-optimization-in-5g-kill-cross-industry-collaboration/,Data / Mikel Echegoyen / 10.10.2019,"5G is expected to open huge opportunities for digital services, enabling new types of services based on billions of connected cars and devices. There’s just one hitch: telecom and automotive industries must find a common tune.Collaboration challenges to overcomeBuilding 5G infrastructure is costly for operators, but mobile subscribers won’t pay enough of that bill. Operators hope that 5G-based industry solutions, e.g. automotive, will generate them a great deal of new business, justifying investments. They see automotive manufacturers and brands as key customers consuming 5G services for connected and autonomous cars.But some automotive players don’t seem to trust that telecom service providers can answer their needs. Consequently, they want to build their own local 5G infrastructure for their manufacturing plants. They are also wary that telecom network providers may not be ready for 5G deployments fast enough. Car manufacturers wish to handle the security and reliability of the network without relying on third parties. They are also reluctant to expose strategically important digitalization activities and valuable data.Moreover, uncertainty rises in Europe as safety standards are being legislated related to Vehicle-to-Everything, or V2X, as it’s commonly called. Two clear camps have formed, and they both have strong backing:Mature, but long-term limited DSRC (Wi-Fi-based) supported by automotive and traffic industries  
Up and coming C-V2X (Cellular, 4G based today and 5G based in the future) providing more future-proof support and functionality, promoted by the telecom industry and some leading car brandsThe debate is ongoing – but having full interoperability between both technologies is an expensive and complex solution, which doesn’t bring any additional value.Calling for industry collaboration – highways would be a great place to startTelecom operators are focusing first on 5G rollouts to large cities, but from an autonomous driving perspective, highways would be an easier problem to solve.    While Automotive OEMs could run their own 5G networks in-factory, building and running a widely available 5G network for their fleets is not feasible, as they lack the economies of scale.    To meet automotive safety standards, 5G infrastructure for highways must have co-investments from several parties in order to make a reasonable business case.   Timelines are critical because automotive OEMs need to plan and integrate technologies in vehicles 3-4 years ahead to account for their lead-time. Yet operators are not ready to provide rollout, coverage, pricing and business models for 5G just now.     While there are cross-industry alliances such as 5GAA (in the C-V2X camp) and Car2Car (in the DSRC camp), there is just too much agenda to push and lots of future business at stake.   At present, we still lack serious discussion about the broader ecosystem. I hope to see much more concrete co-operation cases and promising pilots. Tieto serves both the telecom and automotive industry, and we are keen to facilitate this development.Read also: How will 5G and network slicing revolutionize business?", Mikel Echegoyen ,Data , 10.10.2019
What is the deal with data protection – are you following these strategies?,/en/blog/2019/09/what-is-the-deal-with-data-protection--are-you-following-these-strategies/,Cybersecurity insights / Sean Armana / 25.9.2019,"Data protection is the process of safeguarding important information from corruption, compromise or loss. As the amount of data created and stored continues to grow at unprecedented rates, the importance of data protection increases. Furthermore, there is little tolerance for downtime when accessing important information.A large part of a data protection strategy is ensuring that data can be restored quickly after any corruption or loss. Protecting data from compromise and ensuring data privacy are other key components of data protection.Data classification is as fundamental a part of securing data as knowing what data you have and who can access it. It is the process of identifying and assigning pre-determined levels of sensitivity to different types of data.A proper data classification regime allows data owners to apply or require appropriate controls based on a predetermined category data. This is especially important from a financial part of business, since different security controls often comes with a different cost. It is rare to have the same kinds of controls for all kinds of data. If the data owner doesn’t properly classify the dataset, then one cannot properly protect the data.For data to be protected throughout the entire value chain requires that security mechanisms ensure that data is protected when data is stored, when data is in transit, and when data is set for destruction. Holistic safeguard of data and the availability of data in all circumstances is the key principle of data protection. Thus, as in general information security, the best security is the one that comes in several layers and levels, so-called Defense In Depth.Data protection strategies are evolving along two lines:Data availability:Data owners and data users expect full availability of data from any geographical location at any time in order to conduct business even if the data is damaged or lost.Data management:Data management covers two key areas in terms of data protection. The two areas are:Data lifecycle management:This is mainly the process of automating the transportation of data to online and offline storage, regardless of its data classification.Information lifecycle management.This is mainly a comprehensive strategy for valuing, cataloging and protecting data from application and user errors, malware and virus attacks, machine failure or facility outages and disruptions.In business one is used to the mindset of safe working practices. This same mindset should apply for your data, and by enforcing security when it comes to handling data, sensitive or other, whether the data is at rest or transit. Data is the backbone that makes up many customer-focused businesses, and protecting it should never be an afterthought.Are you looking for a company that can provide data protection for your business?

Public sector – what to do with the cloud? Ideas and tips,/en/blog/2019/09/what-to-do-with-the-cloud/,Cybersecurity insights / Peter Österdahl / 17.9.2019,"During the summer, I have been reflecting on the first half of the year, and what insights it could give for the second half. Some of the expectations and requirements from our customers will most likely be within secure cloud transformation services and/or migrations. But I also believe the need for Cloud Security Assessment or Cloud Security Reviews will be needed for a lot of the business who were early adopters.  The current speed of cloud migration and adoption is immense.Businesses are one thing; but how does the public sector stand in relation to the cloud? As discussed in my previous post,  there seems to be some hesitance for using the cloud in the public sector.It is gratifying to see that things are happening on this front. In Finland, The Ministry of Finance has drafted a decision on policies which ”...specify how data owned by a public sector organisation can be processed in cloud services.” (…) ”The aim of the policies is to support decision-making in the central government, counties and municipalities as they plan and procure new ICT services.”In Sweden, the situation is somewhat different. As reported in February, based on a six-month review by Sweden’s National Purchasing Center, “The Swedish government has said it will not set up a cloud framework for the procurement of public sector contracts, claiming it would receive “zero tenders”. (…) “It found that suppliers in the Swedish market would not be able to meet its technical or legal requirements.”In a way, the hesitance of the public sector – reflected as differing policies in even neighbouring countries - is completely natural. Considering that for example only recently there was news from overseas that the FBI has arrested a person in what seems to be quite a breach of customer data from the bank Capital One. The data of 100 million customers compromised from data stored in the cloud. 100 million customers equal the population of Germany and Sweden combined.While any breach is, of course, disturbing and painful for the parties involved, the public sector (as it should) is even warier of citizen data or other society sensitive data falling into the wrong hands.However, the cloud is here, and much needed. No one organization can possess the resources to maintain AND develop an ICT environment which encompasses all that it is required to do in this day and age.What, then, is the best way forward?There are some things which come naturally as first steps when considering the cloud. Below these tips listed:Asset management. Start by reviewing your assets. If you are not aware of what you have, how can you protect yourself?  
Security assessment. Treat the cloud as any other on-premise environment. Things are moving fast, so also get a second opinion in order to be risk-aware. 
Get rid of the blind spots.  Ensure the relevant policies are in place, and follow up and make sure they are followed. 
Ensure visibility. Make sure that your Security Operations have the same kind of visibility of the cloud as they do elsewhere in your systems.Tieto Security Services can help you with the necessary controls and mechanisms to make your cloud transformation journey secure!  Already out there?

Born in Morocco, Houda studied computer science and technology before she completed a degree in Business informatics in France. This led her to the University of Oslo, and she is now curious about what working in innovation in combination with entrepreneurship involves.
We are a big organisation and have a lot of exciting partners. It is important that all our ideas and initiatives are brought together so that we can be more focused and effective in our innovation work. The project’s aim is to make it easier for employees to put forward their ideas and be part of their development and to shorten the path from idea to action.
Combining theory and practice
- We have learnt a lot of theory about technology, innovation and entrepreneurship. It will be exciting to learn more about how they work in practice, comments Bikash Thapa, who was born in Nepal. Before studying at the University of Oslo, Bikash completed a master’s degree in hydropower development at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
Julian Heimonen Hjallum from Porsgrunn is the third student who will be part of the project. Alongside studying, he has gained experience from three start-ups. He is now looking forward to working in innovation at a larger organisation.
The students will work in close collaboration with a broad team of employees from TietoEVRY. They will become an integral part of our organisation. They will have their own email address, access card and access to Workplace by Facebook, which is our intranet and where we go for knowledge and to network with employees in other departments. These students will be located in Fornebu and will sit together with other interns working on different innovation projects.
We feel certain that these students will be able to challenge our established ways of working thanks to their backgrounds and expertise.
Strategic initiative
The collaboration between the University of Oslo and TietoEVRY is part of a new programme that also involves Telenor, Schibsted and DNV GL. The programme consists of these four companies inviting students to undertake innovation projects as part of their masters’ programmes at the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo.
- This collaboration will give us access to projects that are both very high quality and cutting-edge, and our students will get the chance to gain inside experience of the innovation cultures of major organisations that represent attractive potential employers, comments Jens Petter Falck, Associate Professor and the course convenor for one of the masters’ programs.
He explains that the aim of the innovation projects is to provide students with in-depth understanding and practical experience of carrying out innovation projects at large, complex organisations
- There is a lot of interest in and an increasing need for experience of the workplace in higher education. We are therefore very pleased about this newly created collaboration that will see masters’ students gain guided workplace experience at high-quality specialist companies, comments Morten Dæhlen, the Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences.
- It is a win-win as it will both provide our students with relevant work experience and give the companies a well-qualified workforce that will solve genuine innovation challenges, he adds.
TietoEVRY’s senior management team is very enthusiastic about the initiative, which is an important part of the company’s work to accelerate its innovation work.
- The students have approaches to technology and problem-solving and insight that we think can help us to see things from a new perspective. This unique collaboration will strengthen our rate of innovation. Innovation and entrepreneurship are strategically important to us as part of our work to create digital services that create significant value for our customers. We regard the Department of Informatics as an attractive source of both knowledge and highly sought-after candidates, comments Trond Vinje, Executive Vice President for HR at TietoEVRY.", Trond Vinje ,Meet our people , 4.9.2019
My Summer Internship at Tietoevry: Diving head-first and learning to swim,/en/blog/2019/08/my-summer-internship-at-tieto-diving-head-first-and-learning-to-swim/,Meet our people / Recruitment  Team / 26.8.2019,"Diving head-first…To be honest, a year ago when I first started here, I had no clue as to what I would be doing for the next four months. I applied for the summer trainee position of “Junior BI (Business Intelligence) Specialist” and had only a basic knowledge of what BI meant. No wonder I was terrified when starting on the first day of May. Luckily, another trainee started on the same day, and somehow, we managed to survive the summer (actually, we managed really well, to brag a bit). In fact, I was offered a part-time contract after my first summer, even though I still had three years of school to go.… and learning to swimNow, if we time travel to this moment, it is my second summer here at Tietoevry, and I just signed another part-time contract for the next year. In one year, I have learned the basics of SQL programming, ETL loads, different data tools, DevOps, agile teamwork – you name it! Most of these things have been completely new to me.My major is economics, but during the past year I’ve focused more on information technology and database systems. Working at Tieto has made it clear to me that I’ve always liked working with numbers and that I am a bit nerdy about computers. Mixing these two makes perfect sense, as nowadays you cannot separate technological solutions from economics. The way we process data is the beating heart of business intelligence.Starting off my career while studying has not been smooth sailing all the time. My experience reminded me of a Finnish saying that goes something like this:No matter how deep the water is, if you haven’t drowned, you’ve learned to swim.I am glad I ended up in a completely different field than I originally planned – and have learned to swim along the way.Friendships at workAt Tietoevry there’s a really active group of young professionals who organize all sorts of events from skiing trips to summer BBQ evenings. Through this network, I have met a lot of new people I hang out with during lunch and breaks. I also realized that Tietoevry is truly multilingual and multicultural as so many of my colleagues are originally from somewhere else than Finland. I myself come from a tiny city in eastern Finland, so even Helsinki felt like a foreign country in the beginning. But with such a great community and a mix of different people supporting you, I soon got over whatever culture shock I may have had.I’ve worked from our head office at Keilalahti but also remotely from my family’s summer cottage and my parent’s house. Sometimes the change of scenery and office has felt like a mini-break. You also get to enjoy longer weekend trips and spend more time with family and friends. And to my surprise, I’ve noticed that I’m more productive working from home. I think we can all agree that at the office the temptation to talk to friends and get distracted is always there.So what do I do at Tietoevry?My best answer is that at Tietoevry, I learn something new every day while working side by side with experienced colleagues in demanding customer projects.This may sound like a paid commercial (trust me, it isn’t), but I’ve really liked my time at Tietoevry. The trust and support I’ve received from my co-workers has helped me develop professionally, and I’ve been included in challenging projects and given responsibilities that match my current skill level. What I have worked on has never been too easy or too difficult. My job is to provide new insights and question old habits. To me, it sounds like a win-win situation.- - -Check out Summer Trainee positions 2021!", Recruitment  Team ,Meet our people , 26.8.2019
What real estate owners and managers need to know about combining business benefit and sustainability,/en/blog/2019/08/what-real-estate-owners-and-managers-need-to-know-about-combining-business-benefit-and-sustainability/,Sustainability / Tietoevry at your service / 23.8.2019,"In the Nordic countries, real estate property – residential, commercial and industrial buildings – accounts for 30–40% of the countries’ total consumption.When approximately 70 per cent of global energy production is consumed in cities, no wonder cities want to be at the forefront of sustainable development and have ambitious sustainability roadmaps. Owing to their northern location where a significant portion of the energy is used for heating, the Nordic cities are particularly interested in solutions that lead to more efficient energy solutions while enabling more renewable energy sources. Real estate, however, still have a long way to go towards carbon neutrality.Two major challengesBecause buildings in cities usually have been constructed within a wide timeframe, their structures, energy efficiency, technology and automation vary wildly. In such a heterogeneous environment, it is difficult to create energy solutions that scale to the entire property base.The second challenge involves property owners and managers. They have a hard time buying solutions because they do not know what the optimal solutions are that they should buy and what is available in the first place.The right way to the right solutionsThe buyers need enough information to be able to prepare RFPs that interest several providers and bring about genuine competition. For this, they should turn to experts who can look at the problem holistically, from power generation through distribution to onsite micro-production, demand response and even the buildings’ indoor comfort. An important part of the process is knowing how to evaluate the investment.The solution provider ecosystem needs to look at the issue end-to-end. Real benefits are not created by part-optimisation, such as optimising one building or a city block. Everything from controlling production to controlling building technology in real-time must be considered. Efficiency, cost-benefit and sustainability will come from a big-enough networked property base.New technology will enable this. Huge amounts of data can be collected throughout the generation-to-consumption chain. When it is analysed and augmented with data from external sources, such as weather forecasts, predictive control patterns emerge. The distributed energy system can then anticipate coming situations and manage the entire chain in a way that brings optimal benefit.Holistic energy managementEspecially in harsh climate conditions where heating is important, managing the end-to-end energy chain is important. Even more so when it is predicted that city heating in the Nordics, now generated 90% by district heating, will “electrify” due to improving heat pump and heat recovery technologies.Efficient, sustainable energy management will require a holistic management layer on top of building automation and other sub-systems, considering the varied individual building properties. This is totally doable through advanced digital solutions. The good news is that they already exist.The time to act was yesterdayCountries and cities have their climate goals. Solutions already exist, but most focus on part-optimisation. With 10 to 15 years to make the ambitions a reality, there is no time to waste.Integrating all the part-optimisation solutions requires a knowledgeable partner who knows how to bring together production, distribution, “behind-the-meter” micro-production, consumption management, demand response, all the way to indoor conditions.Make decisions now.

We take pride in diversity and equality,/en/blog/2019/06/tieto-takes-pride-in-diversity-and-equality/,Meet our people / Tietoevry at your service / 25.6.2019,"Pride Month has now evolved into a global movement of awareness and positive attitude – an inspiration to fight discrimination and prejudice in the world. Companies are also realizing that joining the Pride movement should be more than a bandwagon you jump on and off, or a colorful sticker you remove at the end of June. Promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace should be a year-round event.When you look beyond person’s race, gender, religion or political opinion, you give people an opportunity to grow and flourish in the workplace. You create an environment, where people don’t need to waste energy and creativity on hiding who they are or feeling ashamed. Being true to yourself enables you to be fully engaged to drive the goals of the entire company. The more diverse and inclusive a workplace is, the better the organization can also lure top talent to gain the competitive edge. And as the studies show, there is a definite link between diversity and a company’s financial performance.#1 in gender equalityTieto is operating in an industry, which has been male dominant for years, and it is still a fact that women are harder to attract to work in IT. Hence, during the past years, a lot of effort has been put in Tieto to lift the importance of an equal working culture. We are also proud to say that we were recently ranked the best technology company in the world for gender equality by Equileap.But the work doesn’t stop here. Within Tieto, we have jointly set a cultural ambition describing which behaviors we want to leave behind and what behaviors we want to see going forward. If we want true diversity, equality and inclusion at our workplaces, we need to walk the walk, not just talk about it. I personally promise to work actively on removing any barriers of change in Tieto and help people to unleash their full potential.Step by step, we are on a right track in building a better work place for everyone.- - -Tieto is collaborating with Pride Helsinki as a Theme partner of the event, read more about the collaboration here.Want to follow our journey?

DevOps in SAP - Did you know that it is now a certified capability?,/en/blog/2019/06/devops-in-sap---did-you-know-that-it-is-now-a-certified-capability/,Cloud / Tiia Kokko / 19.6.2019,"In front of the famous rolling stone in SAP headquarters, Walldorf (from left): Amit Chaturvedi, Martin Dedeke (auditor), Auli Peltola, Wolfgang Weinmann (auditor) and Rahul Kumar.The purpose of the certification program was to audit Tieto's capabilities to design, implement and run DevOps way of working in SAP. I want to express my special thanks to UPM allowing us to run the certification on their SAP cloud platform, which Tieto is developing and managing.Why is DevOps in SAP topical now?The DevOps way of working has been used in companies for quite a long time, with tangible results. Consequently, many companies are now trying to extend the approach to ERP Systems.Digital transformation, S/4HANA, multi-cloud adoptions, digital disruption, technology upgrade, and support patches among others collectively put positive pressure on businesses to innovate and deliver business needs & values faster with improved affordability.Conventional SAP development cycle has focused on keeping production stable but it is relatively slow and today's business demands agility. There is also a high risk of outages and downtimes associated with development projects. To address the ever-increasing necessity of continuous delivery adoption in the SAP ecosystem – DevOps for SAP is the answer and an accepted evolution of current SAP ALM.What does SAP-certified in DevOps mean in practice?I believe DevOps adoption in SAP ecosystems has several advantages.Faster time-to-value for development changes leading to enhanced business value
The ability to deliver SAP releases more frequently to the businesses to help cope up with varying market demands
Automated testing and quality checks reduce the number of fixes, justifies QA process, decreases expensive rework, and increase user satisfaction.
Savings in SAP change management budget can lead to more investments in SAP innovation plans
Fewer production issues considerably reduce risk, costs & sudden downtimes.
DevOps for SAP helps bring together both innovation and stabilitySAP ALM and development using Agile and DevOps methodsTieto is now an SAP DevOps certified partner with proven capabilities to automate the entire SAP cloud  development process. We can help companies reach their targets with SAP DevOps way of working, pipeline and toolchain. In practice, going for DevOps means actions like:Management commitment to drive change towards DevOps way of working via training investments, tooling, and automation.
Educating teams with demos and workshops on DevOps benefits, culture, methodologies and principles
Development strategy alignments with DevOps methods
Selection of Agile and DevOps tools
Technical assistance to ArchitectsThe final target is that DevOps implementation supports each team member in handling every part of development: frontend or backend along with operations including all tools or technologies.DevOps has come to the SAP world to stay. At the Sapphire 2019 event, Hasso Plattner, a co-founder of the SAP company, stated that all SAP development will focus on Cloud First solutions with rapid development cycles. This means that customers' capabilities to have daily releases instead of traditional monthly or quarterly releases will increase fast.Now is a good time to explore and onboard the DevOps way of working also in SAP.Over the past five years, Tieto has embarked on a journey to certify as many of our SAP-based portfolio services as possible.

"AI, Machine learning and the cloud: A giant opportunity for healthcare, but problems in adoption – why?",/en/blog/2019/06/opportunity-for-healthcare/,Cybersecurity insights / Peter Österdahl / 19.6.2019,"It could help e.g. in Predicting who might be developing cancer five years from now; in Preventing human errors in diagnostics; in Detecting a certain disease faster within x-ray images; and in assisting in the treatment or medication of already sick patients; and even helping out with the Response – advanced brain surgery.Wouldn’t that be something to aim for?For advancing AI and its usage, the adoption of the cloud is critical. AI requires massive computing power, and using the cloud is the only viable option to reap the full benefits of AI.However, in the Nordics, unlike the rest of the world, there seems to be a bit of resistance to AI. This is, on the one hand, consumer-related, as shown in a Tieto survey regarding AI. For the public sector, however, there is also the legislation perspective regarding the use of public cloud services. So, it would seem that there is this double whammy for adopting AI and the cloud in the public sector.What is the problem? Nowadays, the security and data protection capabilities of the cloud are at least equal to, if not even better than, those of traditional on-premises systems.And what’s really the deal with AI and Machine learning? According to just one estimate, the global investment in AI and Machine learning is massive and is expected to reach $6.6 billion in 2021. All the major public cloud providers, such as AWS, Google, IBM and Microsoft, invest heavily in this area and so do their business partners who utilize their cloud ecosystems, partners like Tieto.In Cybersecurity, we usually talk about this area as providing capabilities or mechanisms within security products to be able to Predict, Detect, Prevent and Respond to Cyber Security Incidents. As discussed in a previous blog post, in cybersecurity AI and Machine learning are being used to predict what might be coming your way by collecting and analyzing massive amounts of data; to Prevent the most sophisticated malware targeting our customers' networks, and to Detect anomalies on workstations or servers helping with the actual Response to the threat.It is quite interesting to use the same analogy for the public healthcare sector.  AI and Machine learning can help with a whole bunch of areas in healthcare which would benefit from the fast analysis of massive amounts of data.As a security services provider, I wouldn’t want us, Tieto Security Services, to support our customers with less advanced tools than the competition. In a similar fashion, I would want the doctors, researchers, nurses or healthcare workers in the Nordics to have access to the best possible technology advancements. I want them to be able to be proactive, to get help sorting out the signals from the noise, focusing on what is really important – saving people’s lives.Which bring us back to the topic of the cloud.  Do the challenges in using the cloud and AI in the public sector, especially healthcare, boil down to attitudes and legislation? The integrity of patient data (or any personal data, for that matter) is, of course, crucial and must be 100-% certain, but the cloud is nowadays up to the job.What should be done about the two areas which seem to be the main stumbling blocks for the public sector in reaping the benefits of the cloud and AI?If this, and secure cloud adoption, are something you wish to discuss further, please contact me or our team for further information.", Peter Österdahl ,Cybersecurity insights , 19.6.2019
A huge problem: unstructured data is mostly left unprotected,/en/blog/2019/06/left-unprotected/,Cybersecurity insights / Rasa Siegberg / 19.6.2019,"How can we protect this content?In many organizations, people store personal dumps of CRM data for quick and easy access to customer information. Creating these working copies of data may be due to users seeking to avoid the need to re-logging into the system or to avoid being dependent on network connectivity, for example. Many users store a variety of business files on folders in local PCs or in the cloud, and users rather frequently share these with colleagues and partners.From a cybersecurity point-of-view, it is essential to pay attention to how data-in-use is stored: in a structured and an unstructured format. From the perspective of content security, there seems to be a very different level of expected and applied security.Structured data is collected in relational databases on purpose and it is generally well organized and classified. The value and sensitivity of the data is well understood, and it is, consequently, usually well protected as per many relevant regulatory mandates. Most mature organizations have clear processes that address how such data should be handled, who has access, and how this access is protected.The same cannot be said for the unstructured data in shared and personal folders on SharePoint, Dropbox, Google Drive etc. Not to mention the files stored on users’ laptops, computers and email folders. In all of these, there often exists Excel and Word documents about internal and external matters that by their nature and by policy would require strict access control and strong protection. This kind of data is unstructured and heterogeneous – and in many cases unprotected.How to manage the cybersecurity risks of unstructured data?  
Unstructured data clearly poses an important and growing threat. It is a soft target for cybercriminals.Typically, there is little visibility into unstructured data – there is no clear picture of how sensitive it is, where it resides, and how it is protected. Security policies may be unclear, missing or not observed. There is typically limited user guidance, and data ownership may be somewhat undefined.In a recent case, our security team discovered that the customer’s end-users had stored countless snapshots and documents from production databases containing personal data of end-customers. The customer found the situation unacceptable and demanded swift solutions.A straightforward option would be to prevent taking personal copies of structured data. This would, however, have an adverse effect on employees performing their tasks. Another option would be to delete unstructured data to counter the risk, but this too may be asking for trouble in the form of information loss. As usual, the real-life problems call and demand careful study and a working compromise.How to protect unstructured data better?7 steps to protect unstructured dataPerform a mapping of unstructured data. Remember to include cloud assets. As a matter of fact, mapping all potential privacy-related data, including unstructured data, should have been part of GDPR preparations. If it was not, now is the time. 






Classify unstructured data. Data needs classification to determine the appropriate level and method of protection. 






Create data/content protection policies, rules, and processes. 






Create data classification and ownership policies.Implement technical protection measures: encryption with effective key management, DLP(data loss prevention), IAM (identity and access management) and PAM (privileged access management). 






Determine access rights to structured data and rules for legitimate use. 






Educate and guide end-users. For rules and processes to work, they must become routines. Also, urge end-users to delete old files with sensitive business information. 




 


Cloud may complicate the situation and may create novel challenges for data architecture and processes. All organizations will need to address and enforce rules for cloud use. Our advice is to see if similar (or even exactly the same) methods and controls are applicable across cloud, on-premise and hybrid environments. Widely usable security frameworks can turn out to be a competitive advantage.While encryption and key management are important technical methods, they alone are not going to solve the problem: employees need to work with data in a plain-text format, and all data can’t be encrypted (all the time).To control users’ identities and access to data is a security fundamental, which makes effective IAM (including PAM) a must for every organization. It also goes a long way towards preventing authorized access. Without effective IAM, there is no way to control users’ access and entitlements to content, be it structured or not.Why should PAM, privileged access management, always be a core part of IAM? Because it manages and logs systems access of administrators – people who possess the keys to the kingdom, so to speak. We will discuss PAM in detail in our forthcoming blog.As you can see, several organizational and technical steps must be taken to get unstructured data secured. The task may seem overwhelming. A systematical and holistic approach makes it bearable – and you can always turn to us at Tieto Security Services.Do you want to know more about IAM, PAM, DLP and protecting unstructured data? Don’t hesitate to get in touch with us!", Rasa Siegberg ,Cybersecurity insights , 19.6.2019
The color of success: innovative BLUEFIELD™ approach fast-tracks Nordic shift to S/4HANA,/en/blog/2019/06/snp-bluefield-approach/,Cloud / Tiia Kokko / 17.6.2019,"Building digital core for tomorrow's intelligent enterprise is not as simple as moving from A to B. If this were true, CIOs would have much less to worry about these days. Instead, adopting the next generation ERP systems – specifically the market-leading SAP S/4HANA – requires careful assessment of business risks and balancing between business value and potential pitfalls.With the current timetable for implementing S/4HANA before 2025, when SAP has announced it will phase out support for old systems, you would be forgiven for feeling overwhelmed. But with an estimated 50,000 SAP systems worldwide that will need to be updated, you are not alone.Fortunately, there is now good news for companies that want to make the transition to S/4HANA in a safe, adaptable and cost-effective way.Green, brown or blue? The three colors of S/4HANA renewalHow long will an S/4HANA implementation project take and what are the benefits of change? What happens to historical data – will a massive archiving exercise be needed? Can information from newly acquired or divested companies be incorporated or skipped entirely? And what about downtime during the critical launch period – how will business continuity be ensured?My recent visit to SAP's annual conference SAPPHIRE in Orlando, Florida, in May confirmed the sheer number of legitimate concerns that decision makers grapple with on a daily basis. No matter how great the benefits are of adopting smart solutions on top of digital core (advanced analytics, machine learning, IoT, AI), without clear answers to the above questions progress will be hampered. There are just too many layers of complexity – unless helping hands are available.Here is a brief look at the two traditional approaches to implementing SAP S/4HANA:The Greenfield approach: this method of implementing S/4HANA implies complete re-engineering, starting from scratch with new design processes and configurations. This choice could make sense if you want a ""clean slate"" type of transformation and you cannot find any advantages of keeping parts of your current system.
The Brownfield approach: this method involves converting your existing system with a technical upgrade and data migration to S/4HANA technology, keeping current process flows in place without unlocking any new features and functions available in S/4HANA.What are the drawbacks of these two alternatives? The Greenfield option will most likely not appeal to companies already using SAP systems. At the same time, the Brownfield route is a highly complex undertaking for large organizations without any visible business benefits, and it requires massive archiving over months, even years.What's more, there is no guarantee that the Brownfield upgrade option is even technically possible when systems contain large amounts of data. At the very least it would require days of downtime during go-live.The German software provider and consulting firm SNP Group offers a third way called BLUEFIELD™ – combining the best of green and brown – which is now available to Nordic companies thanks to a partnership with Tieto.New horizon: TietoEVRY and SNP Group join forces to accelerate S/4HANAFollowing twelve months of joint preparations, I am proud to be a part of presenting the next phase of TietoEVRY's already long-standing partnership with SNP Group.By combining the software automation and data migration expertise of SNP with TietoEVRY's industry and process knowledge, as well SAP S/4HANA implementation experience, Nordic companies can embark on the journey to S/4HANA with complete confidence and cutting-edge efficiency.Manuel Kutscher of SNP outlined the benefits of the collaboration during the partnership launch at TietoEVRY's headquarters: ""Whether customers are in forestry, manufacturing or retail, this BLUEFIELD™ option means they can pick and choose data flexibly based on individual needs and achieve in days and weeks what previously has taken months and years.""Why choosing TietoEVRY-SNP BLUEFIELD™ is the smart way to goBy contrast to the Greenfield and Brownfield approaches, the BLUEFIELD™ option is suitable for both large and mid-size enterprises that run their businesses in SAP, hence relying on complex data flows for operational excellence.SNP's proven set of tools provide companies with the ability to renew data structures such as legal structures and cost centers, and to retrospectively migrate data to S/4HANA. In addition, they can choose to only migrate selected data that is still valid to their business. This enables massive savings in terms of time, effort, and money for companies with obsolete data in their current systems.From the point of view of business processes, companies often share a similar story – they all want to make the most of new systems. TietoEVRY's SAP expertise and experience can put you on the right track to successful business renewal and, without hassle, help you to leverage innovative solutions on top of the digital core.But that's not all. ""Going blue"" also means you can combine several projects in one single step, which dramatically cuts project time and overall cost.Introducing the new GL (General Ledger) to finance is a good example of how S/4HANA can be implemented in one single step go-live throughout the year, independently of fiscal year-end. Another example – being one of the hot topics when planning S/4HANA move – is the platform transition to the public cloud (e.g. AWS, Azure). This can be done at the same time, too.The 6 key drivers for BLUEFIELD™ accelerated S/4HANA journeyThe ways in which Bluefield brings business value are simply too good to pass up. Here are the six key business situations where the Bluefield™ approach brings the most value:Business continuity – near-zero downtimeLarge enterprises considering the brownfield approach, but thinking that big bang with brownfield is too risky.Selective processes reengineeringEnterprises who want to combine both approaches: reuse current investments with selected existing processes and re-engineer certain selected processes on the fly.Data headacheEnterprises with large amount of data who want to benefit from a selective migration approach, and who are willing to skip the painful archiving exercise in the current system.Structural changesEnterprises wanting to harmonize or simplify existing structural elements such as company code, controlling area, profit centers, etc in a single step, with retrospective data build-up for historical data.Landscape restructuringEnterprises running several SAP or non-SAP systems looking to simplify and consolidate systems on their journey to S/4HANA.Organizational restructuringEnterprises undergoing mergers and acquisitions or carve-outs who want to go for a combination approach on their journey to S/4HANA.All in all, BLUEFIELD™ means that introducing S/4HANA can be a journey fully tailored to your company's needs, maximizing business value with minimal disruption to operations regardless of different time zones for go-live.Together with SNP Group, which already looks back on a long list of successful implementations where the power of S/4HANA has been unlocked in as little as eight months, we look forward to helping Nordic companies secure a position at the forefront of SAP innovation.Read more about how to jumpstart S/4HANA and accelerate the transition with an automated System Scan, in my next blog post coming soon.

"Top 10 recommendations for marketing automation design, implementation and rollout",/en/blog/2019/05/top-10-recommendations-for-marketing-automation-design-implementation-and-rollout/,Data / Marko Saarinen / 22.5.2019,"Marketing automation should be seen as one component in a larger (eco)system that generates a consistent customer experience. Below we have compiled a list that explores some of the most battle-proven ways to address and overcome so called “special issues” and leverage marketing automation in an optimal way.Customer experience metrics and their links to financial and business metrics
Knowing your customer
Customer segmentation
High-quality data
Single view of the customer
Meaningful customer communication
Marketing automation as part of the (eco)system
Maturity of your customer experience infrastructure
Sales and marketing alignment
Being honest = stopping to pretend you can do it all by yourselfThese issues need to be understood and taken into account when designing, implementing and rolling out your marketing automation system as part of successful customer acquisition and customer engagement programmes.1. Customer experience metrics and their links to financial and business metricsCustomer analytics drives important decisions in customer (experience) strategy. It should be well integrated into every customer-facing process. Customer analytics initiatives often fail when they are not properly tied back to business and financial metrics. This is critical as customer analytics is increasingly used to guide decisions that drive business metrics across the entire customer lifecycle. In addition, organisations with a high maturity level in the customer acquisition and customer engagement domain use formal ROI methodologies to build a solid business case for marketing automation investments which, in turn, requires a solid relationship between customer-related metrics and financial and business metrics.Figure 1 Focused metrics at multiple levels and measured performance2. Know your customerThe reality is that most companies target the wrong person, in the wrong channel, and at the wrong time with the wrong content and experiences. What could be worse than promoting a product or service to a customer that has just purchased that product or service?To avoid this, you need to know your customer. By combining business data (such as transactional data), customer profile data, activity data (such as interaction and engagement data from digital and physical channels) and support data (such as customer service data), you can gain a good insight into your customers at the individual level. This allows triggering the right actions to every individual in a personalised way, driving more meaningful customer relationships.Figure 2 Know Your Customer with four data types3. Customer segmentationDoes it make sense to approach all customers and prospects with the same message? The answer is most probably “no”. However, a shortage of time and resources tend to be the most common reasons (or excuses) for not doing any segmentation work or at least avoiding the use of segmentation work and data to drive more personalised and profitable customer engagements.Combining profile, activity and business data is the key underlying a foundation for understanding customer motivation, preferences and even intent. Through customer segmentation, you can personalise the message and experiences in the right channel.The emergence of modern technologies, such as machine learning, has enabled organisations to leverage dynamic segmentation. Segments updated dynamically, constantly and in real time allow you to interact with your customers in real time, be sure that your segments are constantly updated and show your customers highly relevant products with proper communications.4. High-quality dataIt is hard to name an industry that has not been affected by data-driven digital disruption. The marketing function is no exception. Data is the root of most of today’s marketing decisions. The most productive and customer-obsessed companies approach data as a collaborative effort. They understand that their success often relies on seamless collaboration between marketing, data owners and IT. Their primary goal is to reduce the amount of time it takes to answer the questions marketing asks most, as well as to enable marketing to experiment with “what if” scenarios that take the business forward.Figure 3 Data - the best way to learn to know your customer5. Single view of the customerBroken customer experiences start to emerge when different organisations or business units within an organisation work in silos and communicate to and interact with the customer in different, inconsistent ways. The impact of these silos can be felt in the form of operational inefficiency, wasted resources, higher customer and personnel churn, and lower-than-average or even negative business growth, profitability, and customer satisfaction.Figure 4 Broken Customer ExperiencesBy generating a single view of the customer with a unified marketing technology ecosystem, set of processes and governance model, you can understand customer intent and fulfil their needs in every conversation and interaction. In addition, this provides the possibility to take advantage of every customer touchpoint for educating the customer, upselling, cross-selling, or predictive winback. On top of this, every interaction represents a prime opportunity to enrich customer data for higher conversion in all future interactions and conversations.6. Meaningful customer communicationBy mapping your customer journeys, you improve your chances to offer meaningful customer communication at every stage of the customer lifecycle: attracting, converting, closing and engaging. Various tactics can be used at these four stages to fulfil the needs of the target audience and to lure them to the next lifecycle stage.These tactics aim, in the first phase, to create awareness and raise needs in order to get an anonymous person to visit the website. In the second phase, you build trust and credibility in the eyes of the website visitor so that the visitor becomes a lead. In the third phase, you facilitate the decision so that the lead becomes a customer. After that, you ensure that the customer remains loyal to you (the fourth phase).7. Marketing automation as part of the (eco)systemTypically, marketing automation is seen as a set of standalone, isolated email-based campaigns instead of always-on, perpetual programmes. Focusing only on your email marketing strategy seriously undermines the potential that marketing automation has in significantly improving your customer acquisition and customer engagement results. An enterprise-scale marketing automation platform used as a pure email marketing or newsletter tool is simply overkill. Instead, marketing automation should be seen as the key technology enabler for orchestrating your omnichannel customer experience. The programmatic approach is often far more consistent with the way buyers buy – repeatedly instead of for a predefined period. The programme also focuses on engaging, nurturing and converting buyers with relevant content and experiences that align with their needs and buying process.It is really the broader marketing ecosystem (system of systems) that defines the customer experience. It is about the orchestrated impact of marketing automation, CRM, customer analytics, web CMS, intelligent personalisation, and – quite easily – dozens of other systems and technologies combined with their smart use that makes a big difference.Figure 5 Marketing automation is part of a system8. Maturity of your customer experience infrastructureMost of today’s marketers fully recognise the importance of marketing technology to delivering a superior customer experience. However, organisations’ technological capabilities are often still quite far away from living up to the level needed for a high-quality customer experience. It is a real challenge to keep things simple and relevant for customers when dealing with the complexity of legacy customer experience infrastructure.Figure 6 CX System of Insight InfrastructureWithout joined-up customer experience infrastructure, it is an inevitable struggle for marketers to gain a 360-degree view of the customer across different touchpoints – let alone deliver automation and personalisation through the right channels at the right time. Your marketing automation system must be seen in the context of a larger ecosystem of systems and technologies with clear roles and governance models across them to avoid excessive overlapping functionality and data. It is also important to remember that when it comes to delivering a superior customer experience, effective use of technology and effective use of high-quality, sufficiently complete data tend to go together.9. Sales and marketing alignmentSales and marketing alignment is really about the customer. This alignment also represents the biggest opportunity available today for improving business performance. Sales and marketing success only works when both sides work towards shared goals.There are many critical areas where this alignment should be seamless – from creating customer segments and funnel stages together to documenting content gaps along the customer journey to working out a well-defined lead handover process (from a marketing-qualified lead to a sales-qualified lead) to keeping track of and measuring every interaction your customers have with your company. Above all, make all this visible, understandable, and actionable through closed-loop reporting, tracking and holding both teams accountable through dashboards and reporting, and simply keeping the sales and marketing communication flowing.Figure 7 Systematic approach to leads10. Being honest = stopping to pretend you can do it all by yourselfWe realise that technology changes at an exponential rate, but human organisations do not change that quickly. The marketing technology landscape is changing very rapidly (and this will NOT slow down during the next few years), but organisations’ own use of marketing technology is evolving “only” slightly or not at all. This must be combined with the harsh reality that there will always be a limited number of changes in people, processes and technology that any organisation can truly absorb within a given timeframe.However, this is not impossible to manage. It is important to understand and decide which technology changes are relevant for your organisation and which to embrace for the greatest business impact. Focus on those that best align with your company's strategic direction and priorities. Also, think of the business and organisational capabilities required to become more agile in accelerating the rate at which you can absorb changes. Explore the practices, such as lean and agile marketing, and how to adopt and leverage them in marketing. You don’t need to do this alone. Outside help is available.Figure 8 Martech LawTo summarise what is needed to move to the next level with marketing automation:Begin with analytics to gain customer understanding. After that, move towards adapting marketing parameters and programmes to customer response. Furthermore, you should uncover patterns of usage behaviour to broaden your understanding through every customer interaction and then optimise and grow “more intelligent”. In the end, driving customer acquisition, customer development and customer retention are the key roles for marketing automation.Interested in hearing more?

Two reasons why SAP S/4HANA Outsourcing certification matters when bridging the digital gap,/en/blog/2019/05/two-reasons-why-sap-s4hana-outsourcing-certification-matters-when-bridging-the-digital-gap/,Cloud / Tiia Kokko / 21.5.2019,"Would you trust a dentist without qualified training? What about if your dish washer breaks down and water starts leaking on your wood floor. Who would you prefer to call to fix the problem?The job of helping companies maximize user experiences and speed up processes in the digital age is clearly more complex than the scenarios above. But the same basic principle applies – we all prefer to use certified experts with proven skills and capabilities, whatever their field of expertise.That’s why, over the past five years, Tieto has embarked on a journey to certify as many of our SAP-based portfolio services as possible. And it’s time to celebrate yet another important achievement.New certification success: SAP Applications Operations for S/4HANATieto has more than 25 years’ experience of solving problems for customers and enabling their businesses to run smoothly, while empowering them using next generation technologies in the SAP toolbox. With over 800 SAP consultants, we’re the frontrunner in S/4-enabled digital core renewals in the Nordic region.We are proud to announce our new level of certification – this time for SAP Applications Operations which relates to Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) for S/4HANA. Once again Tieto is the first service provider in the Nordics to achieve this level of certification. And it comes at an opportune moment as more and more companies begin to recognize the transformative impact of SAP S/4HANA on business operations.The ALM certification for S/4HANA follows two previous milestones for Tieto in the world of SAP. In 2016, we implemented the first SAP S/4HANA project in the Nordics, completing the task in just ten weeks for a customer in the forestry industry. Then, in 2017, we became the only service provider worldwide to achieve a Gold certificate for SAP Application Lifecycle Management.Full stack capabilities – carefree assistanceHow will our certification for SAP applications benefit you as a customer? For a start, it means that the way we deliver SAP S/4HANA application projects has received the highest stamp of approval. But it also goes further to include our full stack capabilities.The audit confirmed that all of our processes and methodologies follow SAP’s best practices which also includes our infrastructure services. This significantly reduces risks, particularly escalating costs, that you might be exposed to in the transition to SAP S/4HANA.The feedback from SAP’s auditor was very positive stating that Tieto’s maturity level is “comparable to any global provider.”At its simplest, choosing a certified SAP partner allows you to do two things:• Stay ahead of the curve: any glitches in the transition to cutting edge SAP technology not only results in high costs but also lost time, business and innovation capacity, which increases the likelihood of falling behind competitors. Choosing a certified SAP S/4HANA partner helps you to mitigate these risks.• Broaden the horizon: Focus on developing your business in the digital era without worrying about obstacles such as data integration. With a certified partner you can rely on continuous support from an internationally recognized SAP provider.Our next step on this exciting certification journey is the SAP DevOps certification – watch this space.", Tiia Kokko ,Cloud , 21.5.2019

At least, I don't know anything about my colleagues' religion, or marital or financial status, so we don't have a problem with inclusion, right?One training session later, I find myself re-evaluating that statement. It turns out that our biases are often unconscious, and most of us have a few that we may not be aware of. So this training is needed by all of us.From unconscious bias to a truly inclusive workplaceI want Tieto to be a great place to work for everybody. As a company in an industry that already has a substantial labour shortage, we need to find ways of including more people and making use of all the available talent. I strongly believe that our staff are one of our key differentiators on the market.

How will 5G and network slicing revolutionize business?,/en/blog/2019/01/how-will-5g-and-network-slicing-revolutionize-business/,Cloud / Mikel Echegoyen / 29.1.2019,"One of the most interesting technical innovation is network slicing – the ability to slice the network in different “virtual networks” that are designed to meet the different requirements of usage, for example real-time communications or services requiring high capacity.5G implementations speeding across industriesThe commercial launch of 5G seems to be approaching faster than originally expected, and announcements are becoming an everyday thing, not only in the USA but also in the Nordics: ""AT&T Reveals First Commercial 5G Device"", ""T-Mobile and Ericsson Sign Major 3.5 Billion Dollar 5G Agreement"", ""5G-ready subscriptions already sold by Elisa"" etc.Now is a good time to start thinking about the opportunities that 5G will bring to your businesses as well. 5G will not be a technology that only brings more bandwidth compared to previous generation mobile networks. It will also enable widespread usage and utilization across many industries, due to its capacity, flexibility, and the fact that it was designed to serve different needs in an optimal way. It will enable a fully connected smart society of the future.Top three 5G innovations5G will introduce a large number of revolutionary technical innovations and improvements to 4G technology. The three most important elements of 5G can be summarized as follows:Network slicing introduces the ability to slice the network into different ""virtual networks"" that are designed to meet the needs of specific user groups.
5GNR (5G New Radio) includes new frequencies, radio technology and advanced antenna technologies that radically improve radio performance.
The main improvements in evolved 5G network architecture are cloud-native Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs), automated orchestration and the deployment of Radio Access Network (vRAN).The power of network slicingNetwork slicing is, in my opinion, the most interesting 5G technology – and also a technology which is quite often not fully understood.Network slicing can be described as the ability to create ""isolated virtual networks"" in 5G. These virtual networks can have different design parameters for bandwidth, latency, reliability, security, coverage and service levels and thus be designed to serve specific application/solution needs optimally over the same 5G physical radio and core infrastructure.For example, an IoT network or solution can utilize a Network Slice that is optimized for the real-time delivery of small information pieces from sensors that are distributed widely apart from each other. On the other hand, a video streaming service needs to have high bandwidth as its main parameter in order to optimize and guarantee great HD quality video broadcasting or streaming service.5G and network slicing technology will, for the first time, serve the needs of low latency communication services.Network slicing impacting industriesNetwork Slicing offers an optimized channel that has not been available before. A great example of the impact of 5G and network slicing comes from the automotive industry and connected vehicles.With a dedicated network slice, vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity will be achieved in real-time. This enables transferring relevant, up-to-the-minute information about road conditions, traffic data, and other potential changing conditions to the vehicle. However, the same vehicle will also be receiving advertisements & news streaming data for big screens through another network slice. This data does not require a ""real-time"" network slice as a delivery channel, instead it uses a high-bandwidth optimized network slice.In the 5G environment, different solutions and applications will be supported much more optimally than in a network which has only one ""multi-service"" network capability to offer. 5G operators can offer tailored slices and therefore also enable the design of different kinds of new applications and solutions with optimal network slice support present. We at Tieto are involved in developing slicing technology and in increasing the number of solutions that utilize network slicing.This is why it is good to start planning and piloting new applications within 5G ecosystems and test available networks. Learn and optimize how 5G can accelerate or enable new application businesses.5G is not in the distant future, it is the technology of today. It will enable applications and solutions that were not possible or feasible in the past. Now is the perfect time to start thinking about how your business can benefit from 5G. We are exploring the potential of 5G as well!Just recently, Tietoevry announced a new strategic partnership around 5G with Telia.Read more about how to harness the power of 5G networks to build innovative 5G solutions.", Mikel Echegoyen ,Cloud , 29.1.2019

There are four things that all successful Cybersecurity Operations have in common. They will be the cornerstones on which your Cybersecurity Operations rests.“Cybersecurity Operations is the process that tells us what we need to do to ensure a strong cyber defense”Before we look at the recipe of a successful Security Operations, it is important to understand that Cybersecurity Operations is not a physical Center. Yes, the Security Operations Center is an important contributor, but Cybersecurity Operations is the process that tells us what we need to do to ensure a strong cyber defense.So, if you want to be successful in your Cybersecurity Operations, you need these four capabilities at hand.1. Protection and PreventionDesign and implement the necessary security controls (Endpoint protection, Next Gen Firewall, IAM etc.) needed to prevent and protect against attacks in all attack phases. Policies and technology should empower each other to reach highest level of effectiveness. And start quantifying* your efforts and effectiveness.2. Detection""Assume breach"" is the guiding principle of most large organizations today. And to detect a breach that was not prevented you need to monitor, correlate, enrich and analyze threat and vulnerability intelligence collected from both internal as well as external sources. Don't forget to quantify* your efforts and effectiveness.3. ResponseWhen a breach is detected, the accuracy of your response will be very much determined by the quality of your detection. Investigate the incident and remediate as fast as possible to limit the damage. Quantify*!4. AdaptionYour Cybersecurity capabilities needs to constantly evolve, and the evolution is mostly fueled by three main influences;A) IncidentsIf you have been measuring your efforts and effectiveness, it is not that difficult to realize what you need to do in order to minimize the risk of happening again.B) External changesYou have to constantly adapt to changes in the threat landscape.C) Internal changesYour organizational and business needs will change as you develop and adopt new digital services and business models.Your ability to adapt and evolve your Cybersecurity Operations will determine your future success in terms of cyber resilience. But it will also help you maintain control and efficiency of your cybersecurity spending.Reach out to me if you want to learn the fastest road to success.*Quantify what and where, so that you can measure your cybersecurity effectiveness. Which defense efforts have been deployed, and where have they been implemented? Which threats have you encountered (both that you managed to protect against, as well as those that has been detected after breach) and where?

How to share sensitive data efficiently? Tokenize it!,/en/blog/2018/11/how-to-share-sensitive-data-efficiently-tokenize-it/,Cloud / Tietoevry at your service / 8.11.2018,"In the payment industry, tokenization is a common and well-known way to protect transactions and payment data of point-of-sales systems and applications. Recently, the method has started to spread to other industries and new use cases, especially in the cloud.The funny aspect is that tokenization is an ancient concept. However, it is now utilized for new problems either to replace or complement other means to protect data.Tokenization is a way to obfuscate sensitive data such as a social security number by converting it into a random string of characters. That string is called a token.Tokens are stored in a database called a token vault, which stores the relationship between the original piece of data and the token. Whenever someone tries to access tokenized data, the token handler will verify whether he/she has the right to read detokenized data.Tokenization ≠ encryptionSome might ask if tokenization is just a version of encryption. It isn’t.Encryption obfuscates data by a complex mathematical algorithm. In symmetric key encryption, the very same algorithm can also be used for returning ciphered data into the plain text value.Benefits of tokenization:No way to reverse engineer tokens to original data.
Stolen tokens possess no risk to data security.
Low demand for computing.
Suitable even for IoT security.Tokenization involves no keys but only random characters. If an intruder steals tokens, they are useless and harmless because there is no way to reverse engineer the real data behind a token. In case of a data breach, this improves cybersecurity.Additionally, encryption is always an intensive computing process whereas tokenization requires very little processing power and is very fast. That makes tokenization useful even in IoT security because typical IoT devices have weak processors and require low power consumption.Analyze data assets with little riskFor organizations, tokenization offers a number of benefits especially to protect personal data in the cloud.It may be used either as an option to encryption or in combination with encryption depending on the requirements of the use case or regulation. In many cases, neither encryption nor tokenization alone is enough or a viable solution.Four use cases drive tokenization at the moment:GDPR: tokenization help ensure compliance and minimize data breach risks.
Cloud: tokenization help protect identities in cloud services.
Analytics: tokenization provides a method to pseudonymize big data assets of personal data and to enable data processing.
Application development outsourcing: tokenizing data makes it easier to give data assets for outsourced developers.
GDPR is the main factor that has brought tokenization to discussions during the last couple of years. Tokenization provides a relatively simple method to obfuscate personal data and thus fulfil regulatory requirements.Cloud usage may be the single biggest driver of tokenization. Many organizations have data of their staff and/or customers that are partially sensitive, and that identifies individuals, but they also have to use data in cloud-based applications and transactions. A secure way to use such data is to convert the sensitive fields into tokens before transmitting it into the cloud. Tokenization can be performed by in-house applications, or by tokenization as a service platforms offered by some cloud security vendors.A third big driver is related to both GDPR and cloud. Organizations know that their massive data assets with personal and enterprise data would provide valuable insight for reaching their business targets, but performing analysis of such data requires careful risk management. If sensitive data is converted into tokens, it ceases to be personal data, and it can be analyzed en masse without risks.Finally, application development often requires data assets, even sensitive ones. But a big headache is trusted if development is outsourced as it usually is. Once sensitive data is tokenized, you are safer.It’s easy to understand why the use of tokenization is increasing. This efficient method has certain drawbacks, but organizations can benefit from a hybrid strategy of tokenization and encryption to simplify cybersecurity – and to gain more value from the data assets.Are you interested to know more about protecting your assets by tokenization?

Harness your SAP system to the core of your Intelligent Enterprise,/en/blog/2018/11/harness-your-sap-system-to-the-core-of-your-intelligent-enterprise/,Cloud / Tiia Kokko / 8.11.2018,"During the industrial revolution, people feared that jobs would run out, just like they do today. But products became readily available for more and more people, demand grew and completely new jobs and industries were born.The ongoing technology transformation has been coined the fourth industrial revolution and the era of intelligence. What does this transformation mean to companies running on SAP? How can you harness the system to serve your business in a changing world?Software at the core of strategySAP has opened a Nordic Experience Center in Copenhagen. We had the opportunity of visiting it with Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish user groups.Before the much awaited Hands-on part of the visit, Jesper Schleimann, CTO SAP EMEA North, gave a presentation on “How to become an Intelligent Enterprise?” The title sounded very familiar to an old BI consultant, but the contents of Intelligence had risen to a completely new level.Software is already at the core of the strategy of many traditional companies, regardless of their industry. Business is moving towards demand sensing, automonous pull economy, where customers pay based on outcome , such as compressed air or a hole in the wall.SAP with its own algorithms is amongst the three largest companies globally in machine learning, and by 2020 its goal is to automate 60 % of work conducted in workplaces, while the general forecast is to achieve this by 2025.A few facts were surprising. 77 % of the world’s transaction revenue is in SAP systems and SAP is used in 25 industries. SAP also holds the world’s largest business network; this doubtless refers to Ariba. Taking this scale into consideration SAP has genuinely managed to recreate itself.More genuine optionsClearly over half of SAP’s turnover comes from cloud products. This probably includes SAP’s infraservice SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud, but nevertheless the share is significant. S/4HANA is now available as a localized SaaS solution. Juhani Sysimetsä opens this up further in his own blog.SAP’s most significant new launch and answer to competition is C/4HANA. It is a packaged collection of both SAP’s own CRM products and also newer (Core systems) and older (Hybris) acquisitions. For customers this means more genuine options, as SAP is seriously investing into developing this area with its strong native integrations and master data management, also taking into consideration the strong core, i.e. S/4HANA.C/4HANA portfolio combined with an indirect, i.e. digital usage licensing costs in case of 3rd party product, SAP has good potential for growth in customer experience.Innovation with and without Lego blocksAs we were in Denmark, we also got a chance to play with Lego blocks. Without giving too much of the plot away, I can reveal that the demonstrations had to do with IoT and its different kinds of sensors and business applications, as well as machine learning with SAP Leonardo.Many of us were quickly inspired by the examples and started thinking about how to apply the technology for our own business needs. It is worthwhile to start using SAP Cloud Platform and Leonardo, and also learn a Design Thinking approach to innovation culture already now, even if your S/4HANA transformation is not due for several years.Culture and new competence are not developed fast and moving and renewing tailored solutions from the ""core” to the cloud takes time as well. You can read more about this topic in Jouko Juuti’s blog.Innovation services from a shipping container and a partnerSAP offers innovation services in various forms, such as SAP Mobile Innovation Lab, in which a transportable shipping container is brought to the customer to accelerate development. If the idea is sufficiently novel and different, SAP may facilitate the venture without separate cost.Tieto also offers similar services.

The framework for immersive experience design,/en/blog/2018/09/the-framework-for-immersive-experience-design/,Data / Ksenia Avetisova / 28.9.2018,"When moving at fast speed, racing against the time, we tend to combine intuition with acclaimed design frameworks and thus results are always unpredictable. For the past 3 years I have been driving the enhanced reality experiments at Tieto XR Lab, and I’d like to share a few thoughts on the framework that can serve as a guiding principle to achieve successful outcomes in creating innovative concepts with the use of disruptive technology components.Virtual and Augmented reality technology is familiar to most of the decision makers in our clients organizations, yet they are still somewhat far from the mass adoption on all levels of business structures. It is also difficult for most to grasp the allusive practical difference between Augmented and Mixed reality approach. For the past years we’ve seen a lot of pilots, initiatives to test out new hardware in search of the WOW effect, as well as more targeted service design engagements that sought to solve the existing problems in a new way. What has been lacking up to now is the generalized framework to provide clarity in XR initiatives and allow to measure the holistic impact in the bigger context.The XR experience can be assessed on each of the following layers:1. Conceptual layer - how well the concept is supporting the needs or a target audience2. Data layer - the use of data in solving the given challenge3. Senses layer - how the immersive experience feels for the user4. Visual layer - the visual look and feel of experience components5. Interactive layer - the interaction layer of the experience as well as its relation to other xr experiencesThis framework is being developed during Elena Malakhatka’s PHD project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden and is used in our latest collaborative project connected to digital twins of the apartments and simulation of processes in virtual reality. One of the top benefits of adopting the ecosystem approach in designing innovative solutions is that the sum is always greater than each individual part. Academia and business engaged in collaboration move much faster forward, creating not only business driven results, but also frameworks that can serve as reference to future initiatives.We are proud to be nominated to the Auggie Awards 2018!

PSD2: Game changer or not?,/en/blog/2018/09/psd2-game-changer-or-not/,Data / Kaarle Honkamaa / 3.9.2018,"Game gets realWith PSD2, operating in an Account Information Service Providers (AISP) / Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP) role requires a proper license and puts you under regulation. This means it's no longer a Fintech playground and we are likely to see banks entering this area with their own services. So far, the banks, with the heavy regulatory and legal burden have felt this to be a “grey area”. Now many traditional ASPSPs (i.e. banks) will join the party and start offering multibank services to their customers via accessing the PSD2 interfaces of other banks. This also means we are likely to see more new entrants from outside the financial sector adopting Payment Initiation Service (PIS) and Account Information Service (AIS) functions in their business processes.
Must move for banks
From the banks’ perspective, providing AIS and PIS services is about defending your position as a primary customer facing point for everyday banking. It is expected that most banks will react and start offering multibank services to their own customers by integrating this functionality into existing services. Banks are challenged because if they don't act, someone else will offer these services to their customers.
At first, end customers will likely get the similar kind of services from their existing bank that the fintechs have offered thus far. Even though banks are slower movers with their legacy systems compared to a fintech, they have one major advantage over fintechs and other new entrants: trust. After all it’s about people’s money and with today’s security breaches and vulnerabilities, trust is a big thing.
In longer term, as dust settles and PSD2 progresses towards open banking, banks can choose different roles for service production; staying 100% in control of both production and distribution of products and services, distributing own services via third parties or distributing products and services created by third parties by providing a platform for Third Party Providers (TPPs) - resulting in a more diversified service offering for customers.
Opportunity to differentiate and go beyond PSD2
Banks also have a good opportunity to take services enabled by PSD2 to the next level via contextuality to the transaction data. Contextuality means for example enriching the transaction data with information such as e-invoice and e-receipt. This will multiply the use case possibilities compared to raw PSD2 data and might give competitive advantage over other players in the market.
Many banks are now thinking about possibilities beyond PSD2. They have understood that the change is evitable, and to stay alive, you need to look beyond. With PSD2, banks will adopt the necessary level of competence working with open APIs and seeking competitive advantage will push them to leverage this beyond PSD2. In fact, in many banks, other product teams are closely following the progress of PSD2. This movement will be bank driven, not regulatory.
End customer expectation and trust leading the way
The big question is how fast customer expectations towards the new financial services will change and how big a role the trust factor will play. Customer demand does not change overnight but the expectation level is already set by other industries that have undergone a similar change over the last decade. One thing is for sure: the wait-and-see strategy is very risky.

Digitalisation is a hot topic at management level, but fewer than half of the survey’s respondents (43%) have a business strategy for digitalisation. A slight increase from the previous year is visible, though, and we anticipate the trend to continue.
Large companies, understandably, are in the lead as far as strategies go, although the gap is slowly closing. Small companies are perhaps more risk-averse and thereby more inclined to pick proven practices from other players than taking the initiative in an unknown area.
Nevertheless, copying what works for other companies is no guarantee that the same works for your company, which is why it would be good for every company to formulate the digital strategy and initiatives from their own point of view.
Innovation seen as interesting, yet challenging
Today, the forest industry, by and large, is doing well. Funds are available for innovation, and the interest in the area is high. The big few are leading in this area as well, working with nimble, small startups for quick results.
In contrast, smaller companies, around 40 per cent of the survey respondents, do not have a specific structure for digital innovation. We see this as a major issue – they would probably benefit from a more structured way of working on innovation, including proven methodologies such as Design Thinking or similar. To remain relevant in an industry in a constant flux, it is important for the smaller and mid-size players to step up their pace of innovation to prevent being left behind.
Digital opens doors to commercial opportunities
A high percentage of forest industry companies are optimistic about digital opportunities, although most of their interest is focused on increased productivity and efficiency instead of innovation.
One especially important area, which places second right after using real-time data for increased efficiency, is user experience.
More and more forest owners are living and working in cities, becoming somewhat alienated from tending and cutting their forests. The forest industry is facing a purchasing dilemma: how to get a sufficient influx of high-quality raw material from less and less interested sellers?
Solutions already exist or are emerging for visualising and communicating what is happening in the forest, but interaction with the forest owner needs to take a huge leap forward to point out what the owner can benefit by managing the forest in a certain way and selling the wood, or, conversely, lose by not doing anything.
Another area with great benefit potential is the B2B aspect. For the pulp industry, for example, it is important to know the dryness of the raw material, essentially meaning how long it has taken for the material to arrive from the cutting site to the woodyard. This information is available from harvesters, but lost on the way. The gaps caused by missing links in the digital chain must be filled to make the information accessible and usable.
Yet more cost-efficiency is within reach in transport. When one truck transports timber for different companies, it at worst needs three separate transport systems. Exchanging transport information between all actors in the ecosystem could be solved through a central, digital data repository accessible to everyone. This will enable economies of scale through a consolidated industry transport resource.
What is the next digital breakthrough?
In the light of the survey findings, Swedish forest industry companies are predominantly aiming at increasing efficiency, even though they might benefit more from placing their bets on innovation – especially around how to secure a steady flow of raw material – in the present market situation. The image below shows the areas the industry is now focusing on.

NIS directive in the Nordics: Finnkampen in the air?,/en/blog/2018/09/nis-directive-in-the-nordics-finnkampen-in-the-air/,Digitalization / Maria Nordgren / 28.8.2018,"The GDPR triggered a large response in the EU for personal data rights and motivated a series of compliance activities across industries not only within the EU but also in the rest of the world. We’ve entered into a new era. But this was only one (loud) leg of a larger effort by the EU in digitalization.A quieter yet equally significant effort is embodied in the Network Information Security Directive(NISD). NISD is the first cyber security law in Europe. NISD’s core message is that essential service operators and digital service providers must take proportionate measures to ensure their information infrastructure is ‘secure’; manage incidents in a way that their business continuity is immune to debilitating information security disruptions; and report any significant breaches to authorities. 
Cyber security still feels like a novel, highly technical and abstract field of practice to many. What do even those obligations entail in practice? Can we be considered to have done our job if we have the best anti-virus protection and lots of encryption? Not by a long shot. Compliance with the NISD entails a number of information security measures and processes which are not limited to upgrading your applications and protective tools. There are simply no short-cuts to being “cyber secure”.  
Cyber security law for Finland
The EU countries were required to have their national law implementing the NIS Directive already by May 2018. Each country is free to implement the NISD in the way they find appropriate. Tieto’s native country Finland is diverging from its sister Sweden in this one.
Sweden has published a new law (Informationssäkerhet för samhällsviktiga och digitala tjänster) as well as a substantive document on the implementation of the NIS Directive (some 300 pages).
Finland, on the other hand, has opted for the granular approach and merely amended the sector-based legislation instead of passing a new law. You can almost feel the signature of the famously minimalist and functional Finnish design in Finland’s legislative practice (In Finland, we use words economically). In total, eleven Finnish codes have changed to accommodate NIS-related obligations across the ‘essential services’ and digital service industries.
So, what awaits the Finnish industry actors?
The short answer: Finland will probably experience a bit more uncertainty around the sanctions of failure to comply with the cyber security obligations than their Swedish counterparts. Our reliable government sources have indicated that the reason for Finland in choosing to stay silent about the NIS-related penalties is that the existing sector-based legislation sufficiently regulates the matter of sanctions and penalties.
It appears that of the two major groups of sectors on which the NIS obligations apply, the OES (operators of essential services such as the energy sector, healthcare and finance) are set to be left with more uncertainty than the DSPs (digital service providers) in terms of the administrative sanctions and penalties.
The obligatory breach notifications will have to be made to the sectoral authorities. So, if you have gone through a disruption which has a significant impact on the business continuity, and you are operating in the transport sector, you need to notify the Finnish Transport Safety Agency (Liikenteen turvallisuusvirasto).  
What should you be doing before the year begins?
When you are operating in the ‘business of trust’ such as finance or healthcare, it is the value set by that trust that drives your business. When you are operating in energy, transport or digital services infrastructures, it is the reliability of your operations that maintain the value of your business. Thus, the primary driver of your success will always be to maintain the trust of your customers that you protect their data, their operability and their business continuity.
On the cyber security front, you need to ensure that you have committed the internal resources to become compliant for the NIS. For that, prepare yourself to take  action in three major cyber-security fields: 

Risk management,
Implementation of state-of-the-art security measures, and
Incident management procedures.

Equipped with Tieto’s long-standing customer experience and excellent capabilities in cyber-security service, we are here to offer you our comprehensive NIS Consultancy customized for the industry you are operating in.

Agile development can boost business development without causing extra costs,/en/blog/2018/08/agile-development-can-boost-business-development-without-causing-extra-costs/,Cloud / Markku Luoma-Aho / 14.8.2018,"The traditional development methods are often costly, slow and the result, whenever they are ready to use, don’t fulfil expectations regarding scope and business targets. This makes agile development a valid alternative. Yet before we advise you on development we have to understand your business. What is the best way forward for us to succeed?Knowing our customerTo begin, we need to understand who you are and what you want to accomplish. We have to know your business, what you want, your goals and fears. We need to understand your knowledge, capabilities and way of working.There can be real value bringing in a partner like Tieto. Our target is to help find the best business ideas, and your self-analysed goals might not be the best you can do. Moreover, we have the capability to lead development.One of our maxims is to do it for the customer as if we are doing it for ourselves. We would never deliver an application unless we would use it in our own business. Partnering with agile development fits right into this philosophy.Be fast and flexibleAgile development involves cross-functional teams using adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement and flexible responses to change. We can also throw DevOps, supporting tools and flexible environments into the conversation: the unification of development, operations and infrastructure.The main benefits of these practices are speed and flexibility, as well as increased innovation, which can have a direct impact on your bottom line. If all goes well you can lower development costs and get to market sooner, beating the competition and boosting your sales. Many people claim it is more fun to work with agile development methods, and of course it can result in impressive results as long as discipline is used during the process.Sometimes there are challenges, be they organisational impediments, unrealistic expectations, trying to apply agile development to inappropriate projects or bringing in the wrong partners.

How to grow and differentiate in a commodity market,/en/blog/2018/07/how-to-grow-and-differentiate-in-a-commodity-market/,Cloud / Markku Luoma-Aho / 30.7.2018,"The Nordic pension and insurance markets can be seen as commodity markets. Pensions are highly regulated while the insurance market has a lack of innovation and competition from novel solutions in the most profitable and high-volume products, such as traffic and employers’ mandatory accident insurance. If you want to grow your business in such an environment you need to differentiate yourself and offer something the customer can’t get elsewhere.Improving the customers’ lives
The best way to differentiate and grow your business is to focus on the lives of the end customer. You want to make their lives better and easier. New kinds of services will lure them to you.
For example, let’s say you are targeting entrepreneurs. Everyone offers loans, banking and mandatory insurance products, so you also develop innovative services. Perhaps you can offer them a marketplace: accounting, legal advice, headhunting, networking with investors… and, of course, your financial solutions.
It is not enough to simply offer a good customer experience anymore. You need to be in the customers’ daily lives, offering real added value. For example, how many companies do you have to call if you have a car accident? The insurance company, tow truck, mechanic, rental car company? What if you had one service number that took care of all of that? This is real value in the P&C market.
Ecosystems add value
Many companies focus on existing customers and pay less attention to marketing and onboarding new customers. This will be exacerbated with the SOTE reform in Finland, challenging the ability to keep current customers.
The solution might be an ecosystem which provides innovative products and services, adds value and provides real results. The modern era is the era of collaboration, not conglomeration.
Ecosystems have their own challenges, not least how they are financed. Yet if you can enable an ecosystem which finds common targets and benefits for all members you create an environment which adds value to the end customer and helps you grow in a commodity market.

The introduction of APIs and standards made easy,/en/blog/2018/07/the-introduction-of-apis-and-standards-made-easy/,Digitalization / Edgars Bremze  / 20.7.2018,"Scalable infrastructureMany banks assume that putting in place and maintaining a new infrastructure is easy and they can do it on their own; but in many cases, this simply isn’t true. The devil is in the details, and the banks will need an API management tool to fully integrate into the financial services ecosystem. This is not as simple as it might seem at first glance: you can’t just take a ready-made API management solution and hope it will work.Technology plays a key role in realizing the opportunities for business expansion brought about by the new payment world. This entails an architecture that is capable of addressing basic compliance as well as scaling to support various other technology requirements for driving digital business.Moving forward securelyIt goes without saying that an API management tool is central to any Open Banking architecture, as it provides the exposure to customer accounts and payment data through APIs in a secure manner. This comprises things such as strong customer authentication to make sure the security between the API interactions of banks and third-party providers are never compromised.In addition to authentication, customer consent management is also of utmost importance. Service providers must obtain a customer’s explicit consent to complete a transaction on their behalf. This applies particularly when the payment initiation happens through a third party instead of the customer’s bank.Personalized servicesFrom the bank’s perspective, it’s crucial to implement API analytics to identify consumption patterns, as this can drive insight for more API monetization opportunities. The data regarding spending patterns and purchase decisions helps create customized financial products and services that cater for niche market needs and aren’t addressed by competition, supporting strategies for both cross-selling and upselling. On top of this, the banks also need to stay alert and wary of updates in API standardization regarding security, operations and regulations standards.For TPPs, the technology used for compliance purposes should be extended to meet the requirements of third-party services, such as API integration, fraud detection and business analytics integration. Fraud detection and prevention are critical, even more so when operating in an ecosystem of multiple users, as this increases the system’s vulnerability. The fraud prevention solution needs to scale to capture a growing volume of events as well as adopt more stringent methods to detect anomalies in payments. Analytics, in turn, play a general role in development, as the data is only useful when it is analyzed. The data collected from APIs should be processed and presented in a way that’s customized for purpose and audience.Thus, the implemented API solution needs to branch out of a bank’s internal architecture in order to connect to external APIs and online interfaces of the financial organization. As these interfaces might be in various formats, there will be a need for an API aggregator to mediate these formats into a common flow.Standarization of APIWith regards to PSD2, there are several industry-led initiative groups working on API standardization. There has also been an API evaluation group set up by the European Payment Council, with the objective to evaluate standardized API specifications and make recommendations aiming to align these specifications on a European level to help establish harmonized market practices. As most vendors and financial institutions are part of at least one of the initiatives, it’s expected that local regulators will adapt these standards.Creating unified systems means we’re building a foundation for decades to come. As the market realized the risk of fragmentation, the players came together; and this shared premise helps in the face of new challenges as well as in embracing new opportunities. In the coming years, self-sufficient solutions with a mix of Artificial Intelligence will appear, enabling real-time decision-making and the ability to work with customers’ bank accounts and other financial instruments. When the changes require new laws and regulations, the foundation will be a great base to build on.Read the previous blogs on PSD2 and innovation and EU leading the way in open banking. To learn more about how Tieto can help you with business development, please contact me  to set up an appointment.", Edgars Bremze  ,Digitalization , 20.7.2018
The EU takes the lead in Open Banking,/en/blog/2018/07/the-eu-takes-the-lead-in-open-banking/,Digitalization / Edgars Bremze  / 13.7.2018,"A wave of open bankingCountries like China, India and Russia keep a keen eye on the Europeans, as they consider applying laws and regulations similar to PSD2. However, in comparison to the EU, the services available in these markets are already way ahead. They have previously integrated everyday payments into social networks and online banks, providing the possibility to transfer money from an account, card, or phone number. Large providers have become, in essence, payment aggregators, and their platforms are integrated into governmental and municipal services. They enable opening an account and applying for a loan or a mortgage without visiting a single bank, simply online or on a mobile app.Most European banks don’t provide their customers with services that could match what’s available in, for example, China – and we’re not even talking about the simplest of scenarios, like payment services interacting with those of the state. Nonetheless, other countries can’t just sit back and watch what the EU is up to. Although they have developed a channel of digital networks and, quite possibly, the best customer experience, the market is mostly owned by a small number of dominating banks and processors.The EU, in turn, is a club of 28 (still including the UK) countries with individual markets, mentalities and cultures, all of which impact their payment landscape. Thus, PSD2 is not reinventing a single payments industry; all EU members need to choose their take on general concepts, such as Open Banking and instant payments. Hence this is a great opportunity for learning, as some new models and approaches evidently function better than others, with the Swedish mobile payment system Swish as an example.Nordic region takes the leadCurrently, the obvious leaders in the digitization of payments and financial services are the Nordics. This is due to a culture of innovation and positive perceptions of new technologies. Now, the EU is further boosting this mindset by creating rules for the game, and letting the players come.This approach won’t work everywhere. In a lot of other regions, the market can be small, it can be heavily reliant on cash, or people might just prefer the market players that are simply aiming for minimum mandatory compliance with no or very little active innovation. In such countries, no formal regulatory push will help the introduction of new products and services – it must come from the market itself. This is why the results of each individual country should be studied in order to form best practices for others to follow.Collaboration is keyNow is the right time to consider a general re-engineering and optimization of the entire payments market based on standardized rules and APIs. This can only be completed through industry collaboration; otherwise, banks will do what is convenient to them. As current financial institutions are the ones that will provide the APIs, we need to avoid a situation in which the API systems are controlled only by big banks. The EU is attempting to create unified rules and information registers to ensure a level playing field for everyone.Other countries have time to learn from the introduction of open APIs in the EU and consider all positive and negative aspects. The EU might make a mistake or two in the initial production phase; the rest of the world can avoid them by drawing their own conclusions from European experiences.If you would like to learn more about PSD2 and innovation, take a look at the previous blog. To learn more about how Tieto can help you with business development, please contact me  to set up an appointment.", Edgars Bremze  ,Digitalization , 13.7.2018
PSD2 paves the way to innovative banking,/en/blog/2018/07/psd2-paves-the-way-to-innovative-banking/,Digitalization / Edgars Bremze  / 12.7.2018,"The opportunityThe directive was created to regulate payment services and payment service providers within the EU and the European Economic Area, aiming to boost competition and let fintech companies and other non-banks enter the payments industry. By doing so, the regulators expect to reduce costs, encourage innovation and improve consumer protection by standardizing the rights and obligations for payment providers and users across the region.Although PSD2 has been out and about for a while now, unfortunately not much has happened in terms of end-user products and services. This doesn’t mean they aren’t in the making; most likely, new fintech companies as well as established banks and retailers are still looking for the killer business case, innovating and testing out new ideas. They are simultaneously trying to predict what their competitors are up to and how their clients’ behavior is set to change as the new rules and services come into play.What's happening in the market?While we’re still waiting for a flow of innovative products and services, we can definitely see some large players willing to experiment and a few countries, like Finland, rapidly adopting new concepts and ideas. It seems obvious that the first interesting things will occur in countries that have adopted instant payments, because such infrastructure complements and supports most of the theoretical use cases enabled by PSD2.The rest of the market has adopted a ‘wait-and-see’ approach, currently focusing on solving the technical and legal challenges to correctly implement PSD2-compliant infrastructure. Thus, from a banking perspective, we can see segmentation taking place. Some banks are quick adapters with their own Open Banking platforms in place and actively promoting their offering through e.g. events like fintech hackathons; some have even created their dedicated brand specialist banks or branches for only Open Banking purposes. Others, in turn, strictly follow the regulatory agenda, adopting their solutions according to the legally defined timelines.The regulators are also actively participating in the development of the market. The EU Commission and the European Banking Authority work to support the field in the areas of API standardization, regulatory sandboxes as well as regulation in regard to electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation), not to mention the integration of PSD2 and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). One of the signals of this is the approval of the Regulatory Technical Standards for strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication.Thinking of consumersIn all these changes, the customer is at the core. At first, GDPR and PSD2 might sound like inexplicable acronyms that have nothing to do with an individual consumer’s day-to-day life. Nonetheless, Open Banking can make financial services significantly easier and more efficient to manage, increasing their appeal in the eyes of end users. This also brings about a vast variety of business opportunities for all players in the field, including traditional banks with extensive customer bases and new fintech companies aiming to target the smallest of niches – just by serving them better than anyone else.In a series of three blog posts, Tieto is diving into the world of Open Banking from different angles.

The need for collaboration: Public and Private organizations major challenge,/en/blog/2018/07/the-need-for-collaboration-public-and-private-organizations-major-challenge/,Digitalization / Peter Österdahl / 11.7.2018,"My initial idea for this blogpost was to have a complete overview of all public organizations. Let’s just say I gave up that idea pretty quickly. There are so many of them, so to not spend too much time doing research for the correct number of organizations, it is easier to focus on the 1,050. These are the municipalities and counties where you and I live along with more than 20 million people. It's where our loved ones live. These are also the homes of more than 3 million small, medium and large businesses. It is where all of your loved ones work, have worked, or want to work.We rely on one another, the private and public sector that is.  No business = no taxes, no taxes = no welfare. We are cooperating in so many areas, we are building roads, providing daycare, running hospitals and more, everything in private-public cooperation. And overall, we are quite successful doing so.But there is one area where there is almost no collaboration. The collaboration around Cyber Security. In my previous job,  I came to realize that the security industry and its engineers exchanged newly discovered malware. It went both ways and it still does. Some vendor discovered a new Advanced Malware, which they immediately shared with their industry peers, the result: Better protection for all.So let's face it. Cyber security is something that we need to work on together. We have to realize that we can't do it all by ourselves. Just look at trying to recruit skilled security professionals these days. If you find the right one, well, then you need another ten to be able to manage a service 24/7 to protect against threats. Think about the public sector organizations far north in the Nordics. They might find one homecomer, but then there is the additional nine missing. For a Managed Security Provider, MSP, such as Tieto it might be a bit easier, but the cyber security professionals are hunted like reindeer these days.In order to face current and future security challenges we need to solve this gap between private and public sector. So, how do we do that? Well, we all need a space to exchange ideas, share best practices which allows transparency. We can all learn from one another, public from private organisations and vice versa. Creating a smarter society - which implies embedded overall security - is something we need to do together.

"“Hi, I forgot my password” – 6 ways to improve help desk cyber security",/en/blog/2018/07/6-ways-to-improve-help-desk-cyber-security/,Digitalization / Timo Ahomäki / 4.7.2018,"Soon, it’s summer holiday, and your brain gets a long-awaited opportunity to finally erase some cognitive overload. After a few weeks, you return to your desk. Oh gosh, I forgot my password! Better call the help desk to restore it. But what if a cyber crook poses as you, steals your credentials and intrudes systems as you?By nature, help desks are supposed to be helpful. Unfortunately, cyber criminals utilize this to their benefit.Just think of a help desk employee who receives a constant flow of calls, emails and tickets from wide geographies and at odd hours. Closing open requests is the primary KPI of work performance. Under such circumstances, falling into a clever social engineering trap is not a far-fetched risk.How can we mitigate help desk related risks, or at least limit them significantly? Let’s focus on one issue only to make the discussion crystal clear: password resetting through an anonymous help desk.What do I mean by “anonymous” help desks? This: when a help desk receives a call, it does not know who is calling. Vice versa, the caller doesn’t know the person at the help desk.How should the help desk authenticate users?The problem here is obvious: impersonating someone is easy. How to authenticate the user calling to request a password reset? Well, of course, the help desk always asks a few questions to identify the caller somehow. But the information asked is often easy to source by an imposter. Password reset questions are often more useful for a password bypass than to authenticate a user reliably.Probably, most help desks have security policies that should be enforced to verify users. But policies may be too weak, or help desk employees may be tempted to skip them to meet KPIs.What options do we have to improve cyber security?1. Training help desk employeesConstant training of help desk employees is essential to recognize social engineering attacks. Keep the staffers alert of new tricks by courses, role playing, workshops, gamification and occasional penetration testing. However, training needs to be supplemented by other actions.2. SMS or automated phone callsVerification of callers may be done by SMS or automated phone calls. But there’s a weakness here, too: it is possible for a highly motivated attacker to obtain access to someone’s SMS traffic. If that happens, the solution fails.3. Call handling technologyIt is a must in all help desks to utilize call handling and monitoring technology that displays all phone numbers. One powerful solution to authenticate users can be voice recognition technology combined with call recording. By user consent, each user’s voice can be pre-recorded, and automatically compared during a call to verify the user. Voice recognition is prone to spoofing, though.4. A trusted introducerA rare solution is to establish a trusted introducer policy for the help desk. Authentication requires a second person to also get in touch with the help desk to confirm the identity of the user with a password reset request. Each user could present a shortlist of introducers, and upon a request, the help desk would contact them automatically in a preset order. Only after someone responds, the request process begins. The weakness: the second person’s identity can be compromised, too.5. No password resetting over the phoneA very useful solution is to completely deny the possibility to request password resets over the phone. There are ways to perform a password reset from a Windows login screen through the IAM system. This is offered by Tieto, and is becoming an accepted practice, first and foremost due to reasons of security and user experience.6. Multifactor digitalized tools to validate usersIn the market, there are fully digitalized tools available to validate the user by multifactor authentication, to verify user accounts, to manage user identities, to send codes to mobile phones, and to utilize additional identity service layers for high security accounts. Specific attention needs to be paid to the second factor’s security in two-factor authentication.Whatever risk mitigation you choose, you need balancing to avoid weaknesses and to avoid making the solution too hard to use. There’s no simple and straightforward solution to offer, but it may be smart to combine soft and hard methods. Monitoring help desk operations security policies and their implementation is essential.We must consider help desks as a critical front line of cyber security. They are our first point of contact to fix IT-related issues. Unfortunately, they are also the first target for social engineering criminals.At Tieto, we offer our customers secure help desk operations as a service as well as consultancy to improve help desk security.

Cyber Security: A must for municipalities - but how to succeed?,/en/blog/2018/07/cyber-security-a-must-for-municipalities---but-how-to-succeed/,Digitalization / Maria Nordgren / 3.7.2018,"However, the work does not end there. It’s now necessary to work systematically with security to ensure that personal data is protected properly. This applies in particular to municipalities and other public sector parties, where NIS opens up opportunities to utilize the new law and build something positive that increases the citizens' confidence in the authorities through smarter services and more transparency. But this requires that there is a clear plan to make cyber security a guiding principle for the entire organization. Here are some tips on this.For a long time, cyber security was something that municipalities invested in when there was money left in the budget. Today, however, it’s something that has to encompass all operations. One thing to keep in mind is that the human factor is as important as the technical side in terms of cyber threats.Taking into account the human factorResearch shows that in almost half of all cases where data from municipalities have experienced a data breach, it has been the result of an activity caused by an employee, not a sophisticated attack by a hacker. For example, an email sent to the wrong address, or a document stored on a computer where others can access it.Therefore, it’s important that all organizations have a clear policy on how data is handled by employees, and which employees should have access to data in different systems. You have to educate people on common mistakes and regularly update them which procedures should be used when it comes to printing materials,  making backups of important information and installing security applications on one's mobile phone for example.Another important step is to introduce role-based rights to systems and databases. Only those employees who really need access to certain information should have the opportunity to do so. In many municipalities, there may be employees who have worked in the organization for 15-20 years in a variety of roles, and over time gained access to a variety of systems they no longer need. The more users who can log in to a database, the greater the risk that someone's username and password is stolen.The biggest challenge is weak passwords. Even today, many use the same password at work as they do in private accounts in eg. Facebook or private email. Millions of such combinations are targets of attack. The problem of multiple passwords is a familiar one; there are many different passwords to keep track of. Luckily, the solution is simple: a password manager.Update and encryptData security also involves having a secure network and good infrastructure. But even if you spend millions on IT security, no system is ever completely protected against hackers and phishing attacks.The easiest way to get into a system is to find vulnerabilities, and sometimes these may lurk in unexpected places. It is important to constantly keep all software up to date, even when it comes to software seen as unimportant. For example, many municipalities have Wordpress blogs on their websites, but there are countless weaknesses in older versions that a hacker can attack. Updating is the key here; always keep your applications updated.With more technical solutions, one of the most important things is to provide controls that quickly detect suspicious activity. One way is to use SIEM (Security Incident and Event Management), services that constantly monitor the activities of a system and can alert if it detects suspicious logins, or if it appears that data has been compromised. Such solutions are able to see if eg. a username that usually only logs in to a database once a month suddenly starts downloading personal data for thousands of people at once.Organizations must analyze which is the most sensitive data they handle; with municipalities, it is usually personal data. Sensitive data needs to be encrypted every time it is sent by email or stored on a USB stick. This way, it is not that dangerous if someone unauthorized gets access.Increasing trust using GDPRNew security related legislation, such as GDPR, are primarily seen as problems and hindrances. The key to working effectively with them is to see what opportunities they provide for creating better services. For municipalities, they provide a chance to build greater trust among citizens through more transparency. Tieto recently conducted a survey together with Sifo, which showed that many Swedes find it impossible to find out what information the authorities have about them. This is especially important; due to the Transportstyrelsen problem, citizens have less trust that authorities can protect sensitive information.The key thing is that citizens trust authorities; in the cyberage, this is especially important. This requires that there is a plan in place, with dedicated resources - and that everyone is onboard. It's only when every employee is involved in the process of security that one can really succeed.Meet me or one of my colleagues at Almedalen.

GDPR is an opportunity to bolster cyber security,/en/blog/2018/06/gdpr-is-an-opportunity-to-bolster-cyber-security/,Data / Yulia Filipovich / 21.6.2018,"Cyber security refers to a set of techniques used to protect the integrity of networks, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorised access.If companies suffer a cyberattack, they stand to lose assets, reputation and business, and potentially face regulatory fines and litigation – as well as the costs of remediation.Responding to cyber threatsWhile larger organisations tend to have a realistic appreciation of the cyber threats they face, many small to medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable and still largely ignorant of the risks.With GDPR, it is imperative for those enterprises to follow regulations by re-examining their cyber security strategies, which will have a beneficial impact.Most businesses have very extensive business continuity plans. But only about one-third of companies have an incident plan to respond to a major cyberattack. By implementing a risk assessment process, businesses can be more focused on how they respond to cyberattacks, as well as preventing them.Creating a solid cyber security foundationThe most effective strategy to mitigate and minimise the effects of a cyberattack is to build a solid foundation upon which to grow your cyber security technology stack.Formulating an on-going effort to review information handling procedures and identifying technology gaps with a follow-up plan to reduce the risks will help businesses build a strong foundation for assessing the risk of data systems and securing the sensitive information they hold.Where to startTieto Compliance Cloud, as a cloud-based service provider, has a wealth of experience in the cyber security and risk management field. As part of our work with organisations in the financial sector, we have been carrying out cyber security projects for more than four years.A key part of these projects has been the implementation of internal procedures and practices to protect personal data and provide ‘sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures’ in such a way that processing will meet the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).Our Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), for example, is designed using compliant security and privacy controls, demonstrated through certifications and reports, including the ISO27001 certification and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance reports.Consultancies provided by our qualified Compliance Partners are particularly useful for organisations taking their first steps towards complying with GDPR as well as PCI DSS, ISO27001, FFFS and others.Any questions, comments? Get in touch with me!Further readings on the topics of cybersecurity and compliance:Sweden – Trailblazer in cyber security?Proactive, not reactive – gaining competitive advantage by making personal data regulations work for youMore on Tieto offering:Tieto compliance cloudTieto security servicesAuthor: Yulia Filipovich", Yulia Filipovich ,Data , 21.6.2018

It is difficult to imagine but try to visualise having a conversation on the stand about the latest in real-time payments whilst an acrobat and unicyclist are performing just in front of you!This year I noticed the banks were keen to stress how far they have come in their journeys and a good example was set by Ralph Hamers, CEO ING Group who spoke about his ambition to become the go to global platform for all financial needs, which in turn builds upon his 'Think Forward' strategy designed to empower staff to enable this digital vision.Looking back there were many more examples of this new brand of ambitious leadership as banks and PSPs realise that now is the time to adopt a more integrated approach with the emergence of topics such as big data, AI and those traditional players seeing this as an opportunity to create a breed of new value-added services as a by-product of the Open Banking era.Of course, aside from all the serious stuff this is an event which sets out to inform and entertain in equal measure and the organisers have certainly delivered against both objectives in 2018. I enjoyed the full experience of my time in Amsterdam and have come back thinking about Tieto's position in the new payments eco system and also what hot topics might be prominent on the agenda next year.Thinking ahead... to 2019This year will be a tough act to follow but I feel in 2019 there will be more focus on the actual results of the different collaborations between the tech platforms and banks. They need to start delivering through joined-up propositions which will really show benefit to the end consumer. We should also watch out for the continued growth of those quietly growing payment giants moving across from Asia. Ant Financial (Alipay) and WeChat, will expand their models and start to disrupt and drive their businesses in Europe - having a direct impact on the existing service providers.On that note I expect to hear about more consolidation in the market as payment organisations try to align themselves with the right strategic partners and initiatives such as Blockchain deliver against their initial promise to revolutionise traditional areas of Financial Services such as lending and trade finance.With all this to look forward it means our industry continues to be one of the most challenging and exciting places to work... long may this continue.More about Tieto Financial Services", Steve Warner ,Data , 19.6.2018
Risk management in legal cyber-security,/en/blog/2018/07/risk-management-in-legal-cyber-security/,Digitalization / Maria Nordgren / 11.6.2018,"Finland has faced its third largest data breach in last April when the Finnish Enterprise Agencies (Helsingin Uusyrityskeskus) was hacked. Sweden has tackled with an embarrassing leak in 2015 when the Transport Agency acted negligently in outsourcing its cyber capacity. The major incident, however, emerged two years later in 2017.Today, Europe is determined to set herself in a new age of cyber-accountability: nations across the Union have welcomed the very first cyber-security legislation Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive in 2016 and became applicable in May 2018. With this new instrument, a high common level of security of network and information systems is aimed to be achieved within the EU. Member states are going to establish their own “Computer Security Incident Response” (CSIRT) teams.How does it affect the industry players?The law addresses two groups of industries: essential services in critical sectors and digital service providers. Sweden, alongside its fellow member EU states, is going to publish a list of “Operators in Essential Services” active in the following sectors: energy, transport, healthcare, banking, financial market infrastructure, digital infrastructure and drinking water supply and distribution. We expect the list to be published in early November 2018. Government agencies, municipalities, county councils, state and municipal-owned companies and individual companies are all going to be within the regulatory purview of the new law.In Sweden, the Myndigheten för samhällsskydd och beredskap has the responsibility for the coordination of the work regarding this law. We are going to see the new Swedish law “Informationssäkerhet för samhällsviktiga och digitala tjänster”on August 1st, 2018. The law is going to require three major categories of action from the industry actors:incident responsiveness,
breach notification, and
taking the right security measures.Fines … again?It’s not so long ago that we heard how heavy the fines are going to be under the GDPR. Under this new law, too, there will be fines. Failure to comply with this new law is going to yield a penalty up to 10 million SEK. What is more, the breach data received by operators may be distributed to other EU member states through threat intelligence sharing channels. That alone could have implications as hard-hitting as the penalties.What happens if a non-compliance with this new law cuts across the GDPR liabilities?A security non-compliance under this new law may also mean a personal data breach under the GDPR. While not set in stone, it is expected that the higher of the penalties are going to apply as between the GDPR and the NIS.NIS-TransformationMajority of the companies in Sweden are not prepared for this new set of cyber-security obligations. Public administrations are going to be affected the most as well as their suppliers in the essential services industries. A poorly-managed vulnerability may not only mean heavy fines but also a bad record throughout Europe. A gap assessment followed by the necessary transformations are meant to serve the industry players in all the essential sectors to ensure seamless business continuity, unharmed budget and spotless reputation.For more information on how Tieto could do that, please contact:Maria Nordgren +358 (40) 5009760-----------------------------Cagla Salmensuu, Consultant, Security Services +358 (44) 0221983Dario De Vivo, Consultant, Security Services +46 (070) 2835563", Maria Nordgren ,Digitalization , 11.6.2018
Digital competences help to build more equal societies,/en/blog/2018/05/digital-competences-help-to-build-more-equal-societies/,Sustainability / Kia Haring / 28.5.2018,"People arriving from abroad to Finland have their bags full of experience, skills, and knowledge. This applies to those coming from conflict areas or escaping persecution. The Startup Refugeesnetwork is mapping the background of asylum seekers and refugees as well as their skill levels and required support. In the course of two and half years, over 2 000 profiles have been created, and job opportunities are always matched with those who can most benefit from them.Almost all immigrants need some level of assistance to find employment, be it obtaining a hygiene passport or contacts in their field of expertise in the new country of residence. Digital capabilities are also of increasing importance in pretty much any profession, and the lack of them might hinder the chances for many newcomers.The problem is global: in the world, 3,2 billion people have access to the internet, but 4,3 billion don’t. Many international organizations have recently taken a firm stance to boost digital equality. For example, Google has promised to teach 10 million Africans online skills, and Berlin-based NGO Kiron offers web-based higher education for refugees all over the world. The city of New York has set up thousands of Wi-Fi kiosks to let everyone surf the web regardless of their income level. All this implies how the access to the internet has become almost a fundamental need, which should be ensured to everyone just like clean water, protection and primary education.The digital gap between refugees and the rest of the society is still wider and more complex than just a Wi-Fi password, be it in Finland or elsewhere in the world. In addition to accessibility, it’s about how and what for digital skills are used. What’s needed is not only a basic level of skills, but also the ability to notice the opportunities brought about by digitalization to make sure everyone can take advantage of it.Although many asylum seekers can use mobile internet and social media, for many some task are difficult to execute, for example, job seeking independently. There’s a big need to teach practical skills, such as how to look for information, open an email account, use maps or translation applications, or fill out job application forms. We take most of these things for granted, but we shouldn’t forget this isn’t the case with everyone – and these skills have a significant impact on the everyday life as well as the future of an individual in a new country.To meet this demand, Tieto and Startup Refugees have embarked on a joint journey. In honor of Tieto’s half-a-century, the two organizations will provide over 100 asylum seekers and refugees with digital skills. Tieto’s employees will also be able utilize their expertise to help to battle the challenge.Closing the digital divide will help us build bridges, which will be beneficial not only on an individual, but also on a societal level.

The cybersecurity stream is a tributary to the digitalization stream – without cybersecurity, the digitalization stream will dry up.This stream of ours, the cybersecurity market in Sweden, is a big one: 8.8 billion Swedish krona (900 million Euros) in 2017. And there are plenty of us working this stream, ranging from global players to local niche players.What it seems like, though, is that many of those working the 8.8 billion stream are doing it in conventional ways: responding to the technology oriented customer requests and specifications. Inherently there is nothing wrong with this, giving the customers what they want.But is it what they need?In Sweden, it seems that the main cybersecurity streams are: continuous enhancing of in-house capabilities; and looking at cybersecurity from a technological point of view only. While these are approaches that have worked quite well in the past, the sheer vastness of digitalization is rapidly making them obsolete.Who has the resources to continuously maintain, not to speak improve, in-house capabilities in the rapidly changing cybersecurity environment?Adding on top of this the shortening life span of technological cybersecurity products. And, also importantly: is such an organization a place where top cybersecurity experts will want to work?A lot of Swedish companies, small and large, still want to do things on their own, building up Security Operations Centers or Incident Response Teams. Basically a sound idea, but in a rapidly changing and digitalizing world, this is often a heavy and costly approach.Luckily, one does not have to go it alone in cybersecurity; there are numerous possibilities to build up a cybersecurity whole which is the best for a particular organization’s needs.Harking back to the digitalization stream, the way to feed this stream further is to take a strategic approach to cybersecurity. For a lot of organizations with a multi-vendor security strategy, the main pain points are visibility and a clear overview of their security status.This needs to be addressed in ways suitable to the digitalizing environment and economy.

Building a digital Europe: Seamless access to data and the role of blockchain technology,/en/blog/2018/05/building-a-digital-europe-seamless-access-to-data-and-the-role-of-blockchain-technology/,Data / Markus Hautala / 7.5.2018,"Any thriving economy depends on the availability and free movement of skilled labour, products and services. Data has for centuries been an integral element in facilitating the movement of these assets. For the casual observer, it might seem that – thanks to the internet, API economy, cloud services and data platforms – we have largely managed to solve the issue of free movement of data. But as the EU Commission initiative, “Building a European Data Economy” illustrates, this is not the case. There are still major barriers to free movement of data and competition, due to localisation restrictions and lack of rules for data portability.The European Commission has sought to remove these barriers by issuing regulations such as GDPR and the recent proposal for a regulation on a framework for the for the free flow of non-personal data. Whilst these initiatives are major steps in addressing the issue of data portability, they fail to tackle one of the biggest challenges prevalent in the modern internet: the verifiability of data.Trusted interactions require verifiable dataAs anyone who has ever bought anything online knows, the main issue with data is not its availability, but instant access to trusted data. Can I trust the merchant to deliver the purchased goods? Can I trust that the goods are not counterfeited? These are just some of the concerns for consumers and e-commerce is but one of many use cases. The W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group has identified many more in domains such as finance, education and healthcare. As more and more of our personal and business activities move to the internet, we need to make various kinds of claims as part of our everyday activities in transactional interactions. For example, we use a driver’s license to prove that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, a university degree to prove our education status and government-issued passports to grant us travel between countries.From centralised platforms to a distributed trustAs the amount of digital data has exploded, new platform-based business models have emerged. Due to network effects, this has led to a situation where a relatively small number of platforms control our data, as well as continue to grow and gain more influence. European Union initiatives related to data portability aim to address some of these concerns. Yet whilst doing so, the European Commission takes the former network, infrastructure and trust models as given. The trust and data sharing paradigms present in platform-based business models rely on the existence oftrusted counterparty (”the platform”). As instant access to trusted information is becoming increasingly vital for our everyday interactions, a new type of approach for exchanging the data is needed. During the past couple of years, a new network and trust model based on distributed infrastructure – namely blockchain – has emerged. One of the reasons why blockchain technology has received significant interest is that it has the potential to transform existing trust models – including how personal data can be handled. Instead of relying on centralised trust platforms, we now have the means to establish new types of trust infrastructures without vendor lock-in.Decentralised identity helps guard personal data whilst improving customer insightUntil recently, the prevalent way to share identity information has been through a centralised platform with a single point of control. The problem with trusted middlemen is that when compromised, they pose a massive security risk to a large number of people.As global digitalisation moves forward, we have witnessed a tremendousincrease in hacks and personal data breaches that cripple businesses. Recent examples include the Equifax breach, where more than 145 million people were exposed to identity theft and the Facebook leak in which more than 50 million user profiles were handed to Cambridge Analytica.Handling customer data is clearly a huge risk for organisations, but at the same time, it is the cornerstone of customer relationships and business critical operations. How can organisations then maintain a holistic view of their customers without exposing themselves to increasing risks and regulatory pressures? This is actually one of the goals of GDPR: to make organisations rethink how to handle customer information. And this is exactly what solutions decentralised identity networks, such as Sovrin, allows them to do.Decentralised identity networks can deliver the internet’s missing trust layerIn decentralised identity networks, the identity holder forms secure digital connections with entities (organisations, individuals or things) that can provide information about the identity holder. This information can literally be anything such as a name, government ID, address, power of attorney, drivers licence, health information, university degree etc. This verifiable data can then be shared by the identity holder to a party that requires these proofs. This provides for all kinds of rich digital interactions: Know-Your-Customer, contract and transaction signing (B2B, B2C, G2C), permits, insurance claim, job application and so on. Storing identity data on blockchain would naturally be problematic for various reasons, including adherence to GDPR compliance and risk of data hacks. In a decentralised identity network, actual identity data is not stored on the ledger. Instead of identity data, the decentralised ledger only contains pointers to the data. These uncorrelatable pieces of information are related to an identity holder and stored on the ledger to allow entities access, share and verify identity data when authorised.What should the European public sector do?Whether we realise it or not, technology choices always also carry choices of ideology. This is rarely as evident as in the context of identity data. By supporting centralised platforms, we are essentially supporting a business model which leads to a situation where a relatively small number of operators remain in control of our data and – due to network effects – continue to gain even greater influence over our lives.The European public sector holds the keys to changing the course of this path. In the context of verifiable data, public administration maintains base registries such as citizen, company, land, vehicle and others. Due to the trust held in public authorities, these are the most reliable sources of basic information. Seamless access to this data is essential in digitalising not only the government but in all interactions (B2B, B2C, G2C). To drive the adoption of distributed identity networks, private and public sector participants should jointly and iteratively prototype, pilot and develop new distributed infrastructure concepts to demonstrate their value for citizens.ConclusionCompetitive economies depend on the availability and free movement of labour, products and services – and data is the fuel that drives the movement of these assets. Despite the ubiquity of the internet and related technologies, barriers remain in access to verifiable data needed in transactional interactions. EU initiatives related to data portability aim to tackle some of the problems concerning access to data and the dominance of data platforms. These initiatives, however, fall short in responding to issues related to instant access to data needed in transactional interactions. The cause for this is that these initiatives do not address trust, data sharing and infrastructure issues caused by platform-based business models.During the past couple of years, blockchain-based distributed platforms have emerged, providing us means to establish new types of trust infrastructures without vendor lock-in. The public sector has a pivotal role in digitalising society, as it maintains the base registries containing verifiable identity data needed by both public and private sectors in transactional interactions. The public sector needs to actively drive the adoption of the new distributed platforms in collaboration with the private sector to ensure a wide market take-up. It is now time to time to make the EU’s single market fit for the digital age and ensure that the European economy remains globally competitive – bringing benefits to both businesses and consumers.This article is published in the May 2018 edition of Open Access Government", Markus Hautala ,Data , 7.5.2018
Can artificial intelligence run a paper machine better than humans?,/en/blog/2018/04/can-artificial-intelligence-run-a-paper-machine-better-than-humans/,Data / Antti Blomqvist  / 16.4.2018,"A modern paper machine produces vast amounts of data, but operators decide how order fulfilment is done. Little is done to use available data to optimise production costs, forecast important laboratory measurements or entire production line efficiency. Important decisions are made ignoring solid support material.From partly perfect to totally optimisedPaper machine automation is extremely good at driving the most important quality parameters to target while producing the batch in minimum time, but ignores business targets. It is unable to consider the entire production line and the overall production economy end-to-end.We need to balance quality, production costs and runnability while keeping the customer promise. As quality, especially in the board industry, is often customised and increasingly important, automation and business systems need to exchange much more data. Each production run being different, advanced optimisers need much more information of the business situation and used raw materials used to be able to optimise properly. On the other hand, business systems need more data from automation to be able to optimise and control operations throughout the complete production line.The economy of precisionThis is where the enormous volume of data comes into play. Based on data, developed measuring technologies and machine learning, AI-based modelling will adjust the optimisation model and make predictions. It continuously learns from the model and actual data. Tieto’s AI projects in the industry show that tangible improvements are possible after only weeks training an AI.The first concrete step is to provide instruction to machine operators to complete planned customer orders with optimised quality, as cost-efficiently as possible. The next step is to continuously and automatically re-trim production to further optimise order fulfilment and the use of already produced material.Optimisation always starts with measuring and continues with analysing, modelling and forecasting – in this sequence. Modelling is nothing new in the paper industry but modern technology now provides standards for storing and accessing all data, enabling huge cloud-based computing power and bringing modern AI-based technologies into common use. Ecosystems – like Valmet and Tieto – enable deep integration across system boundaries. New doors are now opened.An automatically optimised machine chain will run production more economically and avoid both under- and overproduction. In future, operators can work most of the time in the field supporting the production process and intervene only when decision-making is needed.It’s a long race, but the prize is worth itTrue, the road to fully automated, self-learning production chains is long and somewhat winding. Measurements are already there, what needs to be done is analysing the results and create a model, teach the system for accurate predictions, and only then can you optimise. There are no shortcuts.For many companies, the first step is to collect all data under one, commonly accepted interface. Production systems are rather intolerant to wide-ranging data searches, so data should be copied into a data lake that can hold vast amounts of unstructured data in different formats for further use.Tieto’s industry expertise, integration competencies and process management knowledge help you create a platform on top of which specific solutions can be built to make use of the data in the lake. Tieto has previously designed data lake solutions for hospitals where important new insights for better processes have been achieved.If this sounds like science fiction, it will not in a few years’ time. AI-based solutions are advancing rapidly in all industries, and Tieto has several references of successful implementations.

Sweden – Trailblazer in cyber security?,/en/blog/2018/04/sweden--trailblazer-in-cyber-security/,Data / Peter Österdahl / 10.4.2018,"Sweden has a special touch in many aspects of life, but digital security is a great leveller. Cybercrime knows no frontiers. The fact that many successful businesses originate from Sweden can actually make it a more interesting target for criminals.The list of top security threats in Sweden looks very similar to a list in any other developed country. Crypto currency mining is probably going to be the number 1 threat of 2018 also in this northern kingdom.The protection methods Swedish companies use are not different from other parts of the world: firewalls, proxies, and IPS systems can all be found in Swedish organizations that take security seriously.And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. If the security systems are set up correctly, maintained regularly, and fed with correct information, most attacks can be avoided or their effect mitigated.The Swedish wayIf the threats are the same all around the world, and the protection methods used are similar, is there anything that would make Sweden different from the rest?Well, for one, the Swedes are security-focused people. We even have a government body for societal security – and they also handle information security.This attitude shows itself also in cyber security. The tendency is to favour established security providers and solutions over startups and more progressive approaches.Being cautious has its advantages. For example, some much-hyped NG, or next-generation, security products are just that: hype. On the other hand, we must be able to admit that certain NG solutions offer great technology. However, in addition to state-of-the-art technology we also have to hone processes and make security a daily practice.But if there is one thing that is symptomatically Swedish, it is consensus. Nothing is decided before a common agreement on the best way to proceed has been reached.Sweden has the aim of becoming world leader in digital transformation. There is also a six-point national cyber security strategy. With the national character and tradition for success, Sweden is well positioned to become the next security superstar.Do you want to know more about securing your business?

What will healthcare look like in a smarter society?,/en/blog/2018/02/what-will-healthcare-look-like-in-a-smarter-society/,Data / Matti Ristimäki / 22.2.2018,"Nordic countries could be the forerunners in development of data-driven healthcare services. Finland, Sweden and Norway have been collecting health and social welfare data in digital formats for about 20 to 30 years. Almost all of this data is linked to individuals by their social security number, enabling a connection of multiple-data sources. In theory, that is an excellent base to start with. However, there are some relatively high barriers slowing down the development of data utilisation, with data being scattered in hundreds of different systems and in different formats.Predictive analysis to deliver targeted servicesBy collating all of data into data lakes and having Artificial Intelligence (AI) analyze it, we will be able to make data models for different scenarios. Through the analysis of vast piles of healthcare and social welfare data, we could track patterns that reveal at-risk segments of the population or even predict the illnesses that individuals may be genetically predisposed towards. Doctors will always be needed but, if information (about patients' allergies, case history etc.) is given to the doctors automatically, they can focus more on human interactions and quality of care, and not struggle with computers and information systems.For instance, diabetes is a growing problem in the Nordics. Healthcare authorities could task AI systems with identifying people at risk of contracting this lifestyle disease, and predict what additional resources will be needed to prevent it from developing further. This will also help the government take steps to promote healthier lifestyles among its citizens, leading to less of a drain on resources in the years ahead.Studies and research have shown that even a simple level of predictive analysis will help optimize costs by 10% to 15%. Considering that the Nordic social health costs range around 150 billion euros, annually, that is a huge amount of savings which can be diverted to improve the lives of citizens.A data-driven approach to optimize resourcesThis is why Tieto has launched Tieto Intelligent Wellbeing, a data-driven solution, to help healthcare and welfare organizations utilize their patient data. This will help create innovative solutions and personalize services to a degree never seen before. We are already working with several major healthcare providers and organizations including HUS, one of the biggest hospitals in Europe, in helping analyze their data.Similar advantages exist for the social welfare system. In Oulu city in Finland, studies have been done on citizens using social welfare services. It showed that 64% of healthcare and welfare costs were generated by individuals who are also welfare customers, which means there are clear linkages between both groups. By delivering targeted services to one, it is quite possible to reduce the burden on the other. One way would be for governments to provide at-risk sections of the population with training, resources and additional support to improve their quality of life, which in turn will reduce their need to access healthcare services as frequently.Taking all of this into account, we are confident that the healthcare and social welfare system of tomorrow will deliver a level of care and attention so far unmatched in human history.", Matti Ristimäki ,Data , 22.2.2018
How ready are we for Artificial Intelligence and a smarter society?,/en/blog/2018/02/how-ready-are-we-for-artificial-intelligence-and-a-smarter-society/,Data / Christian Guttmann / 5.2.2018,"We are in a similar place when it comes to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its effect on our lives. There is no denying that we are entering a future where AI will be part and parcel of our daily lives. In fact, we predict, over the next 20 years, AI technology will have the most dominant impact in all areas of life, ranging from simple activities such as buying a movie ticket to potentially more complex tasks such as performing brain surgery.We have already clear indications for these AI transformations to be successfully applied. 'Narrow' AIs are tasked towards specific purposes and are in use in the healthcare, banking and retail space. They already help us with many tedious tasks such as assessing a large number of medical transcripts, studying radiographs, calculating premiums and also personalize our web browsing experience.They also perform services by combing through gigantic amounts of data and calculating data models that help us make decisions more effectively. But even with all of this, on a scale level of 1 to 10, we would wager that we're barely at level 2 when it comes to exploiting AI's full potential.Moving towards Artificial General IntelligenceThe good news is that we are on the right path towards understanding and applying AI. Even as we speak, organizations across different industries are working on ways to integrate AI into their systems and better optimize their businesses. Work has already begun on developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems which can combine the work of several narrow AI systems like Deep Learning, Augmented Data Discovery, Dialogue Engines and Smart Robots, to name a few, and perform a larger range of more complex tasks.In short, an AGI is able to orchestrate the performance of several complex tasks at the same time. It will drive your car, monitor your health and bank balances and interact with you using a digital persona. As we are already using Siri and Cortana, we can easily project that the development of more advanced AIs is inevitable.Things will get more interesting when you marry advanced AIs with drones and other smart robots. A multi-agent, distributed system as we call it. We could even have multiple AIs collaborating with one another in the form of artificial teams. We already know that humans can work more efficiently alongside AI. In the future, we will have even more Human/AI teams, supplemented by smart robots or drones, and increase the success rates in performing complex tasks.As we continue to move into the age of AI, a big question that needs to be asked is how ready is the world to embrace AI. Even now, AI is considered the preserve of tech companies and most attempts to take it mainstream have had to deal with basic constraints like a lack of infrastructure to effectively deploy it. This is why it is necessary for governments to prioritize AI development across sectors and create strong AI infrastructure.Need for a strong AI policyMany governments acknowledge the transformative impact AI will have on economy, society and well-being. To capitalise effectively on it, they will continue to create a strong AI policy. One that will lay down norms to ensure that AI is deployed responsibly and that AI applications meet international standards. This, in turn, will have a domino effect, encouraging business and citizens to engage with AI more confidently.Governments and international organizations will put more thought into the kind of regulations that govern AI and its usage. The AI systems of the future will be self-learning machines that may have a unique take on the world. We must ensure that any regulations that govern AI are designed to further many criteria, with one such criterion being its effectiveness. However, arbitrary limitations will only turn AI into a good-looking program instead of a system which has a huge potential to effect change.Last but not the least, we must also look into ethical concerns. Who will be responsible for an AI's actions? How do we help it decide what kind of actions must be taken? How do we help AI to understand our values, and also the ability to balance risk versus benefit? These are questions that bring together different schools of thought like philosophy and morality. Organizations are currently engaged in helping make these kind of decisions, but we must accelerate this process if we can.We, at Tieto, have taken the lead and are actively engaging with governments to help them figure out a strong AI policy. For this to succeed, it requires the active involvement of all stakeholders. After all, we would all benefit from shaping a smarter society, one that is resilient and helps us improve our lives dramatically.Watch Christian Guttmann's video, ""Are we ready for Artificial Intelligence and a smarter society?"", here.What does a smarter society mean?The value of the smarter society comes in many flavors. Tieto's ambition is to utilize our expertise to continue shaping a smarter society, one which anticipates the needs of the people in every phase of their lives.

Four tips for successful DevOps implementation — how to avoid typical misconceptions,/en/blog/2018/01/four-tips-for-successful-devops-implementation--how-to-avoid-typical-misconceptions/,Cloud / Tapani Tirkkonen / 16.1.2018,"DevOps (Development & Operations) is a unique software development approach for businesses that are looking for shorter time-to-market lead times, lower development costs, improved quality and continuous improvements in products and services for customers and end-users.The transition into fully utilizing DevOps is a journey that affects many elements inside an organization: processes, technologies, organizational culture, structure and even employee habits. This transformation has both opportunities and potential obstacles. But this should not be discouraging. With the right approach, adopting DevOps is easier than it might seem at first glance.Below I list tips for avoiding typical misconceptions about DevOps implementation.1. Be realistic in your implementation time scheduleMisconception: DevOps implementation is done within a few monthsIt is important that the entire organisation understands that they will soon undergo a vast renovation. This change requires a considerable timescale — likely measured in years, rather than months. Also, be aware, that this is a journey without an end — you should strive for continuous improvement.2. Ensure you have enough human resourcesMisconception: We will succeed because a few people received DevOps trainingThis transformation requires the right scale of dedicated human resources. This is not a task for one person that has undergone training and participated in a series of workshops. As DevOps implementations are highly interdisciplinary, you will need a network of professionals across the organization that can foster collaboration in tight-knit teams.3. You simply can't outsource DevOps implementationMisconception: Skilled external consultants will make the DevOps transformation for usThe DevOps journey will impact your organization as a whole. This means that it cannot be handled from the outside by another organization. The bulk of the work will be done inside your own development teams. However, an external entity is useful for advocating change, guiding your path and helping the process along.4. Look for quick wins with low-hanging fruitsMisconception: DevOps transformation will show benefits only after years of workApproach the transformational challenge the right way to obtain considerable benefits quickly. Based on my experience with clients, Value Stream Mapping has been extremely useful exercise for many organizations. Through this process, we have identified the most challenging areas and the areas in which DevOps will yield the most benefits. This detailed process enables us to identify the needed changes and the required effort to implement them. Thus, we have a clear roadmap, with ""low-hanging fruit"" at the beginning and bigger challenges waiting further along the journey. This path, which is divided into achievable incremental steps, reassures teams by continuously demonstrating that DevOps is the correct way to go. Moreover, the early results help drive the organizational change and speed up the transformation.DevOps results speak for themselves, although it is necessary to note that each DevOps transformation is unique. In one recent Tieto DevOps service delivery, the customer's development efficiency increased by 250%, while infrastructure and operational support costs were lowered by 50% — with further cost reductions visible in licensing and tools.Read more DevOps insights here — Innovate and bring new services and products to market faster with higher quality.Tietoevry DevOps Advisory Services can help you proceed towards real DevOps benefits, whether you are just evaluating DevOps for your organization or have already implemented DevOps practices.", Tapani Tirkkonen ,Cloud , 16.1.2018
We care — do you? Business and ethics simply need to go hand in hand,/en/blog/2018/01/we-care--do-you-business-and-ethics-simply-need-to-go-hand-in-hand/,Cloud / Kia Haring / 9.1.2018,"Our hearts have spoken on the #MeToo movement over the recent months, as it has put sexual harassment and abuse at the centre of the discussion. This phenomenon has also impacted corporate agendas in a new way; today, the necessary standard is zero tolerance for any kind of harassment or discrimination.The need to develop towards more equal, transparent life and business conduct also brings company purpose into the spotlight in a major way. We need to ask ourselves, what kind of values do we cherish? What kind of leadership are we conducting? Which business ethics do we want to pursue? And what do we not tolerate under any circumstances?For businesses, the time to remain on the sidelines is over. I believe businesses need more initiatives that take a stand and make them active players in this broad conversation.Last autumn's discussions have focused on unacceptable behaviour, but also on the language that is used. As a professional communicator, I understand that the way we talk about and present ideas not only reflects our reality but also shapes how that reality is perceived. Therefore, I read with great interest about the initiative of a major Finnish daily to move towards gender neutral language in their journalism. Language can often be value-laden and should therefore be scrutinized.What we believe inAt Tieto, we welcome this discussion and recognize the need for companies to be more active in the discussion on achieving a more equal, diverse and inclusive world. Our Code of Conduct makes it very clear that there is zero tolerance for any form of discrimination or harassment. We instruct employees to escalate any misconduct or suspected violations against our business ethics guidelines, and they have the option of doing so anonymously.With about 14,000 Tieto colleagues around the world — representing different backgrounds, nationalities and cultures — one cannot succeed by trying to control what people do. That is why it is important to have jointly created shared values that are communicated in a clear and easy way for people to identify with and commit to. Diversity is highly needed and valued in our business sector, where diverse problems are solved every day with new innovations based on new technologies. Values and ethics are also a requirement for thriving businesses.Consider how you are going to contributeThe questions of ethics, values, transparency and inclusion do not of course just affect how we co-operate with our colleagues, but how we interact with all our various stakeholders. In other words, how we handle these issues stems from our very principles of business conduct.The global Earned Brand 2017 study from Edelman highlighted that almost 60 percent of consumers make a purchase decision — or even decide to boycott brands — depending on their stance on socially important topics. In terms of customer engagement, it is important how a company places itself in relation to these important issues.It is evident that the #MeToo movement has started some essential progress, but how long will its positive impacts last? Still, one thing is certain: businesses and other organizations need to be more active champions of equality, diversity and inclusion, among other key social topics.At the end of day, we must actively participate and take action to driving this change — with our own employees and the ecosystems of partners, customers and other stakeholders. Now is the time for a #WeToo attitude: #WeToo care, #WeToo want to make a difference and #WeToo demand an end to inequality in all forms.I urge you to take a stand too. How are you going to contribute to this positive change?", Kia Haring ,Cloud , 9.1.2018
Human-centred approach to data leads the way to a smarter digital age,/en/blog/2017/11/human-centred-approach-to-data-leads-the-way-to-a-smarter-digital-age/,Data / Tomi  Oinonen / 17.11.2017,"Human-centred approach to data leads the way to a smarter digital ageTrust in the digital age is broken. Can you remember the last time you got insurance or bought something from a private person from another EU country to yours? Or when was the last time you signed a contract or gave a power of attorney online? The chances are that you rarely have. Although our private and business lives have become increasingly digital, we still seem to lack mechanisms to conduct these common interactions online. The underlying reason, of course, is that the internet was not built with trusted interactions in mind. Online nobody can verify what you say or the information you share is true.As the amount of data generated by people, organisations and devices continue to grow at an exponential pace – the IDC predicts a ten-fold increase in data generated from now to 2025 – it is becoming essential that we have practical means to manage and share our data. The regulators in Europe have also reacted to this need by launching regulatory initiatives such as Payment Services Directive (PSD2), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ePrivacy directive, which share the common ambition of empowering citizens to have access to their data as well as being able to control and share it. Through these initiatives, the EU aims to actively enforce data protection rules and create a fairer platform for data protection, that supports consumers and businesses whilst promoting innovation.Data verifiability remains an issue in digital interactionsGDPR and PSD2 regulations are significant steps to the right direction of providing identity holders access and control over their data. Both focus on enabling data portability, with the goal of enabling new digital business innovations. As such, they will fuel disruption in the digital industry by opening existing data silos by allowing customers to migrate their data to a new service provider. As Erkki Poutiainen, chairman of the EBA Clearing Board mentions, PSD2 together with new technology can revolutionise the payment landscape and even banking as we know it.While gaining access to data is a necessity for opening up competition, more is required. The key issue in data portability is not only that data is shareable, but also that the data retains its verifiability. Just imagine receiving a power of attorney digitally but not being able to prove its validity. Clearly, verifiability is the crucial element that retains the value of data and as such is of critical importance.Digital identities for people and organisations, as well as verifiable data, are the fundamentals needed for digital trust interactions. Portable digital identity and data will enable us to create an equal and inclusive society by allowing anyone to participate in the new economy.MyData and the new decentralised internet hold promise for solving the trust problemRecently, a Nordic model for human-centred personal data management and processing called MyData has raised thoughts about how data could be managed with identity owner at the centre. MyData brings a fundamental change in how we view and use data. It is an ideology, driven by three main principles of:Identity owner centric control and privacy;
Usable data. Data must be technically easy to access in a machine readable open format accessible via standardised interfaces and;
Open business environment. MyData proposes a new identity owner centric approach in exchanging data. In this concept the identity owner has a single hub for data management. Via the hub the identity owner can give services the authority to access and use data.A key prerequisite for all the regulations and models to become truly effective – is that a new infrastructure paradigm for managing identities and sharing verifiable data is needed. Even if every person and organisation has an identity, we still fail to replicate this online. This is mainly due to identities being fragmented over various data silos. MyData and the regulations aim to remove the silos, but this is still not enough, since they don’t provide the infrastructure which would foster true collaboration and competition, that are needed for the market to grow.The rise of decentralised solutions, such as blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies (DLT), have given rise to new types of ecosystems where businesses, public organisations and individuals can form trust relationships without involving middlemen. These decentralised solutions hold also great promise for solving the identity and integrity issues prevalent in sharing and trusting on data.Decentralised identity network can deliver the internet’s missing identity layerOne of the most promising initiatives aiming to solve the challenge of being able to trust information exchanged online is Sovrin. Sovrin is a global, decentralised identity network that delivers the Internet’s missing identity layer. Sovrin allows people and organisations to create portable, digital identities which they control.In Sovrin, the identity holder forms secure digital connections with entities (organisations, individuals or things) that can provide information about the identity holder. This information can literally be anything such as a personal identification number, home address, power of attorney or – in the context of GDPR and PSD2 – customers consent to a service provider. This information can then be shared forward by the identity holder to a party that requires these proofs. This provides for all kinds of rich digital interactions: Know-Your-Customer, contract and transaction signing (B2B, B2C, G2C), permits, asset ownership, and so on.Towards a smarter society created with new technologyBlockchain has rapidly emerged as one of the disrupting technologies of the 21st century. We at Tieto believe that it will be one of the key ingredients of success for our customers’ future business and that it can be harnessed to build more equal, inclusive and smarter societies. With this in mind, Tieto is working on various fronts to open up current data silos for the benefit of Nordic organisations and citizens.Tieto is currently looking into how to utilise blockchain technology within healthcare. Together with California-based company Gem, the company is working on how to link genetic data stored in biobanks, personal health records at hospitals and individual citizens to bring the benefit of panomics to diagnostics and treatment scenarios.
Tieto and Evernym, the leading developer of self-sovereign identity technologies in October 2017 launched a Sovrin Pilot Program, aiming to introduce the Sovrin identity platform to Nordic customers. The helps businesses and public organisations better manage digital interactions, by increasing trust and reducing costs with the help of the distributed identity network. The multi-party initiative aims to rapidly validate and implement commercially viable solutions that leverage this global network.By its design distributed ledger technology introduces a new trust model for ecosystem collaboration. To this end, Tieto is excited to explore new use cases utilising the technology in close collaboration with its customers and partners.It’s your data. Take it back.

Enhanced reality is more real than it might seem,/en/blog/2017/10/enhanced-reality-is-more-real-than-it-might-seem/,Digitalization / Helmut Krämer / 26.10.2017,"The conference provided us with valuable insights to fuel our journey with the Tieto Enhanced Reality Lab to explore the opportunities in the area together with our partners, customers and users.Choosing Munich as location for the event was a logical move - the city is a home to fewworld-class industry players - such as Metaio, a company which has been recently acquired by Apple and is considered the baseline for AR Kit. The conference ran over 2 days, but the program has been extremely packed with various content, including successful use cases, learnings and impact, trends and future forecast. Three simultaneous tracks were running most of the time, as well as a large expo floor with close to 100 exhibitors brought the latest hardware & software innovation to satisfy our curiosity and provide some hands on experience. There have been multiple takes on applying the tech to training and education, medicine, collaboration, entertainment and art.To my positive surprise, the focus of conversation is more and more shifting from pure tech to the impact of immersive interactivity on user experience. New paradigms of storytelling and interaction are being established, and even hardware companies are realising that UX is playing great part in the rate of adapting the innovation by greater audience. The augmented reality promises above all the intuitive interface, and shorter learning curve, yet proven rise in the efficiency of operations. Several of the enablers that were brought to light include Apple AR kit, that is instantly covering an impactful number of devices already out on the market and in consumers hands. Also Google Tango, which makes visual positioning services more easily available.""We have been longing for the breakthrough in hardware, such as light field technology, which is still lacking from most of the products out on the market."" - Helmut Krämer, AR / VR evangelist, Tieto XR LabEven though the technology is not yet mainstream, it is projected to grow and gain wider acceptance. Smart glasses might still be slightly too industrial-looking to be considered fashionable, yet few ongoing projects are aiming to bring them to same look and feel as sunglasses. Or combine the personal HUD with wireless headphones, bringing extended functionality and hands-free interaction capability to familiar devices.Confirming their great success rate of trend predictions Gartner shared the 5 key trends to keep in mind when considering the VR / AR strategy:By 2020, 100M consumers will shop in AR. We have seen some exciting examples such as augmenting experience of trying products on your body, or recognising the object by pointing the app to it and being able to instantly purchase it by-passing stores or physical showrooms.
By 2020, 30% of web browsing sessions will be done without a screen. With the advancement of digital personal assistants, backed by machine learning and natural language processing, the interaction with tech will become more casual and word-based. Chatbots will enter our lives in such ways that we might noteven realise that we are dealing with a non-human.
By 2022, the IoT will save consumers and businesses in the range of USD 1 trillion a year. Considering an industry use case, predictive maintenance is capable of saving 10-20% over preventive measures. The interaction with digital twins in virtual space instead of physical objects will gain more traction. Tieto has already been working on several projects alongside this trend to recognize its power.
By 2021, 20% of all activities in which an individual engages will involve at least one of the top seven digital giants (companies such as Apple, Amazon, Alibaba and Google). The amount of data generated is constantly increasing, and access to this data provides opportunity to deliver more relevant and timely services, which in turn also locks users. On a greater scale, this trend will drive more collaboration with digital giants' platforms and ecosystems.
By 2020, 40% of employees can cut their healthcare costs by wearing a fitness tracker. Wellness trend will drive corporate health monitoring and fitness programs, as it is increasingly being recognised as part of the employee experience. We are already exploring the potential of usinghealth data combined with intelligent environments and virtual / augmented technologies to enhance wellbeing and wellness coaching.As can be expected, AI & ML are gaining more and more importance. Not only AI is being taught inside the virtual environments, for example in case of autonomous cars, but also researchis being conducted on using humans as sensors to teach the AI from the first-person perspective. This combined with smart glasses tech is already producing impressive results in predicting users' needs, recognising sign language and assisting visually impaired to sense the world around them.""Few highlights were the advances in object model tracking (vs. image tracking) and Prezi AR, as refreshing approach to corporate presentations"" - Pasi Muranen, Technical Architect, Tieto XR Lab & DDBWith advancement of hardware, speed of platforms and ecosystems development that we've witnessed it is obvious that the augmented, virtual and mixed reality technology (XR tech) is leaving the realm of being considered ""futuristic"" and enters the state of being accessible, and providing visible business value. In the upcoming years it will be nearly mandatory for companies to create AR / VR strategy to stay competitive in their industry and beyond.Our team is ready to share more insights from the event, and guide you in creating a strategic roadmap when it comes to virtual and augmented experience and technology. Welcome to visit our Lab in Tieto HQ in Keilaniemi Espoo and get the first-hand experience with services and tech gadgets.Join us at Slush for the launch of the Virtual Forest service, created for forest owners by Metsä Group and welcome to Tieto Slush booth to experiece it yourself.", Helmut Krämer ,Digitalization , 26.10.2017
Before and after instant payments,/en/blog/2017/10/before-and-after-instant-payments/,Cloud / Edgars Bremze  / 10.10.2017,"At Tieto, we believe that there's no substitute for knowledge and experience. We'll help you learn from your mistakes. But our experience and proven methodologies also help you short-cut mistakes to learn from ours and other people's. This is relevant to instant payments because participants almost need to know the end before they start the design. Output is a function of input. But clearly without having got to the end of an instant payments project, it's hard to have those learnings you wish you'd known at the start.In this blog I've pulled together some before-and-after-instant-payments advice.Coverage — one of the most critical aspects of an instant payments project is to have maximum participation in the system. Participation from banks and non-banks alike helps to build critical mass and strengthens the network effect for both service providers and end-users. Some central banks go as far as mandating participation in the system to ensure maximum coverage from the outset.Open — build an open-loop system to ensure interoperability between participants and across networks, e.g. bank, card and mobile money rails. We advise adhering to internationally-accepted, open payment standards (e.g. ISO 20022) to deliver cross-border interoperability, too. Open systems are more efficient and cost-effective than closed-loop 'walled gardens'. They avoid duplication of effort by individual participants, which keeps costs down and optimises the services delivered to end-users.Rules and governance — involve those with a vested interest in the success of the system in rule-writing and governance. This further drives participation, buy-in, interoperability and ultimately adoption. It also informs the design of the technical features and processes below.Technical features — with an instant payments system, funds are available to the beneficiary in real-time or as close to real-time as possible. Base the system on irrevocable push payments, which are settled behind-the-scenes between participants at least once a day. This minimises costs, complexity, build time and the risk from failing participants.Up-stream and down-stream processes — the technical features and build are important but also consider supporting processes. Back-end support functions, such as core banking, fraud prevention and sanctions screening, must operate 24/7/365. This is one of the biggest challenges for participants used to a batch system. Also, take the opportunity to build out new front-end applications that utilise real-time functionality, such as mobile and P2P applications.Use cases — look beyond P2P and plan a possible roadmap of products from the outset. These include P2B in both the physical and remote environments, B2B and all types of P2G and B2G use cases. This influences how the system and integrations are designed. It also influences how participants map existing payment products to the new instant infrastructure, bundle and sell them. Plus how they develop new products.Communication — last but certainly not least is communication. Central banks should involve all market participants in the instant payments process. They need to communicate with banks and bank associations, non-bank service providers and the public at large. Buy-in from participants and end-users is so important as it drives usage and behavioural change. Communication is a running theme throughout any instant payments project.How Tieto can helpWe have plenty of relevant instant payments experience. We are currently working with the Kenya Bankers Association, an industry body comprising 45 banks, on building out the first real-time interbank transaction platform in East Africa. This national project supports Kenya's payments strategy to enhance both interoperability through shared technology infrastructure and financial inclusion.Meanwhile in our native Finland, we designed and implemented Siirto, the country's first real-time multi-bank platform for mobile payments. This was PSD2-compliant two years ahead of time and natively built for an open and API-driven age.For more client references or to find out more about how Tieto could help you take advantage of the instant payments opportunity, please contact me Edgars Bremze, senior offering manager at Tieto or see our web page for more.Tags: Financial services", Edgars Bremze  ,Cloud , 10.10.2017
