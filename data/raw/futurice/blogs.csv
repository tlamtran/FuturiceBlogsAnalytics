I think this creates a false impression that DesignOps is less of a concern for small teams. This, of course, is rubbish. In our experience, the core elements of DesignOps are beneficial to teams and organisations of any size, and are fundamental to growing and nurturing an effective design practice within any organisation.', '', 'If you ever find yourself saying ‚ÄúOh sh*t, now our team‚Äôs so big we‚Äôd better start thinking about DesignOps‚Ä¶‚Äù you‚Äôre likely going to find yourself at the start of an uphill struggle to retroactively define and embed standards and processes that could and should have been defined some time ago.', ""So, what‚Äôs a ‚Äòsmall team‚Äô? We‚Äôd suggest anything from 2-8 Product Designers is a small team, because between these ranges, it‚Äôs still possible to ‚Äòwing it‚Äô in regards to DesignOps. Small teams often don‚Äôt have the luxury of dedicated DesignOps roles, and therefore DesignOps must be integrated into existing roles in the team. Just because you don‚Äôt have the budget for a dedicated DesignOps function though, it doesn‚Äôt mean DesignOps isn‚Äôt for you. If you're a Design Leader who‚Äôs yet to define DesignOps standards for your team, now‚Äôs the time to start, and this article is a jumping off point for beginning that journey, based on our experiences of working with small(ish) design teams."", '', ""As a Design Leader you've no doubt heard of DesignOps (which is why you‚Äôre here reading this), and even if you're unsure of exactly what ‚ÄòDesignOps‚Äô is, in all likelihood you‚Äôre already doing it in some capacity. In fact, I‚Äôm going to put it out there that as a Design Leader of a small team, you owe it to the people you‚Äôre leading to define and implement effective DesignOps, to supercharge that team and enable those designers to do their best work."", 'So what is DesignOps exactly? There are dozens of great definitions of DesignOps out there, but here‚Äôs our take on it.', 'DesignOps is the ecosystem of standards and processes that supports design as a function within your organisation.', 'That‚Äôs a fancy way of saying that it‚Äôs a set of clearly defined ways of working that reduce friction and enable your team to focus on ‚Äòdoing design‚Äô, with clarity on how to ‚Äòdo design‚Äô. This safeguards designers from being pulled in a dozen different directions each day, trying to solve problems that should already have defined solutions.', 'We all wear a lot of different hats in our day-to-day life as a designer, and while that isn‚Äôt likely to change any time soon, without effective standards and processes around us, we can end up wearing too many hats, leaving us without enough space to focus on the big things - like delivering great design work. DesignOps is a way to minimise the number of hats our team members need to put on each day.', 'This article explores five key areas that we recommend small teams focus on in order to build solid foundations and start seeing the benefits of DesignOps:', 'Disclaimer ‚Äì As with most ways of working, there‚Äôs rarely a  one-size-fits-all approach. We don‚Äôt have all the answers, no one does. This is a collection of guidance and best practices based on our direct experience in this space.', '', 'At a high level, an organisational model is a structure for how your design team collaborates with other disciplines, and how reporting is managed. The best organisational model for you will depend on factors such as the size of your team, the capabilities within your team, and how product focused your organisation aspires to be.', 'There‚Äôs no one-size fits all organisational model that‚Äôs perfect for every team, but NN/g has created a really comprehensive guide to different organisational models for design teams, which outlines the pros and cons of the three most common models.', 'This is the traditional ‚ÄòStudio‚Äô style approach to organising a design team, with designers reporting into a Design Leader. Designers are dropped into different Product teams as and when design is needed.', 'This approach embeds designers long term into Product Teams, establishing Design as a capability within Product. In this model, Designers report directly into the Product Team.', 'The clue‚Äôs in the name, this is essentially a mix of decentralised and centralised models, with designers embedded longterm into squads, reporting into the Squad day-to-day, and a Design Leader as their primary line manager.', 'When choosing the right operational mode for your team, consider the different capabilities within the team, and how each of those capabilities can most effectively collaborate with product teams. In our experience the Hybrid model offers the greatest opportunity to establish design as a capability within Product teams, while enabling Design Leaders to shape and lead DesignOps. For smaller design teams operating in organisations with a large number of product teams, you may be limited to a centralised model until your design team grows large enough to adopt a Decentralised or Hybrid model.', '', 'What does your end-to-end design process look like? Do you have a clearly documented process that the whole team can see, or does it live in your head in some abstract form that only you can explain? A well defined end-to-end design process helps your team understand what stage their work is at, where it should have been before reaching that stage, and the direction it should be heading in. If everybody in your organisation isn‚Äôt clear on the stages of the design process, it can create friction with stakeholders and collaborators who don‚Äôt know how or when they can or should support design activities, or expect to see the outputs of design work.', 'A common challenge we see when supporting smaller teams is that they either don‚Äôt have a clearly defined design process, or they‚Äôve created their own, which usually ends up being a clunky, linear, waterfall Franken-process. For small Product teams, our advice is simple; you don‚Äôt need to reinvent the wheel. There are plenty of proven methodologies out there already such as Design Thinking, User Centred Design, and Lean UX, so find the one that‚Äôs the right fit for your needs and take it for a spin.', ""The right process is the one that‚Äôs best suited to the way your team prefers to work and the problems they‚Äôre trying to solve. At Futurice we recommend Design Thinking, which in a nutshell is a simple, non-linear, user-centred approach to solving ill defined problems. The non-linear nature of design thinking enables teams to work through the stages sequentially, or repeat them and circle back to previous stages to iterate based on new learnings. It's a solid approach to ensure that your team has identified the right problems to solve, and thoroughly validated the most effective solutions to those problems. You‚Äôll most commonly find Design Thinking presented as a 5-6 step sequence, or as a double diamond, with each essentially being different ways to visualise the same methodology."", '', 'This seems like a pretty straightforward thing to define, but there‚Äôs more to standardising your tooling than simply ensuring that the whole team is using the same tools. You should of course begin by aligning on a core toolset that your whole team will use consistently across workflows, the value of which is ensuring compatibility of design assets, and reducing complexity and business costs.', 'However, as your small team starts to grow, the bigger consideration here is, how those team members are using their tools. This is all about reducing complexity to increase day-to-day efficiency; Your goal should be ensuring that anyone, designer or otherwise, can jump into a design file and find their way around with minimum initial support, or without a facilitator. For the majority of client engagements, our core design toolset is Figma and Miro, so here are some best practices to consider for standardising these tools:', 'Whatever your day-to-day Product Design tools are, to ensure the greatest level of consistency and efficiency in your team‚Äôs work, you must agree upon and document some standards that everyone can align to. To do this, we recommend bringing your team together to discuss and capture how they prefer to use their design tools, before documenting these standards in your team‚Äôs wiki tool.', '', 'Adjacent to your standardised tooling, standardisation and centralisation of your shared design assets and documentation is one of the most impactful ways to free your team up to focus on ‚Äòdoing design‚Äô.', 'The majority of design teams we work with these days are either in the process of developing a Design System or planning to get one off the group ASAP. Establishing a single source of truth for the design elements shared by your team and the products they support, is essential for reducing complexity and inefficiency across design activities, and for freeing up designers to focus on ‚Äòdoing design‚Äô. An effective design library is a cross-functional resource, co-created by designers and engineers to ensure that both practices are benefiting from it in the fullest sense.', 'Building a Design Library is a big task, but luckily for you, Futurice recently published an extensive guide to our approach to helping teams plan and build their first Design Library, which you can read here.', 'Having well defined ways of working is great, but these standards need a place to live, where everybody in your team can easily find them. At Futurice, we‚Äôve found that a team wiki is the most effective way to document design ways of working. A well structured team wiki can be a beneficial resource for long serving team members to check standards and practices, as well as for helping to onboard new starters. Things to include in your wiki:', 'Building and scaling effective DesignOps standards, much like building effective digital products, is an ongoing, iterative process, and therefore teams need a way to track their DesignOps workflow and initiatives. Creating a dedicated DesignOps backlog and tracking it through a kanban board, can really help yourself and your team to track and prioritise your DesignOps initiatives. Things to consider when setting up DesignOps backlog include:', 'You can treat your DesignOps backlog the same as any other product backlog, writing clear, detailed tasks or stories, and regulatory coming together as a team to review the priority and progress of these initiatives.', 'Try to think of your team wiki as a hub, or a ‚Äògo-to‚Äô place for your design team to seek answers about their design standards and ways of working, ensuring that your wiki guidance links out to your other tools, such as your design system and DesignOps backlog. This approach ensures that every team member knows where to go first if they‚Äôre not sure how to do something, or where to find something.', '', 'Transparency and openness are some of the best markers of decent design culture, and a key purpose of DesignOps is embedding these values in your team‚Äôs ways of working.', 'A lot of the time Designers simply aren‚Äôt sure when to seek feedback from the wider Design Team, especially when they‚Äôre getting a lot of feedback from their individual Product Team peers. As such it‚Äôs the responsibility of Design Leaders to create appropriate opportunities for the team to raise transparency.', 'Being embedded longterm in a single Product team is the best way to properly integrate UX with Agile delivery teams, and ensure that Designers gain the deepest understanding of the product they‚Äôre accountable for. However, with this setup there‚Äôs less opportunity for designers to keep up to speed with what their peers are doing, and contribute to broader design culture within the organisation. Here are some simple and effective practices to consider for improving transparency and embedding a feedback culture in your team:', 'A really simple way to raise visibility across the team, especially when following a hybrid model, is to ask everyone to share their YTBs (Yesterday, Today, Blockers) each day on your asynchronous comms tool. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with YTBs, they usually look a little something like this:', 'Y - What I worked on yesterday‚Ä¶\nT - What I‚Äôll work on today‚Ä¶\nB - Anything that‚Äôs blocking my progress and I need help with‚Ä¶', 'Ask each team member to share their YTB each morning in a Design Team channel, (or if you‚Äôre using Slack, set up an automated daily reminder) ensuring that they‚Äôre reading their team mate‚Äôs YTBs, and looking out for any blockers they might be able to help with. This also gives team members an opportunity to see if their team mates are working on anything that may impact their own work.', 'A great way to finish the working week is to bring the team together to share updates on the interesting work they‚Äôve done that week. This gives the design team another opportunity to inspect each other‚Äôs work, ask questions and seek peer feedback. A simple format for these sessions is to give each team member 5-10 mins to do a weekly focused YTB, e.g. what they worked on this week, what they‚Äôll be focusing on next week, and any support needs they might have.', 'Much like your product backlog, your DesignOps backlog needs regular refinement to prevent it from getting too shabby. Regularly bringing the whole Design team together to inspect and adapt your DesignOps backlog is another great way to embed transparency and get designers discussing, defining and prioritising initiatives. Discussion is the key to getting the most out of these sessions, you should aim to encourage healthy debate on the initiatives that are being defined by the team, to ensure that you‚Äôre capturing a broad array of viewpoints to inform your team‚Äôs standards.', 'Every couple of weeks is often a good cadence for these backlog grooming sessions, but as always, find a cadence that works for your team and approach to DesignOps.', 'This is an area that‚Äôs often a challenge for Decentralised Product Design Teams, but it‚Äôs a problem that can rear its head in any organisational model. Creating formalised, recurring sessions for the team to come together and share their work and ideas is a great starting point but for a feedback culture to really take root, Design Leaders need to help their team get accustomed to self-initiated transparency. Encouraging designers to invite their colleagues to impromptu review and sparring sessions, and building communities of practice for different design topics can greatly improve knowledge sharing and transparency across the team.', '', 'DesignOps is a big, expansive topic, with a great deal more considerations than we can cover in this starter guide, but the five areas we have covered here are the ones that we most often see absent in small design teams, and which subsequently have the largest impact on the ability of those teams effectively and efficiently manage their day-to-day design duties.

To do this without creating a total mess, you need to facilitate dialogue around data, increase awareness of significant biases in thinking, and ensure that creative ideas that challenge conventions are not killed when making strategic decisions.', 'Let‚Äôs look at some practical tips for facilitating high-quality, strategic and data-driven decisions in management meetings. Good group decision-making is about connecting innovative use of data and managing the group dynamics of people discussing it together. I‚Äôll focus on the people side of decision-making: how to create a common understanding of alternatives and how you can guide the group to reach a decision together. While new real-time data and AI solutions are useful for decision-making, they are complex, and the skills to facilitate dialogue are increasingly crucial.', 'To improve decision-making, we must first understand and prioritize what problem we are actually trying to solve. Based on my own experience, the most common challenges include', 'Decision-making structures, leadership systems, data architecture and capabilities, and different elements of organizational culture also play a role in making successful strategic data-driven decisions, but in this article, I‚Äôll focus on what you can do in a decision-making situation.', 'Guiding groups in making decisions is a core competence of any facilitator. A typical element of a group process is described as a ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù that has an equal amount of time for divergent and convergent thinking. In a meeting, you might have several topics. Open each topic up for discussion, develop alternatives (divergence), narrow options, and make decisions (convergence). Too much emphasis on divergence and time running during convergence is a typical problem in many meetings and workshops.  ', 'When you need more alternatives and out-of-the-box thinking, spend \nmore time diverging in various ways. A break to incubate ideas between diverging and converging is recommended ‚Äì anywhere between an hour and a few days. If the time is limited, keep divergence short. Finishing early and finding a new time to continue is better than trying to stretch the meeting.', 'When you want to reach a decision that is well thought out and accepted by all decision-makers, you need to spend more time on converging. Slow down convergence by going through these steps.  ', ""Not all situations need to go through all the steps, but using only one or two steps may result in poor-quality decisions. It's important to keep in mind that there are alternatives to just voting or, even worse, unintentionally letting the loudest decide."", 'With the hectic meeting schedules of everyday working life, helping groups see the systemic level of issues is challenging. Lack of systemic thinking can lead to unintended consequences, sub optimization, missed opportunities, and new problems. Too often, facilitators begin by asking groups to create and cluster ideas when they should ask people to create and prioritize key questions.', 'Management team meetings often deal with a wide variety of topics ‚Äì some strategic, some tactical, and some operational decisions. This makes it difficult for group members to catch the right level of abstraction and time span. Keep strategic discussion separate from operational matters. We should always address the right problem at the right time on the right level.', 'When you prepare a meeting, evaluate each topic at hand: is it a problem to be solved or a polarity to be managed? These require very different approaches to decision-making. Have the courage to apply non-linear thinking and foster it with pauses that enhance incubation: you can diverge in one meeting and converge in another.', 'Many decisions in management team meetings are made without any method; people just discuss matters, and at some point, the meeting leader concludes the decision. This way of making decisions emphasizes the impact of the loudest person in the room. In the end, all members of the group may not agree with or commit to the decision.', 'Facilitating a converging discussion involves checking that everyone has had a say and that the options are spelled out so that everyone can see them. Different voting methods are also common, but they all have a fundamental problem: when voting, some people win, and some lose. It hinders commitment and can emphasize silos instead of the feeling of making a choice together and sharing responsibility.', 'When narrowing down options, you can avoid the ‚Äúloudest decides‚Äù issue by asking people to think about the decision alone, discussing it with another person, and then one more person. After discussions in pairs or small groups, people have more courage to bring their opinions into the larger group discussion. This method is called me-we-us. It is one of the simplest facilitation methods, yet rarely used in management team meetings. It prevents the group discussion from anchoring to the first point of view presented and encourages more viewpoints to surface.', ""Idealogue is a similar method. It structures narrowing down options in a way that motivates people to listen to each other's ideas, develop them further, and come up with shared ideas that more people experience as their own. Combine it with Dartboard or Field of Criteria to clearly visualize the outcomes."", 'Simple convergence methods', 'Choosing a well-communicated and familiar option is easy; understanding other peoples‚Äô points of view can be challenging even when using me-we-us. Great facilitation methods are available for clarifying complex topics, finding the right abstraction level, and mapping the system around the topic at hand. Methods such as Dynamic Facilitation, Appreciative Inquiry, Challenge Mapping, or Polarity Management can be used when the topic is complex or emotional. These methods provide structure for thinking and talking together.', 'Imagine if the management team could be presented with almost real-time information about, for example, what kind of competencies competitors are investing in or how the behavior of their own personnel has changed. It would enable data-oriented and well-structured discussions to streamline and focus the business.', 'The opportunity to use data and AI to gain insights about a specific problem is so inspiring that we are at risk of forgetting the human aspect. Emotions and intuition are also sources of information. They convey to us a message that we need to listen to alongside data. Note that people tend to present their opinions as facts and are likely to spend more time discussing easy questions than dwelling on mentally uncomfortable matters. We also tend to pay more attention to information that supports our own assumptions and experience.', 'When preparing for the decision-making meeting, you must prepare the process, methods, and content. Content preparation can be a divergence-focused workshop or a desk study and data research. Often decisions are made based on pre-defined options.', 'Saying ‚Äúno‚Äù is also a decision and has consequences. If you bring in options to choose from, try to describe them on the same abstraction level. Usually, the no-go option is not described as thoroughly as others.', 'Solutions to using data in decision-making in an iterative way', 'Sometimes when I look at the vision statements and strategies of different companies, they seem rather alike, and I wonder if there is enough courage to break the rules.

Access to a variety of perspectives is one of the biggest value adds of engaging larger groups of people in strategic discussions. Participants also learn about alternative viewpoints, which makes it easier for them to understand that their opinion is not the only one that counts.', 'Get the data and derive insights, in person or with the help of AI tools.

His career journey has taken him around the world, but luckily for us, he‚Äôs currently happily settled at Futurice in Stockholm.', 'By coincidence! I was working as a consultant in the Stockholm office of a Dutch insurance software company, helping clients configure their software when eventually the office closed and I was made redundant. I already felt that my job was a bit unsatisfying and too domain-specific, so when I noticed a highly rated coding bootcamp, Le Wagon, that was about to start just four days after my job ended, it felt like it was meant to be.', 'When I finished the course, Covid had just started, so it wasn‚Äôt the best time to be job hunting, but I eventually got an interview at Futurice and things really clicked ‚Äì I‚Äôve been here for two years now.', 'It wasn‚Äôt just good timing. I‚Äôd done some coding on Udemy before, but I prefer teacher-led learning, so the bootcamp was a better environment for me. Coding appealed because I appreciate having skills that are recognized globally, giving me the flexibility to move anywhere in the world. My brother is a developer, but I always thought you need a maths brain to do it ‚Äì turns out that‚Äôs not the case though. After playing around a bit I realized anyone can learn and I really enjoyed it. That was a nice revelation.', 'Problem solving. I think it‚Äôs really fun to have a puzzle and figure out how to solve it. In this field it doesn‚Äôt take long to find out if you‚Äôre on the right path, so there‚Äôs some instant gratification, and then getting to the eventual solution is satisfying. Working with other people and discussing problems together is also very rewarding. I‚Äôve taken up a mentorship role at Futurice so I can help others who are starting out in their careers, both new recruits and trainees.', 'The people aspect.

We look at why, and what they can do about it.","['So what is it that MyBMW and Mini apps do to warrant such high ratings?', 'What‚Äôs at stake here, and why do OEMs need to up their game?', 'So what could the future look like for car apps?', 'In conclusion', 'Synthesising driver feedback']","['Today, every major auto manufacturer offers a connected car app or ‚Äúcompanion app‚Äù, as they‚Äôre often known. For the most part, these apps offer users basic remote control features such as car locking / unlocking, displaying status in various ways (e.g. fuel or battery charge level) and operating the climate control system.', 'While some of the most highly rated apps on the market go further in terms of functionality, from a technical and user experience (UX) performance perspective, the general standard of this class of app is low.', '‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù I hear you ask. It‚Äôs a great question. I think there are three factors at play:', 'To get a better sense of how various car apps perform for drivers in the wild, with some help from a Python script and ChatGPT, we analysed recent user / driver feedback for 18 different OEM car apps (BMW, Mini, Volvo, Audi, Mercedes, Mazda, Nissan, Ford, Tesla, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, Lexus, Honda, Toyota, Jaguar, Land Rover, Porsche and Polestar). The complete report can be found here.', 'There are some bright spots, but overall, the majority of apps fall short of delivering on their promises. We appreciate that reviewers are a self-selecting group, often motivated by a poor experience than a good or just ok one ‚Äì but it‚Äôs still not going to be comfortable reading for the OEMs. Interestingly, whilst there was a shared sentiment among users that the apps would benefit from more modern and intuitive UIs, the points of real frustration come from problems connecting apps to their cars, slow response times, frequent crashes, inaccurate data and significant battery drain caused by the apps. Device compatibility, limited functionality and poor customer support were also cited as issues that left users feeling dissatisfied.', 'This speaks to my earlier points about the level of technical complexity in this domain, and the fact that many OEMs are still lacking the necessary digital and data capabilities needed to differentiate in the market in a sustainable way.', 'Despite some common challenges, some apps are performing much better than others. The MyBMW and Mini apps top the UK charts, with average app store ratings of 4.7 and 4.6 (out of 5) respectively. Porsche and Polestar, two brands that should be synonymous with high performance, come in last with a measly 2.4 and 2.1.', 'Another great question, which I‚Äôll gladly unpack.', 'For those that don‚Äôt know, Mini is BMW owned, so there‚Äôs a good level of commonality between their apps and there are benefits from sharing learning and best practice. Both offer remote controlled car functionality via the app, but have expanded to cover the growing functionality of the vehicles themselves. The apps have developed into areas such as sustainability with trip planning and statistics, as well as charging functionality, remote and keyless entry, booking a service with a local dealer and more granular data on the car‚Äôs status.', 'BMW‚Äôs approach has been to establish these mobile applications as continuously evolving platforms that can provide real utility to drivers in a range of different contexts. It‚Äôs clear from their app ratings that users are responding positively. BMW is a long-standing client of ours, so we know that they see their app as a crucial brand asset. They also have an extremely rigorous approach to user research ‚Äì leaving no stone unturned in terms of analysing and responding to customer feedback, app store ratings and usage data.', 'As consumers we know what a good digital experience looks like, and the quality of digital touchpoints that connect with our cars are increasingly important to us. These touchpoints need to live up to a brand‚Äôs ethos, and should start pre-purchase and continue through the user lifecycle and beyond. The excitement of driving a shiny new motor can sour very quickly if the digital experience underwhelms.', ""The business risks of failing to meet customer expectations with your car app are real and serious ‚Äì increased safety risk (without proper smartphone integration, drivers might be tempted to use their phones manually while driving), damage to brand image and decreased perception of innovation (a car that doesn't support seamless smartphone integration might be perceived as less innovative or technologically behind), missed revenue opportunities and limited data collection."", 'Brand loyalty in the automotive industry isn‚Äôt what it was 20 years ago (my Dad was a Saab man for most of my childhood), and the level of competition in the European auto sector is only getting fiercer. Disruptors like Tesla and other pure EV OEMs, including a new wave of Chinese players, are ‚Äúborn digital‚Äù, forward-leaning and expected to shape the EV market and customers expectations. So in this context, a poor performing car app will increasingly be a deal-breaker for potential customers. This all boils down to loss of market share over time for those manufacturers that continue to undervalue their digital touchpoints.', ""In the near future (next two years), I expect we‚Äôll see all car apps improve, with laggards desperately trying to catch up with today's leaders, and today‚Äôs leaders making the most of their early advantage. While the possibilities with these apps are huge, it‚Äôs still early days, and most OEMs are very risk averse. That means we can expect the majority of new innovations and app services to be closely related to driving ‚Äì but more personalised, automated and with more payments integration ‚Äì with the ultimate aim of making drivers‚Äô lives easier and safer."", 'Longer term, I expect we‚Äôll start to see fewer screens in our cars, and smartphones and car apps becoming a more integral part of the car‚Äôs interface. This could fundamentally change a car‚Äôs UX, and would enable a completely new level of personalisation for drivers. In time, cars will know who‚Äôs stepping into them and adjust entertainment, seating, climate and even driving mode settings for each individual driver within a family or business, automatically. Apps will allow for more advanced safety features ‚Äì such as vehicle diagnostics and predictive maintenance alerts, real-time tracking of vehicle vitals, advanced GPS features for better route optimisation, and safety alerts for erratic driving behaviours. They‚Äôll also be much more connected to an ever-expanding digital ecosystem, and integrate with an array of other services designed to improve our personal and financial wellbeing. I think we‚Äôll even be having two way conversations with our cars by 2030, Knight Rider style. If that leaves you feeling a little unnerved, I suggest you keep hold of your Golf.', 'All of the above capabilities will be enabled by modern software, machine learning and connectivity, but also new ways of working, and potentially new ways of organising companies around value streams. We‚Äôre talking about change on an enterprise-level, both technically and culturally. While this shift is undoubtedly challenging, it needs to happen for traditional players to still be relevant in the era of autonomous, connected, electric and shared vehicles that we‚Äôre working towards.', 'I‚Äôm very excited to see how the market evolves in the years ahead, and we‚Äôll be doing our bit to help our OEM clients compete and continue to win in this new battleground.', 'This is an objective, user-centred review of the top-rated automotive companion apps in the UK, using direct app store data. The direct user feedback in this report gives a valuable snapshot into how individuals interact with companion apps.']","['Mindset of traditional OEMs: I am generalising here, but most traditional OEMs still undervalue the digital elements of their overall customer experience, and underinvest as a result. The car is king! OEMs also fail to recognise the significance of smartphones as the centre of our digital lives, and see car apps as more of a hygiene factor. To add to that, there‚Äôs an element of OEMs clinging on to old business models that have served them well in the past.', 'Digital capabilities of OEMs: Digital product development is still a fairly new thing for many OEMs. Some have established capable cross-functional digital product teams, and boast reasonable levels of maturity in terms of their Agile, User Centred Design (UCD) and DevOps. However, effective product work requires wider business and culture change to happen, and that‚Äôs not easy in the automotive industry, where old ways of doing things are often deeply entrenched.', ""Technical complexity of developing connected digital products: Getting two devices to talk to one another reliably is not trivial. Far from it. It‚Äôs very difficult, and in the case of car companion apps, they often have to communicate with a multitude of different vehicle systems (like the infotainment system, engine control unit, etc). Car apps also rely on some form of wireless connection (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular, etc) and problems with these connections (e.g weak signal or interference) can impact an app‚Äôs functionality and performance. Other technical challenges include hardware and software limitations in the vehicle. Certain cars may lack the necessary hardware grunt to operate effectively with the latest handsets, and similarly, a vehicle's underlying operating system may not be designed for high-performing apps.""]"

How awesome would it be to hold up a mirror, show them what‚Äôs cooking in their industry according to data, and hear their perspectives? As it happens, that tool already exists: it‚Äôs called text mining, and best of all, it doesn‚Äôt even need magic to work!', 'Two weeks prior to the conference, I connected with my colleague Tuomas Syrj√§nen, co-founder Futurice. Tuomas is an expert in data and artificial intelligence, and is passionate about exploring and learning from data. Whenever the databases or data sets he is working with don‚Äôt offer sufficient ways to search for what he needs, he writes additional code to help him dig deeper.', 'During our chat, Tuomas instantly recognized the problem I was facing. Fortunately, he was also able to tell me about the possibilities of text mining and how I could put it to good use. Here‚Äôs what I learned from him.', 'As a company, you want to stay on top of your game, ahead of the competition and aware of the market. This will enable you to work proactively so that you‚Äôre not at the mercy of the circumstances, but rather in control of how your organization is navigating the changing realities of business.', 'To do so, you can do a variety of traditional steps ‚Äì like doing desk research or talking to people and learning from them ‚Äì but the market is big. How do you get the big picture?', 'Text mining is a process that focuses around recognizing and extracting patterns from large collections of data. It makes key concepts, trends and relationships visible, giving you insights to base your decisions on and validate assumptions with. It can also point out your blind spots where you need to delve deeper and learn more.', 'Text mining is used to search for answers or tendencies in databases, on social media, in job listing services, and so on. Databases can be any number of different sources, for example news articles, press releases, patent libraries, academic articles, social media. At Futurice, we have paid to gain access to various relevant databases and data sets ‚Äì our playground for doing text mining.', 'But a database as such is just a starting point. To make a search in a database, you need two key things:', 'Once you have outlined your focus and data points, you can start to investigate different databases and data sets:', 'Answers to these questions can support companies as they rethink their own position in the market, and help them gain inspiration when creating strategies, developing new products and services, evaluating their value chain, and so on.', 'When exploring the possibilities of text mining, one of the most important things is to stay curious, and routinely remind yourself that you are on a journey! Keep asking yourself why you‚Äôre doing text mining and what you‚Äôre trying to achieve with it, and search in several data sources to validate your insights.', '‚ÄúWhat is the most relevant question to answer,‚Äù you might be asking, and the answer is that the most relevant question will always change over time. Be willing to shift your question as you learn ‚Äì you might realize you haven‚Äôt been focusing on what‚Äôs important from the beginning.', 'It‚Äôs also important to be aware of confirmation bias. If your data fits your purpose, you might be able to see the results you want it in the data. But are you just trying to confirm what you would like to see? Remember to challenge your approach and be aware of your own biases.', 'Are your data sets representative? On a global scale, you‚Äôll most likely have higher access to data from the US than from other countries. We should expect data from (developing) countries to not be anywhere near as widely represented or available as data from the western world. Consider whether you need to combine different methods to get more representative insights.', 'To gain an overview of what is happening in the health industry, Tuomas took a deep dive into data sets with news articles, press releases and patents. Here‚Äôs what he learned:', '1. Sustainability\nUnsurprisingly, sustainability is a trending keyword also in the health industry, and it is discussed significantly more actively in the U.S. than in Europe. In Europe, the sustainability discussion is dominated by waste and recycling, while in the U.S., environmental aspects are discussed more. Among the growing topics in Europe are emissions and air quality, and in the U.S., trending topics in include environmental factors, emissions and ESG.', '2. Telehealth\nTelehealth is an emerging topic that gained traction during the pandemic, driven by an increased need for online consultations. Telehealth, however, is much more than that ‚Äì it is also about optimizing outpatient settings, monitoring patients, and offering wearables as well as other products and services that help keep patients at home. We were not surprised to learn that this is a trending topic, given the number of patents registered in this area. Telehealth is primarily discussed in U.S. hospitals, not so much in European ones.', '3. Hiring for data expertise\nThe majority of actors in the healthcare industry aim to create more coherent journeys for both patients and healthcare professionals. This is made possible only if actors, products, services and systems in healthcare work in unison and share more than they do today. The industry needs to become more connected, and share data more actively. Our text mining exercise showed that in general, there is a lot of talk about data sharing, yet open positions are all about software developers ‚Äì not data engineers and data scientists. Open positions related to data are much more common in other industries.', '4. Patents in health\nThe number of patents focusing on digital surgery, digital operating rooms and 3D printing are growing steadily. So far, the industry has been focusing a lot on robotic surgery. The next step along that path is digital surgery, which requires introducing artificial intelligence and machine learning to assist in surgery planning and decision making ‚Äì as well as remote patient monitoring using sensors and wearables; AR/VR assisted tools for education, training and visualization; and finally, better networks and connectivity to enable real-time data sharing and remote surgery.', '5. Interoperability\nInteroperability is the ability of two or more systems to exchange health information and use the information once it is received. It is a huge topic in health and one of the key success factors required for a better experience for both patients and healthcare professionals. Our text mining effort revealed that currently, only US hospitals tend to discuss interoperability. It also showed that the topic is gaining traction among tech companies (e.g. Microsoft and Oracle) as well as software companies (such as Epic).', 'In our roundtable event, these insights sparked interesting conversations. The findings themselves were discussed at length, but they also served as an invitation for the participants to share their organizations‚Äô perspectives ‚Äì which also gave rise to an interesting exchange. The findings clearly sparked a lot of interest, and the participants were curious about where the data came from.', 'The results of the roundtable were encouraging and certainly did their part to motivate us to keep digging deeper into the topics and learn more. After all, a learning journey should ideally not stop, but rather continue in an iterative cycle.', 'Ideally, text mining should be used in iterations, starting with exploring high-level questions. After gaining the first insights, it‚Äôs time to reflect on those, refocus and decide to go in one direction, to zoom in on something. After that, the learning circle starts again.', 'Text mining is great for gaining insights, learning about various tendencies, and identifying problems. It typically serves to start conversations, not end them. It helps us identify which topics we should dig deeper into or which questions we should explore. Ideally, you should repeat the exercise regularly to learn more ‚Äì and combine it with other methods like qualitative interviews, which dig deeper, validate, and give you more insights to work with.', 'Using text mining to gain an overview of your problem landscape and the issues prevalent in your industry can help you open your eyes, sharpen your focus, leverage conversations, and make decisions more efficiently. For the time being, involving a data scientist or data engineer to explore data is highly beneficial, but I believe that in the very near future, AI-enabled search engines will allow anyone to ask questions and get well structured answers.']","['Focus: What question are we asking? What would be relevant to look into and learn about? In our health industry example, we had very high-level questions: What is the main focus in news articles, or at conferences? What can we learn from patents?', 'Data points to start with: In our case, in which clinics do we look for answers? We decided to focus on a selection of the largest clinics ‚Äì five in the U.S. and nine in Europe ‚Äì as we wanted to learn about the differences between the two markets.', 'Which patents are being registered in a certain area? We know that if something is patented, it will be mainstream in the next year or two. This can give companies a good indication of what their competitors are focusing on, enabling them to ask themselves how and where they want to position themselves in this game.', 'What open positions are being posted in the industry and what can we learn from them? Job listings tell a lot about a company ‚Äì they reveal what the strategic focus is, what new technologies are being explored, what skills are wanted, and so on.', 'What topics do companies talk about, and which keywords are essential to them? This tells a lot about their strategic ‚Äì or at least operational ‚Äì focus.', 'What do companies say about mergers and acquisitions or strategic partnerships? This can give you an idea about how a company is expanding (or planning to).', 'How do companies talk about their products and services, and which new products and services are they launching? It can be inspiring to learn and take cues from what others are engaging with the market. \nAnswers to these questions can support companies as they rethink their own position in the market, and help them gain inspiration when creating strategies, developing new products and services, evaluating their value chain, and so on.']"

Initially, we explored the ecosystem concept and the importance of embracing a data-powered, customer-centric model. Then, to demonstrate the impact of ecosystems, we invented a fictitious company called JRS ‚Äì a leading supplier of knee, hip and other joint replacement implants to an extensive network of private and public hospitals. ', 'In order to stay relevant and competitive, JRS needs to transform itself by providing a full-service, API-driven digital platform which embraces the latest standards of connectivity and interoperability. Through this interoperable platform approach it enables a digital ecosystem that supports customers and healthcare practitioners across every stage of their joint replacement journey.', 'In this blog, we focus on two (fictional) partners‚Äô in JRS‚Äôs ecosystem ‚Äì FutureOps and Medicalendar.io. We explore how they might be helped to grow exponentially using JRS‚Äôs new business model, and why JRS‚Äôs new approach should work to their advantage.', 'FutureOps is a leading provider of digital high tech tools and equipment for operating theatres. Its goal is to help healthcare providers improve the efficiency of surgical treatment, while making it less expensive and invasive for patients. It provides digital tools and equipment for a wide range of procedures and is aware of JRS‚Äôs track record in joint replacement.', 'Until recently, FutureOps has viewed JRS simply as a trusted product supplier. But now that JRS has repositioned itself as a data-driven platform, there is potential for closer collaboration. The new-look JRS is a mine of information about patients‚Äô pre-operative and post-operative experience. It also has a pool of data derived from thousands of knee transplant procedures that can be used to identify patterns based on lived experience.', ""FutureOps‚Äô clients (hospitals and surgeons) have a pretty good track record on knee replacements, but the company knows that a meaningful percentage of procedures don't work. JRS‚Äôs data is generated by sensors that feedback information from replacement joints on a 24/7 basis. By leaning into this data, FutureOps can identify if there are repeat factors that occur in unsuccessful or partially successful outcomes."", 'What‚Äôs more, FutureOps can feed relevant insights from JRS into a ‚Äòdigital twin‚Äô of the patient ‚Äì an AI/machine learning generated doppelganger that is used to make surgical judgements before the real patient is wheeled into the operating theatre. The end result of this data-driven collaboration is that FutureOps, patients, surgeons and hospitals may all benefit from a higher success rate. Meanwhile, with its new API-driven data platform capability, the wider variety of services it offers all boasting the latest standards of interoperability, JRS can increase its share of the implants market. After all, hospitals, HCPs and partners such as FutureOps are keen to work with a company that can offer a one-stop-shop to  solve a greater range of pain points in a way that is baked into their workflow.', 'Medicalendar.io‚Äôs mission is to make the admin behind  a patient‚Äôs treatment process as smooth as possible. Having started as a basic appointment booking service, it has been reinvented as a responsive scheduling tool that manages a patient‚Äôs treatment plan from first appointment to final sign-off. It aims to support the best outcome for patients, while reducing inefficiencies in care provision.', 'This, of course, is a complex and dynamic system that requires data inputs from the patient‚Äôs key points of contact (doctor‚Äôs surgery, hospital and consultant) and the various stakeholders, of which JRS and FutureOps are two. In practice, Medicalendar.io takes the form of an online dashboard that both the patient and their healthcare providers can access (with voice activation for those who find digital tech challenging). Diary dates and likely timeframes are entered into the patient‚Äôs profile and updated as landmarks are reached or unexpected events come along. If the patient is due to have an operation on a certain date, but is sick ‚Äì this appointment is moved, stakeholders are informed and someone else may see their operation fast-tracked. If a backlog means that an operation is delayed, then proposed dates for post-operative physio are moved.', 'For JRS, there are supply chain benefits in knowing dates have changed. For HCPs, accurate scheduling means greater efficiency but also ensures that the patient is receiving personalized care.', 'It‚Äôs not too difficult to see how JRS, FutureOps and Medicalendar.io might benefit from this kind of mutually-beneficial ecosystem. But what kind of factors will come into play as they seek to get their plan off the ground?', 'Value-based healthcare is paramount: Ecosystems need to be a win-win for all stakeholders, however patient health outcomes must be the priority. In our example, the over-riding ambition of JRS‚Äôs ecosystem and of its participants, is to deliver seamless, responsive and effective patient care. It is not a technological cartel that sees the patient as an asset to be squeezed. If constructed carefully, JRS end users (patients) will receive the right treatment within an optimal timeframe and at an acceptable price and will live healthier lives. At the same time, various business benefits will flow out to the partners that made this possible.', 'Privacy is a potential obstacle: Banking customers have generally accepted interoperability in the banking sector as a benefit, with open banking driving faster and more personalised decision-making. In theory, healthcare is the same, though patients will probably need great reassurance before allowing sensitive information to be shared. Key to this will be convincing patients they retain ownership or control over their data. Ecosystem partners will have to demonstrate to patients that data-sharing is in their interest in line with European Health Data Space best practice guidelines. ', 'Generosity should be a core value: The ecosystem model brings together companies that are experts in their field and helps all of them expand their business through a collaborative agenda. What‚Äôs more, an effective ecosystem will invariably open up previously unimagined business opportunities. Research shows that generous systems which (for example) share resources and information widely, deliver greater competitive advantage than those that don‚Äôt.', 'In this case, a combined pool of data in the JRS ecosystem could be used to build digital-first training programmes that draw on tools like VR/ASR and data visualisation. The bottom line is that the best business outcome for ecosystem participants generally comes when they share expertise and resources while respecting each other‚Äôs cultural and commercial strengths.', ""Ecosystems should be inclusive not exclusive: It‚Äôs important to respect the partners within your ecosystem ‚Äì but that doesn't mean JRS needs to restrict itself to one set of alliances. For example, if JRS‚Äôs knee replacements are fitted with sensors, then the company is building up a mass of data about how its products are being used and where. Companies in sportswear, wearables, fitness and travel might all be unable to unlock insights based on this data.""]",[]

This is reflected in the most commonly (28%) indicated challenge indicated by respondents ‚Äì the complexity of issues. Companies will need a comprehensive overview of all functions and areas to get a clear understanding of the big picture. Silos need to be broken down to reduce complexity smoothly and in a structured way.', 'A quarter (25%) of respondents were concerned about the lack of support from legislation, and a similar share of respondents (23%) also indicated the lack of resources as a challenge when implementing twin transition. Twin transition often requires significant investments in technology, training and infrastructure. This is a problem particularly for companies with limited financial resources.

', 'The Internet of Things has been a topic of discussion for many years, and its potential applications in machinery and industrial settings continue to expand. In this blog post, we will delve into the value generation of IoT solutions for machinery and industrial companies, providing real-world examples of their benefits and discussing areas that need further development.', ""Connected IoT solutions can enhance the performance of machinery and industrial companies in several ways. Using connected IoT-enabled sensors and devices, companies can collect and utilize real-time data on their machines' performance and health, enabling them to predict and address potential failures before they lead to costly downtime. When it comes to machines located in remote areas, it is particularly important to get maintenance done at the right time and have spare parts available, as dispatching parts and personnel onsite for maintenance during a breakdown might be very challenging."", 'Futurice has helped crane spreader manufacturer Bromma launch a spreader monitoring system, a secure and scalable cloud-based system to monitor and control a spreader‚Äôs status. It allows Bromma‚Äôs customers to remotely monitor their individual spreaders anywhere in the world, to check performance and immediately track down faults. In ports, as in any other industry, equipment uptime is a key performance indicator. Approximately 30‚Äì50 percent of a crane‚Äôs downtime is spreader related. If the spreader fails, so will the crane ‚Äì generating a massive cost when loading operations stop.

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical assets, processes or systems, and they can be used to simulate, analyze, and optimize their real-world counterparts. Over time, they accumulate data about the system, its operation and the environment, and this data can be used to build intelligence using analytics, physics and machine learning.', 'In the context of IoT, digital twins can be used in conjunction with IoT-enabled sensors and devices to create a comprehensive representation of machinery, industrial facilities and operations. This allows companies to perform advanced analytics, simulate and optimize their operations, and predict potential issues before they occur. We expect digital twins to greatly increase the operational planning of various industrial processes or autonomous equipment work in cargo handling, mining and manufacturing.', 'Despite promising applications, a few of which we‚Äôve mentioned above, there are challenges and misconceptions that have to be addressed. In the following, we‚Äôll focus on three prevalent ones ‚Äì interoperability, scale, and data management.', 'One of the main problems is the lack of standardization in the IoT space. With numerous devices and platforms available, integrating them into a cohesive system can be a daunting task. Industry-wide standardization is needed to facilitate seamless integration and interoperability between different devices, platforms and vendors. This will enable industrial companies to create more cohesive and efficient IoT ecosystems.', 'To tackle interoperability challenges, different cloud vendors have rolled out their own software suites like the Azure IoT Hub, AWS Greengrass and Google Manufacturing Data Engine. They provide a simpler way to set up the basic infrastructure and enable their customers to focus on building custom solutions, which in turn will offer real competitive advantage.', 'Another challenge is the sheer (assumed) size of projects when it comes to starting to build an IoT platform. A common misconception is that you need to equip everything with connectivity and that it‚Äôll take years to get anything concrete out before it starts generating value.

This technology is currently evolving so fast, that things in this blog post will most likely be outdated quite quickly. New services, better (or worse) end user license agreements or privacy policies, and refined legislation are continuously being introduced. Enjoy reading how the state of things are in May 2023!', 'The tools used in software development have been getting better continuously since the early days of the craft. Manually coding everything from scratch has been enhanced with open source libraries which (usually) solve common problems which developers would otherwise be solving over and over again all over the world. This has greatly reduced waste, as in time which could be allocated to solve meaningful business problems.', 'Code editors (or IDEs) have brought in autocomplete features and linters have been introduced to keep the codebase nice and tidy, while automated security & quality checks are provided by a boatload of different tools on the market. Github Copilot and its code generating abilities were originally launched in 2021 with its private use licensing scheme.', 'But it was ChatGPT which became publicly available in late November 2022 that triggered a new era of generative AI tools which all claim to boost productivity and also make human developers obsolete in the next five years. Or so some people are saying. I tend to be the skeptic in the room when any new shiny thing starts to become overly hyped and taken into use without thinking twice.', 'However, instead of going to the Winchester, having a pint, and waiting for all this to blow over, the speed of this trend makes it mandatory to provide our people access to these tools and encourage them to learn and apply their strengths to benefit our Clients (but not without asking first, as we‚Äôre about to learn also of the caveats).', 'At the time of writing this blog (as this might be obsolete in a few weeks), main tools related to Generative AI at Futurice are the Github Copilot for Business, ChatGPT Plus, and OpenAI tools available in Azure through the magic of APIs. We also work with a number of other LLM tools, but those three are the most notable ones.', 'Based on our experiences so far, and even as highly potential technologies these are, we don‚Äôt yet see an existential threat to software development as a profession. Tools have proved to be highly efficient in handling dull repetitive tasks, but their capability to magically write complex custom business logic which needs to handle several integrations and take care of company specific security measures is another thing. There‚Äôs still a need for professional programmers to handle the complexity and ensure privacy/security requirements are met, while using the AI as their sidekick.', 'The internet is filled with examples where these tools are good, but based on our experiences from real-world projects, these tools currently shine most in generating test data, writing acceptance tests from documentation, producing documentation (a thing many developers usually despise!), automatically generating repetitive blocks of code and solving challenging problems related to algorithms and data structures.', 'Besides the tools being used to boost our own development workflows, we are introducing large language model based solutions to our Clients in various ways. We are continuously learning together with our Clients on what is actually possible and feasible in different industries and defining the reference architectures as we go since these are not yet too widely available with everything being so bleeding edge.', 'Our approach in utilizing AI at Futurice has always been to pay attention to the responsible use of these almost magical tools. These tools bring a lot of good to the table, but not without some downsides.', 'Most notably the discussions around the world focus on IPR and its both sides: fear of accidentally utilizing e.g. generated code which is actually licensed in a way that could create problems for anyone using it or your own highly confidential materials leaking out to the public. Just recently Apple banned the use of ChatGPT and Github Copilot to prevent such leaks. Also, besides corporate secrets, sending any personal data to these online services should be avoided - for now.', 'Because of this specific controversy, we are very careful to introduce these generative AI tools into the daily project work and always go through the potential risks with our Clients before making the decision to enable them for the dev teams.', 'On the other hand, the work required to train these large language models can be ethically questionable and exploitative. This is the darker side that the public rarely sees, but should be taken seriously to produce services which are both innovative and ethical. While moving fast and breaking things, the companies developing these highly interesting solutions should also pause every now and then to fix the basic things powering their growth.', 'What comes to regulatory developments in the field, the speed of new services popping up is so fast that the legal side will be far behind for a long time (and might never truly catch up). The most interesting (or worrying) discussion to follow in the European Union is a recent legislation proposal which could outright ban the use of non-EU services and be a major blow also to open source developers. This would surely be a very big thing and hopefully some better alternative legislation will be introduced to enable innovations to thrive across the globe - with privacy matters taken seriously.', 'With announcements from Microsoft and Google to bring these generative AI tools as core parts to all of their offerings, it currently seems inevitable that whether you like it or not, these technologies are here to stay and will become part of many people‚Äôs daily work. Limiting their use in some geographical areas would surely put different companies in very different positions in terms of competitiveness.', 'As said in many places around the world already, it is not AI that is going to take your job, but it will be taken by someone who knows how to leverage AI and become more productive.', 'So, embrace the change and buckle up, you could be seeing some interesting developments in the (near) future.']",[]
https://futurice.com/blog/gocurrency,Gocurrency,22 May 2023,Technology,Discover how Go's lightweight Goroutines and built-in channels enable safe and efficient concurrency. Improve performance and scalability with Go Concurrency.,"['Concurrency', 'Goroutines & Channels in Go', 'Goroutine in practice', 'Channels', 'Benefits of Goroutines/Channels', 'Go Concurrency Patterns', 'Reading channels with for range', 'Working with select statement', 'WaitGroups', 'Mutexes']","[""How to get started with Golang's Concurrency, how it works, and why it does do the way it does? In this topic breakdown, I will have a look at concurrency and how Golang uniquely approaches this topic with examples."", 'Concurrency refers to the ability of a computer system to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In modern software development, Concurrency is essential because it allows programs to handle multiple user requests, perform background tasks, and process data in parallel, resulting in faster and more efficient processing.', 'Go is well-suited for Concurrency because of its lightweight Goroutines and built-in Channel type. Goroutines are lightweight threads that can be created easily and have low overhead, allowing for the efficient creation of thousands or even millions of concurrent processes. Channels are built-in data structures that facilitate communication between Goroutines, enabling safe and efficient synchronization of data access.', 'Above is a snippet of how to create a Channel that accepts the string primitive and is initialized with an initial buffer capacity of 10, if you omit or provide 0 the channel would be unbuffered.', 'In Go, Channels are used to communicate and synchronize data between Goroutines. When you create a Channel, you have the option to specify its buffer capacity. The buffer capacity determines how many values can be stored in the Channel before it blocks, meaning the sender has to wait for the receiver to read from the Channel before it can send another value.', 'If you specify a buffer capacity of zero or omit the buffer size when creating the Channel, the Channel becomes unbuffered. An unbuffered channel can only hold one value at a time. When a sender sends a value to an unbuffered channel, it blocks until a receiver reads the value from the Channel. Similarly, when a receiver reads from an unbuffered channel, it blocks until a sender sends a value to the Channel.', 'In other words, an unbuffered channel ensures that both the sender and the receiver are ready and available to communicate with each other at the time of communication. This ensures that the values are synchronized and exchanged in a safe and synchronized manner.', 'On the other hand, if you specify a buffer capacity greater than zero, the channel becomes buffered. A buffered channel can hold multiple values, up to its buffer capacity. When a sender sends a value to a buffered channel, it will not block as long as the buffer is not full. Similarly, when a receiver reads from a buffered channel, it will not block as long as the buffer is not empty. This can lead to increased performance and reduced contention in some cases, but it also introduces potential risks of data races and synchronization issues when multiple Goroutines are trying to access the same channel.', 'The basic idea behind Go Concurrency is that each Goroutine performs a small, well-defined task, and channels are used to coordinate their activities. This allows programs to be written in a way that maximizes parallelism and minimizes contention, resulting in faster and more efficient processing.', 'A Goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution that is managed by the Go runtime. They are different from traditional threads in that they are designed to be concurrent, which means they allow multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously and independently. Goroutines are much lighter than traditional threads, as they require only a few kilobytes of memory compared to several megabytes of memory required by traditional threads. Goroutines are also more cost-effective than traditional threads, as creating and managing them is much cheaper. Furthermore, Goroutines communicate through channels, which are built-in data structures that enable safe and efficient synchronization of data access.', 'In the example above we can see that spinning up a new Goroutine is as easy as adding the go keyword in front of a function. What happens is given that race(car1) and race(car2) are on different Goroutines, they run independently of one another, the sleep timer for 5 seconds is in place to wait for two Goroutines which now takes a combined time of 5 seconds to execute given that each iteration waits for 1 second and runs 5 times. If the two race calls were not on their own Goroutines, the code would have taken a whopping 10s to execute.', 'Note: the BuildRace function is a goroutine of its own.', 'A Channel is a built-in data structure that allows Goroutines to communicate and synchronize their activities. Channels provide a way to send and receive values between Goroutines in a safe and efficient way, without the need for locks or other synchronization primitives.', 'Channels can be used to communicate between Goroutines by sending and receiving values. The <- operator is used to send and receive values on a channel. For example, to send a value on a channel, you would write channel <- value. To receive a value from a Channel, you would write value := <-channel.', 'In this example, we create a channel of type int using the make function. We then start a Goroutine that sends the value 82 on the channel using the c <- 82 syntax. Finally, we receive the value from the channel using the value := <-c syntax.', ""When you run this program, you'll see that the value 82 is received from the channel and printed to the console."", 'Buffered Channels', 'In the example above, we instantiate a channel with a buffer capacity of 2 and what this means is that the channel can receive two strings in the case above before requiring that a read operation is done on the channel to free up space. We write twice to the channel and then close the channel and this was done to let anything reading from the channel know when to stop attempting a read this is the only way fmt.Println(""All cars have finished the race!"") would be reached because it can only be reached if we break out of the for loop. We sleep for 6 seconds to allow for the read operation to fully occur.', 'In the example, rather than receive the value and an open bool value, we let range handle retrieving the value and internally checking to see if the channel is open, since we close the channel, after the second value is read the result would look like', 'A select statement lets a Goroutine wait on multiple communication operations, it blocks operation until at least one of its cases can run, and it executes that case, if multiple cases can run at the same time, it chooses one at random.', ""Let's break this down, we created two channels for the two different cars and modified the addCar function to include a channel. The addCarWithChan and the startRaceWithSelect function are in their own goroutines and would run concurrently until the channel is closed or the wait time is reached. An example of the result is as follows:"", 'This might look a bit strange as how is Ferrari racing(5th line) without being added to the race first and what happened to the line ""All cars have finished the race!"". First off given that addCarWithChan function pushes the value to the channel before printing to screen means that startRaceWithSelect function which is also running concurrently can read that value even before the next line is printed, remember select is blocking which means that once it\'s picked up, everything in the case block must be executed before the next operation occurs. As for the line ""All cars have finished the race!"" the timer simply exhausted the 5 seconds before the entire operation could be completed.', 'A WaitGroup is a synchronization mechanism that allows a program to wait for a collection of Goroutines to finish executing before proceeding to the next step in the program.', 'A WaitGroup maintains a counter that is incremented by each Goroutine that is launched and decremented by each Goroutine that finishes. The program waits for the counter to reach zero, indicating that all goroutines have been completed, before proceeding to the next step.', 'The WaitGroup type provides three methods:', 'Wait(): Blocks the program until the WaitGroup counter is zero.', '  package gocurrency\nimport (\n""fmt""\n""sync""\n""time""\n)\nfunc SimpleWaitGroup() {\nvar wg sync.WaitGroup\nfor i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {\nwg.Add(1) // increment WaitGroup counter\ngo func(num int) {\n  defer wg.Done() // decrement WaitGroup counter when done\n  fmt.Printf(""goroutine %d\\n"", num)\n}(i)\ntime.Sleep(time.Duration(1 * time.Second))\n}\nwg.Wait() // blocks until WaitGroup counter is zero\nfmt.Println(""All goroutines have finished executing."")\n    }', 'In this example, wg.Wait() blocks the function from proceeding to ""All goroutines have finished executing."" until all the added wait groups are done.', 'Mutexes are a powerful synchronization mechanism that can be used to protect shared resources in concurrent programs.', 'Imagine that you are organizing a car race with multiple cars that will be running simultaneously on a track. You need to ensure that the cars do not collide with each other and that they stay within their lanes.\nTo achieve this, you can use a mutex to protect the shared resource, which in this case is the track. The mutex will allow only one car to access the track at a time, ensuring that no two cars collide with each other.', 'In this example, we have a shared resource, which is the track represented as an array of integers. Each element of the array represents the number of laps completed by a particular car. We also have a mutex, trackMutex, which we use to protect the shared resource.', 'The main function creates a WaitGroup and launches three Goroutines, each representing a car in the race. The Add() method is used to increment the WaitGroup counter by one before launching each Goroutine.', 'Inside each Goroutine, a loop is executed five times, representing five laps around the track. The Goroutine first acquires the lock on the mutex by calling Lock(), ensuring that only one Goroutine can access the shared resource at a time. It then updates the lap count for its corresponding car and prints a message indicating which car is on which lap. Finally, the Goroutine releases the lock on the mutex by calling Unlock(), allowing other Goroutines to access the shared resource.', 'The main function waits for all three Goroutines to finish executing by calling wg.Wait().', ""I hope that this blog will get you started with Golang's Concurrency, helped to explain how it works, and why it does the way it does.

Unlike traditional thread synchronization mechanisms like locks and semaphores, Goroutines can be synchronized using channels, which are simpler and more intuitive to use.

SDVs, underpinned by advanced software and computing technology, use centralised domain control units to manage different vehicle systems and components. Features and functions are primarily enabled through software, making it possible to customise, personalise and enhance the driving experience for users.', 'While connected vehicles have existed since the late 1960‚Äôs, Tesla has been the driving force behind a paradigm shift. Tesla, along with other new entrants like NIO, XPENG and RIVIAN have designed their vehicles with a heavy emphasis on software from the outset. This approach allows for over-the-air (OTA) updates that improve vehicle functionality post-purchase. Traditional OEMs, however, are struggling to adapt multiple platforms and models to SDVs. Renault Group, Stellantis, or Volvo Cars rely on third-party solutions provided by Amazon or Google, while Mercedes-Benz AG, Volkswagen, or Hyundai prefer in-house developed car.OS stacks.', 'So, what sets SDVs apart from the electrical/electronic (E/E) systems of the past? I‚Äôd say there are five key differences:', 'The hardware layer of SDVs typically includes an in-car infotainment computer, an Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) computer, exterior and interior controllers, a central driving controller, and a connectivity module. An embedded software layer manages everything, including general operations, SDKs, and APIs, based on the hardware layer.', 'OEMs either develop their own application layers or collaborate with hyperscalers like Google or Amazon.

SDVs are not just vehicles, but platforms for connectivity, data generation, personalization, and even monetization."", ""They also promise to have far-reaching impacts beyond the automotive sector, influencing public transportation, city planning, the energy sector, and more. Yet, as we hurtle towards this exciting future, many questions remain. Are consumers ready to embrace this shift? How will regulations keep pace with these rapid advancements? And crucially, in a world where your car is not just a car, but a 'computer on wheels', who will take the driver's seat - the traditional automakers, or the tech giants?"", 'What is your perspective on the future of mobility in the age of Software Defined Vehicles?']","[""Older connected vehicles used numerous disconnected electronic control units (ECUs) to control various functions, such as in-car entertainment, engine controls, and route planning. These systems were not designed for software and functional updates throughout the vehicle's lifetime. In contrast, SDVs adopt a more integrated approach, using powerful domain controllers to run multiple functions. All connected systems in SDVs operate within a single, unified stack, with a common language that facilitates seamless interoperability."", ""SDVs also utilise connectivity in ways traditional E/E systems couldn't. Designed to connect to the internet, other vehicles, infrastructure, and more, SDVs generate, collect, and analyse vast amounts of data for applications like predictive maintenance, personalised experiences, and autonomous driving."", ""E/E systems were primarily hardware-driven, with software playing a secondary role. In SDVs, software is at the forefront, defining the vehicle's features and capabilities. Unlike traditional E/E systems, SDVs can receive software updates over-the-air. This allows for continuous improvement and feature enhancements, extending the vehicle's lifecycle and enhancing user experience."", ""While E/E systems typically operate on an individual component basis, SDVs use a service-oriented architecture (SOA) model. This allows different software applications to reuse services, leading to increased efficiency and flexibility in the vehicle's system design and operation."", 'The hardware layer of SDVs typically includes an in-car infotainment computer, an Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) computer, exterior and interior controllers, a central driving controller, and a connectivity module. An embedded software layer manages everything, including general operations, SDKs, and APIs, based on the hardware layer.OEMs either develop their own application layers or collaborate with hyperscalers like Google or Amazon. Brands often design the UI to create a unique experience, and a cloud solution connects to the SDV for data collection, processing, and analytics, paving the way for new use cases and business models.']"

Too much information is a problem for the human brain ‚Äì the overload makes us blind. Using only machines to gather and analyze data can create outputs that are difficult to communicate or make no sense. That‚Äôs why combining machine- and human-based data analytics is crucial. This helps avoid bias both in algorithms and conclusions.', 'Think about the areas where your business strategy and its execution need to be adaptive. What are the business-critical things that need to be illuminated with (almost) real-time data? In an optimal world, what information do people need to make good decisions in their everyday jobs? What kind of leading vs. lagging indicators could be identified based on alternative external data? Some areas will always lack data or require too much effort to research with scientific methods ‚Äì in these cases, creating hypotheses, and then testing and validating them is a solid way of gathering information.', 'We all make hundreds of decisions of varying size each day. But what do we base those decisions on? Data literacy is needed across the entire organisation. Co-adaptive strategic and operational decision making calls for structures, roles and ways of working that enable you to react fast when the data shows a need for adaptation. Transparency, the availability of data, and strategic thinking are necessary for better decision-making at all levels.', 'Think about decision making in your organization.

To look ahead and prepare for the future, we need to imagine possible development paths. Thinking about possible futures can be supported with data-led forecast tools, but that alone is not enough. Provide space and nourishment for creative minds.', 'Adaptivity is not about jumping onto a new path each week. Data is used to enrich scenarios built on futures thinking, and to evaluate which ones are most likely to happen. Dialogue is needed to make conclusions on whether a change signal is just a temporary variation or a sign of a permanent phenomenon. When forming hypotheses, it‚Äôs important to differentiate between information and beliefs. Bets are made to focus development efforts ‚Äì and constantly validated. This is called the DIBB framework ‚Äì short for data-insight-belief-bet.', 'Focusing too much on data runs the risk of people becoming fixed into a problem solving mindset, which can become a strong bias in and of itself.

That makes it difficult to think about positive scenarios and be innovative.', 'A core development area for many organizations is to overcome the fear of failure.', 'Quality and speed can rarely be reached at the same time.

Dialogue creates shared understanding and focus.', 'Secondly, engagement is needed to create motivation and commitment. Adaptivity requires that people understand their shared direction, are empowered to make data-enabled decisions in their daily work, and they are motivated and committed to taking the necessary action. Engaged people will become advocates for your strategy, and pull other people along with them. This is crucial for faster strategy execution.', 'There are many different ways to enhance engagement ‚Äì I call these levels of participation. Effective organizations use a suitable level in each situation, it‚Äôs an elemental part of their leadership culture and ways of working together.', 'The human mind likes patterns and unity. We desire to execute strategy so that everyone walks toward the same goal in unison, at all levels. We talk about aligning our actions, going from local variations towards centralized planning and a globally productized offering. It is important to consider the level at which alignment is needed, and how strong it should be.', 'It is both a matter of organizational culture as well as business model: are we optimizing products to fit the needs of a wider customer base, just doing light customization, or should our offering be unique for each customer. Even in service business that consists of unique projects, there are similarities that can form modules of products. These can be implemented repeatedly with greater efficiency if best practices are shared, well documented and used over and over again. Alignment enables efficiency, but at the same time, too much alignment tends to blur the complex nature of large projects or ecosystems ‚Äì only having a hammer at hand makes you see nothing but nails around you.', 'Innovation stems from individuals breaking the rules. When people don‚Äôt behave as before, they create variations or create something new, sowing the seeds for fruitful innovation. Think about how to make that more systematic. How to help people spot and share insights about new customer needs? How to turn single variations into systematic testing of what works and what new services and products there could be?', 'Adaptive organizations are able to balance alignment and innovation. Keep your shared focus clear and give as much autonomy as you can. Build a culture of honest communication, trust, transparency and constant dialogue so that people connect with each other and don‚Äôt self-direct to chaos. You‚Äôll need practices that guide all the flocks toward the same destination. You can always use technology to track the level of alignment, but it won‚Äôt replace dialogue.', 'Successful adaptation is about timely implementation of decisions.', 'In strategy work, the implementation part is often seen as the most difficult one. ‚ÄúIt takes two years before we can get the message through,‚Äù said the strategy director of one large Finnish corporation. With the abovementioned co-adaptive capabilities, you can speed up the implementation of new change initiatives, projects, and ideas.', 'Some people are action-oriented, some people focus on creating and fine-tuning ideas, and others can‚Äôt move ahead before they are sure that the right problem is being addressed.

At Futurice, we‚Äôre big fans of Brad Frost‚Äôs Atomic Design methodology, because of its intuitive approach to organising assets across design and tech, and its focus on scalability.', ""The Atomic Design methodology is inspired by the composition of matter in chemistry. The approach uses Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms to categorise and group design elements of varying complexity. This might sound a bit complicated at first but, in practice, it's a logical and simple method for creating clear hierarchy and order within a modular Pattern Library."", '', 'Benefits of Atomic Design methodology include:', 'You don‚Äôt have to stick with the Atomic Design naming conventions of Atoms, Molecules, Organisms ‚Äì you can use whatever terminology works best for your team. Brad Frost sums this up best:', '‚ÄúAtomic design‚Äù as a buzzword encapsulates the concepts of modular design and development, which becomes a useful shorthand for convincing stakeholders and talking with colleagues. But atomic design is not rigid dogma. Ultimately, whatever taxonomy you choose to work with should help you and your organisation communicate more effectively in order to craft an amazing UI Design System.', '-- Brad Frost, creator of the Atomic Design methodology', '', ""Before starting to populate your Pattern Library, it's useful to define what elements need to live in it. We've already looked at the differences and overlaps between Style Guides, Pattern Libraries and Design Systems, and we've discussed the value of creating a Pattern Library that has the potential to scale into a future Design System."", ""The following activity is a simple way for a team to visualise the elements that are essential to include in their organisation's Pattern Library. Once these elements have been identified, you can begin to think about the groupings and structure within your fledgling Pattern Library."", 'Use our pre-built Miro canvases to get started ‚Äì follow this link.', '', '', 'When including components in this activity you can either work at a macro level (Small, Medium, Large components), or at a micro level (buttons, products cards, footer navigation).', '', 'In order to set up a Pattern Library that works for your product(s), you‚Äôll need to make sure to map the patterns you‚Äôre currently using. The following exercise has the added benefit of identifying variations and inconsistencies in how the same or similar patterns get used.', 'All you need to do is grab screenshots from across your product(s) and place them on the Miro canvas. Since you‚Äôve already done the work to identify what to include in your library, go ahead and match your screenshots with their respective elements.', '', 'At the end of this exercise, you should have all the components and styles (and groups of components and styles) on the canvas. If you‚Äôre auditing a fairly mature product, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll see visual variations in variants of the same type of component, that manifest as differences in size, spacing, colour, etc. You‚Äôll need to assess whether they should be merged or be considered a different, unique component type. Similarly, you might identify colour variables that differ ever so slightly from one another which will need to be merged (this usually happens with greys, for some reason).', '', 'As your Pattern Library is a cross-discipline tool, it‚Äôs essential to ensure that everyone who‚Äôs using and contributing to the library is also using the same lingo. A good starting point is aligning on which naming convention works best for the team across design and tech.', 'When it comes to naming individual components, designers and developers should simply agree on the clearest name for a component. In Atomic Design, this starts to become more subjective when naming components that are Molecules or Organisms, especially those that are created specifically for your product. Try to keep naming aligned to established conventions where possible, otherwise just try to keep component names descriptive and logical for your team.\nOther elements of the Pattern Library that benefit from having their naming conventions discussed and defined with your team include:', 'Use the canvas below to explore naming conventions with your cross-functional Pattern Library team, and align on an approach that makes sense to everyone, before getting into your design tools.', '', 'Use our pre-built Miro canvases to get started ‚Äì follow this link.', '', '', ""You can mix and match naming conventions across elements of your workflow if it's easier to do so. For example, it might make sense for your team to use ‚ÄòTitle Case‚Äô for File names, with ‚ÄòcamelCase‚Äô used for components."", '', ""Now that you've identified the elements that need to live in your Pattern Library, and selected naming conventions and a methodology for organising those elements, you can start to plan the structure of your Pattern Library."", ""Let's assume you've chosen to use the Atomic Design methodology. You can now start to group and organise the elements you defined in the ‚ÄòWhat goes in‚Äô exercise following Atomic Design principles. In the example below, you can see how we've created top-level content groups following Atomic Design principles, and begun to group our Library elements under each category. If you're using Figma, these top-level Categories will become Pages, with the elements below each organised onto the frames within these pages. You might have noticed how we've included numbers next to our top-level Categories; this helps our Categories to appear in design tool menus in the order that we choose, rather than in alphabetical order based on the Category names."", '', '', '', 'We want to create a Library that achieves an unambiguous experience when working with the components, where users of the Library spend less time guessing and more time building flows, but it can become unwieldy, too.', 'Tools like Figma give us the ability to give components properties that represent styling and content variations, this reduces the need to use manual overrides that weren‚Äôt intended and could lead to inconsistencies. But remember to ask, how much guidance is too much guidance? There‚Äôs a point at which a component‚Äôs variations become too complex to keep track of and even reduce the efficiency benefits of using variants in the first place.', '', 'Lets say, for example, that your organisation has a web platform and an iOS app; how should you consider these different platforms when planning your Pattern Library?', 'We recommend considering a multi-platform approach that caters to projects built on different code bases.

Designers will be accountable for ensuring that a button component in the iOS app looks like a button component on the web platform, while the Global Style Guide will help to ensure cross-platform brand consistency.', 'So how does the Global Style Guide work?\nThe purpose of the Global Style Guide is to ensure that fundamental stylistic elements stay consistent across the wider product ecosystem. It‚Äôs essentially the Style Guide part of a single Pattern Library separated out into its own file in order to cascade stylistic elements across platform-specific libraries. Meanwhile, the product-specific libraries house actual components. The Global Style Guide should be focused on the following stylistic elements:', '', '', 'Once a team has gone to the effort of putting together a robust, well-structured Pattern Library, it‚Äôs essential that they put in place some clear processes and guidance to ensure that collaborators understand how to use, contribute to, and scale the Library. This is where governance comes into play. Without good governance, your shiny new Pattern Library can quickly deteriorate into a mess of inconsistencies and duplication that will gradually chip away at the Library‚Äôs value.', ""When we discuss governance in the context of Pattern Libraries, what we‚Äôre talking about is creating a framework that outlines roles, responsibilities and decision-making for maintaining and updating a product's Pattern Library."", '', 'The specific roles and responsibilities required for your Pattern Library Team will vary, depending on the size and complexity of your Pattern Library and of your organisation.

They will also be the ones merging and releasing updates in Figma, or any other tool your team uses, that follow the standards and quality that the team has decided previously.', ""Library Design Owners also need to keep track of how well the Library is performing. This means following up on how well the Library fits the team's workflows and its adoption."", '', 'As the name suggests, the Library Engineer Owner is usually a developer that is in charge of the coded front end components.

Here he reflects on nine things that make him happy, from intellectual curiosity to a bellyful of good food.', 'I‚Äôm a very curious person so it‚Äôs no wonder I‚Äôve worked in multiple areas, including industrial design, media, computer science and now business design. When I look at an unfamiliar field, I see a black box and want to get to its core and understand an aspect of the world that was previously hidden to me. I‚Äôm always happy when there is one less black box in the world ‚Äì and there are always more to find, which is also a great thing.', 'I don‚Äôt really like small talk ‚Äì you won‚Äôt find me chatting for half an hour about soccer or the weather. Instead, I really appreciate conversations where I find something in common with someone and we can just walk around the topic and wonder how many other perspectives there are out there. Expanding my understanding makes me happy ‚Äì in terms of equality, many of us don‚Äôt realize how privileged we are so it‚Äôs great to learn how other people see the world. As designers, we really benefit from doing this, and it‚Äôs very important to do so ‚Äì we‚Äôre a community and we don‚Äôt just learn or design for ourselves.', 'Throughout my career I‚Äôve benefited from understanding different areas ‚Äì for example, when I was doing UX design with strict technical limitations I benefited a lot from my understanding of computer science. Being able to speak the same language as the developer on the client side helps you understand the context and create a solution that really serves their needs.', 'As a designer, it‚Äôs no surprise that I appreciate beautiful things. Design is the combination of aesthetics and function ‚Äì it‚Äôs often beauty that initially draws people towards a career in this field. This can make perfectionism a challenge, but I‚Äôve learned to work quickly while making beautiful solutions for clients. That said, in my own time I can still occasionally drive myself crazy, like when I look at 300 different options just to choose the perfect tennis racket!', 'I can be very competitive and while I don‚Äôt ever take it too far, it‚Äôs always a good feeling to win. I play basketball once a week, padel when it‚Äôs warm enough and play table football whenever I can. We don‚Äôt have a table at the Munich office but there is one in Berlin ‚Äì if I worked there I‚Äôd play it every day! I also always have the drive to win if I‚Äôm involved in a competition, like creating business models or products in hackathons and makeathons. It‚Äôs the same in client pitches and even when creating a solution ‚Äì I‚Äôm not necessarily competing with others, sometimes I‚Äôm competing with the problem. Overcoming complex challenges is a great feeling.', 'This is something that makes me really happy ‚Äì in fact, it‚Äôs my favorite thing to do in my own time. I wouldn‚Äôt want to get an instructor‚Äôs license and do it full time, but it‚Äôs a special feeling and one of the few things that put me completely in the moment, away from any distracting thoughts. When I don‚Äôt have scuba as an option I can always meditate, but for me there‚Äôs nothing like the fully immersive feeling of diving ‚Äì it‚Äôs like flying underwater. It‚Äôs the best feeling in the world.', 'Everyone needs balance in their life. I‚Äôm working in an intellectual profession, using my mind more than my body, so it‚Äôs good to get back into a workshop and physically work on something tangible like a bicycle or furniture. This is something I enjoyed about industrial design ‚Äì being in the workshop and able to create anything my imagination and skill level made possible. If an intellectual challenge is making your head spin at work, it‚Äôs nice to come home and indulge in an activity that doesn‚Äôt involve so much mental effort.', 'This is another hobby of mine ‚Äì it‚Äôs a nice change to taking pictures with my cell phone. I like the constraint of only having 36 shots on the roll ‚Äì each picture costs around a euro, so you have to value each shot and put the effort in, then you get rewarded once they‚Äôre developed. I never fill the whole roll in one day, so it‚Äôs like a bag of surprises when I hand it in ‚Äì there might be photos from a party, a walk somewhere beautiful, a vacation or something else. I always shoot in black and white and it makes me happy seeing beautiful shots of our world.', '\nCaption: Dare to jump into cold water ‚Äì it‚Äôs less cold than you‚Äôd think!

This calls for a co-adaptive approach to strategy that connects data and people. In this article I‚Äôll explain what it is, and how you can build your adaptation capabilities.', 'Today‚Äôs business success is not made with the best strategy ‚Äì instead, it is enabled by the fastest implementation and adaptation. This requires real-time information and appropriately timed decisions.', 'At Futurice, we‚Äôve recognised that relying solely on ‚Äúrelevant data‚Äù is not enough. You cannot afford to miss the first-hand experiences of your frontline employees, as they have valuable insights. The true value of gathering information from different sources is only created through dialogue with people. And people need to be engaged and empowered to act in time. We call this approach co-adaptive strategy. How is it different from what you might be used to?', 'There are three traditional approaches to forming and executing a strategy, whether it is a business, product or sales strategy.', '‚ÄúCarpenters should focus on their work, not strategy.‚Äù', 'In this approach, only one or few individuals do the strategic thinking, and they might not even share the strategy with their employees. Strategy is executed by defining roles for people and telling them what they need to do.', '‚ÄúWe formulate a strategy and then hope for the best.‚Äù', 'In this top-down approach, the strategy is created by a small group of directors, often with the help of external consultants who have strong domain expertise to conduct research.', '‚ÄúWe believe (only) in our own employees.‚Äù', 'A bottom-up approach where the strategy is crafted together with employees, as well as key clients and stakeholders. Facilitators get people to discuss choices and decisions together. This approach is sometimes also referred to as open strategy', 'The most typical of these approaches ‚Äì analytical research ‚Äì worked well in the past when the world was more predictable and corporations were more analog than today. Now, digitalization and data are transforming all organizations. This also creates a need for organizations to rethink strategy processes, and the forerunners are already doing that.', 'In addition to the three traditional approaches, there is a fourth one: co-adaptive strategy. It is a data-enabled and co-created strategy process that is all about having constant dialogue, experimenting and scaling what works.', 'We call this approach co-adaptive because a constant stream of data alone isn‚Äôt enough ‚Äì you‚Äôll need collaboration and engagement as well. The big difference to the traditional approaches is that in this approach, strategy formulation and execution are not two separated phases but a constant loop. The co-adaptive approach runs at a much faster clock speed.', 'The value of co-adaptive strategy lies in speeding up learning ‚Äì testing hypotheses about markets and customer needs, experimenting to find out what works, and so on. Early failures are valuable. The transformation doesn‚Äôt just apply to a few projects, it‚Äôs about building a culture of constant improvement and data-enabled adjustment, and establishing a growth mindset across the whole organization.', 'Previously it was important that a company strategy is based on gaining sustainable competitive advantage, differentiating from the competition. Long term north star is still needed, but how to get there can not be fixed for the next five years.', 'Lean startups already create and test their strategic hypotheses at a fast pace in order to find the right focus for growing their business.

We have sought to articulate and explore this idea across previous blog entries.', 'So far in our series, we‚Äôve explored the meaning of the core ecosystem concept and explained why a forensic focus on customers is key to making them work. In this blog, we pinpoint where the magic happens. Where does the electricity of ecosystems, as a model, come from? And how can this be used to supercharge a company, placing it at the heart of radical transformation?', 'To answer these questions, let‚Äôs imagine a fictitious healthcare company called JRS (Joint Replacement Solutions). A seasoned player, JRS provides knee, hip and other joint replacement implants to an extensive network of private and public hospitals.', 'JRS has a strong track record, but ‚Äì like most organizations ‚Äì its business model is under constant threat from established and emerging competitors seeking to provide similar baseline services more quickly or cheaply or using different operational tech. To counter these challenges and build on its strengths, JRS needs to complement its legacy capabilities by providing a digital platform and enabling a digital ecosystem that supports customers and healthcare practitioners across every stage of their joint replacement journey.', 'Shifting the lens from product to platform aligns perfectly with current opportunities in the Medtech climate for two reasons. Firstly, the powerful trend towards an agile startup mentality within companies is moving the emphasis away from traditional linear models. Secondly, there is a paradigm shift in connectivity ‚Äì how patients interact with any healthcare ecosystem. According to a Statista survey, there will be over 75 billion IoT-enabled devices by 2025. In addition, ever-improving transmission standards are leading us into the age of Massive IoT (MIoT). This creates new business models based around data and connectivity. Embrace these factors, and JRS can dramatically expand its core purpose ‚Äì as long as it adheres to the following principles:', 'Patients are the heartbeat of the ecosystem model, the focal point around which all else orbits. For example, patients who require a transplant will interact with several healthcare providers using multiple touchpoints and data sources. Preoperative prep, the procedure itself, rehab and recovery will feature various healthcare professionals. Across thousands of patients, hospitals and rehab facilities, these interactions play out in myriad ways. Throughout it all, the decisive interchanges occur between patients and healthcare providers. From a tech point of view, the interoperability of platforms, tools and systems to try and capture these interactions and boost connectivity remains an ongoing challenge within healthcare and one that everyone is trying to resolve.', 'Our Medtech company, JRS, has an opening to use the ecosystems model to zero in on these interactions and address interoperability to make the healthcare journey as seamless and easy as possible for patients and HCPs. In practice, JRS can use ecosystem thinking to shift from being a joint transplant implant supplier to becoming a full-service, API-driven digital platform that services patients‚Äô end-to-end needs from the start to the end of their medical experience. This could include making the patient journey more convenient and less stressful through the automated booking of all their transplant appointments. It could also involve providing personalized patient information based on their diagnosis or a service that translates medical terminology into everyday language.', 'If patients are the heartbeat of ecosystems, then data and insights are the oxygen. Better quality health data and insights helps healthcare providers provide more personalized, integrated care, empowers patients to be more health literate and supports research organizations to develop new treatments.\nFor JRS to use the ecosystem model to reinvent itself as a platform, it needs access to excellent quality, real-time patient data. Data powers ecosystems and provides the foundation for a robust but adaptable model that can be developed and scaled over time.', ""Data scientists know that it takes time and effort to clean and collate data which is a significant investment; however, JRS has a lot of information through its linear business. In addition, JRS's purpose-built and well-maintained decentralized data lakes and warehouses provide all the actionable insights required along the patient journey. JRS will realize that this investment was worthwhile when it builds on these actionable insights to meet its objectives. These include using insights to identify those patient interactions that can be enhanced and improved, speeding up treatment and offering a more seamless rehab transition, and ensuring aftercare that preempts future issues."", 'This last point reinforces the power of data-enabled ecosystems. For example, a patient could report post-operative problems to JRS‚Äôs central platform in real-time, allowing HCPs to address the issues before they spiral out of control. Combined with data directly from the operating theater, it becomes possible to forge a preventative framework that keeps patients healthy in the long-run; while reducing the pressures that can lead to backlogs, bottlenecks and systemic collapse.', ""The word disruption is often associated with game-changing digital transformations. But a key benefit of ecosystems is that they don't necessarily require an overhaul of the existing business model. By putting customer interactions under the microscope to build actionable insights, companies that feel trapped by their legacy business can discover ways to create value. Emphasizing value will give our fictional joint replacement expert, JRS, a competitive advantage within the healthcare ecosystem by using its data to help make all the experiences and products in its ecosystem better over time. This is good news for patients, but doctors and hospital departments will also feel its effect. Healthcare professionals will realize that the JRS digital platform addresses pain points they encounter in helping orthopedic patients return to full health. What‚Äôs more, it does so in a way that integrates with their workflow. As a result, it won't require additional effort or legwork in an already pressurized setting."", 'Circularity gets to the core point of ecosystem thinking. Ecosystems are not just about unlocking value and extending the shelf life of the core business; they also deliver a multiplier effect that benefits customers, operators, and society at large. They are inherently circular, reciprocal and to the benefit of all.', 'Suppose JRS builds a digital platform that tracks all customer interactions during the knee/hip transplant process. As a result, it can quickly identify actionable insights that will provide early warning of possible complications and support rapid improvements and enhancements. This gives the company a competitive edge by reaching beyond the straightforward provision of services, becoming a critical mainstay of healthcare ecosystem efficiencies and satisfaction.', 'At the same time, patients emerge better off because their needs are closely monitored and addressed. And healthcare professionals can deliver their goal of healthy patients more fluidly and sustainably.', ""In addition, other key players in the JRS ecosystem can optimize the model to create better implants, surgery materials or operation times. As a result, issues are flagged more quickly, the system is more responsive, and everyone is better equipped to reap value at each new turn. (We will explore the role of JRS's ecosystem partners in our next blog)."", 'In sum, the ecosystem speaks directly to patients, HCPs and the challenges they encounter, making it easier to provide optimal outcomes at any given time.']",[]

It's a conclusion I have come to through my environmental activism work that I do outside of work and the future foresight work that I do in design. People often imagine the future away and in front of them but we are co-designing the future everyday, in every moment through the way we relate to each other, the things we do now and bringing something else to life. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the possibilities of the future and not focus on being present and what‚Äôs happening in the present.

I would recommend learning about people, sociology and psychology. So much of this work is about relating to people, understanding different points of view or learning to emphasise with different points of view and translating that into something strategic.

https://futurice.com/blog/playful-design,Playful design supports both creativity and innovation,20 Feb 2023,Ways of Working,"Play fosters creativity and generates enthusiasm for new ideas. In business, playfulness can be a crucial design approach to develop great innovation.","['What is playful design?', 'What benefits do playful products have?', 'How playfulness can support your business']","[""Did you know that fun and play can have a positive impact on messy design processes? Or that playful products are better at meeting user needs? The most important ingredient in design work is creativity, and when fun and play are involved, we are much more creative, we enjoy our work more and we are able to design better and more playful products. For this excellent reason, I'd like to introduce you to a secret weapon called playful design. "", 'On the one hand, playful design is a methodology in which playful elements are incorporated into the design process, and on the other hand, playful design is a design outcome that has playful elements for the users. In other words, playful design supports both the design process and the outcome.', 'Let me start with the playful design process. As far back as 1795 the poet and philosopher Friedrich Schiller noticed the playful nature of people as an integral part of their behavior. He argued that we only fulfill our potential as human beings when we play \n1*. Much later on, the term ‚Äúhomo ludens‚Äù has been established in social sciences, describing the scientific examination of play in a cultural context. Play amuses us while also being a part of our behavior, and it can be found in all cultures around the world. \n2*. Playful behavior is particularly evident in children around the world. Children play to learn, to communicate, and to create. And this is exactly what we do every day as designers.', '(*refer to the sources at the end)', 'In my doctoral dissertation, I found out that play is an essential factor in positively influencing the design process in highly innovative companies. Play creates an atmosphere that helps to encourage creative behavior. With a sense of humor, ideas are not taken too seriously and the members of an organization are less afraid to express their ideas. Sometimes humor and laughter can help move toward a solution to difficult problems: They make criticism not feel like criticism at first glance, and encourage presenting ideas that may be implemented at a later date. Laughing or smiling frees designers from these restrictions, and by extension, supports the generation of incongruities and ideas. The opportunity to laugh and joke around enables designers to reduce tensions rather than just focus on success, and to offer space for creative and unconventional solutions.', ""Our four values ‚Äì care, trust, transparency and continuous improvement ‚Äì help us create an atmosphere where we can be authentic and humorous. We have many meetings and breaks, which provides a more relaxed and fun atmosphere. There is hardly a design meeting without laughter. Especially during brainstorming sessions, we talk about our ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô ideas and solutions. We play around a little and don't take ourselves too seriously. Fun is part of our daily way of working."", 'CEO and Chief Designer Oki Sato explains the importance of fun quite well in this GQ interview:', '‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always about solving problems in a very pleasant, fun way. (‚Ä¶) Of course function is important but in the end it‚Äôs always about emotions‚Äù', 'The other aspect of playful design is the playfulness of the outcome of design. The basic idea is that users have fun while using our solution. They solve their problems and satisfy their needs while playing with our product. From this perspective, playful design is very similar to gamification, yet it uses the classic game mechanism only indirectly.', 'When focusing on the playful aspect of a product, the design outcome is as much about mastery or competence as it is about creativity and fun. With elements of playfulness, the product is adaptable to a range of social situations and fun to use. It‚Äôs all about creating simple, minor actions that provide enjoyment and that the user can perform impulsively with little effort.', 'Playfulness is often the result of increasing both engagement and fun by guiding the user‚Äôs desired actions and behaviors. There are four aspects that guide playful design:', 'These four aspects of playful design can also be found in the famous engagement loop. The first step of creating the engagement loop is to understand what motivates our users. A successful product always solves a specific problem for users. That\'s why we at Futurice have the motto ""Love the problem, not the solution.""', ""The next step is to return to the concept of a learnable challenge. A challenge always has goals, which are directed by what we want users to do, and what they want to achieve. Once we know what our users' goals are, we can start thinking about the tools and resources we need to provide to help them achieve those goals. The goals can be arbitrary, but they must be clear and relevant to the current situation ‚Äì if they are not, the system loses credibility and quickly alienates users. Goals must also adapt to the users‚Äô increasing mastery of the challenge."", 'The third step is to design the interaction. The effort at which a user can perform an action should be small enough to quickly survey and make it fun to make progress. This, in turn, makes it easier and faster to go through the loop.', 'Lastly, the playful product provides a constant feedback system. Feedback should appeal to the motivation we identified earlier. This can be either immediate feedback about the action just performed or feedback about the status of the task. Feedback in the form of extrinsic rewards (for example generated ratings or points), while effective in the short term, is not sustainable in the long term. Either avoid them altogether, or back them up with intrinsic rewards so they transition into something longer-lasting. The important thing is to enrich the loop with a couple of fun elements to exploit the full potential of playful design.', 'With our client Buchinger Wilhelmi, we successfully applied the principles of playful design and integrated the engagement loop into a smartphone application. In the illustration below you can see a simplified representation of this in the context of Buchinger Wilhelmi.', 'So, in summary:', 'Great user experience consists of pragmatic quality (i.e. functional experience) and hedonic quality (i.e. emotional experience). Standing out from among the many great user-friendly products takes more than focus on the functional experience alone. I believe that fun playfulness has the potential to differentiate from other products.', 'Having fun with the process and ensuring that the user has fun with our product is all well and good, but what does all this mean from the business perspective?', 'Playful design can be used to drive participation and engagement. This can be achieved by integrating playful experiences and dynamics into our solutions. A well designed, dynamic and sustained playful experience can be put to use in accomplishing a variety of business goals. Consequently, playful design has the power to build loyalty and make happy designers, as well as to enhance user interaction.', 'Not only do we strongly believe in the power of playful design, but many statistics also show how it serves business well. This Gallup study, for example, suggests that improving employee engagement and happiness leads to higher profits, increased productivity, and greater user loyalty.', 'Here are some more statistics to prove the value of playful design:', 'Luckily, playful design doesn‚Äôt need to be difficult to implement. Even simple play time strategies can up the fun quotient in your office. The first step is simple: Have fun designing solutions, and change the famous slogan from ‚Äúwork hard, play hard‚Äù to ‚Äúplay hard, play hard.‚Äù']","['Provide the right functions so that users can accomplish their goals', 'Offer usability and reliability to prevent frustration from undermining the fun', 'Engage users with interactions', 'Give constant feedback', 'Instead of feedback systems, think of learnable challenges.', 'Understand that motivation comes from the satisfaction of the needs to feel competent, autonomous and related.', 'Use this understanding of motivation to connect goals and interaction.', 'Make it fun to use.', 'It increases engagement by as much as 48%', 'Employees rank a fun work environment higher than monetary rewards', '72% of people find games inspiring\n', 'Schiller, F.

"", ""The key to thrive today is to adopt a customer-and-outcomes-focused, digital-first, agile, and sustainable approach to your core business models. Good news is that it's not as hard nor as expensive as it may seem at first glance. Adopting an outcomes-focused, digital-first, agile, and sustainable approach to their business model and operations is how organizations will get there."", 'Let‚Äôs break down the concept to explore why this is.', 'An outcomes-focused approach means that organizations are laser-focused on delivering value to their customers - rather than simply delivering services, features or products quickly. By prioritizing outcomes, organizations can better understand the needs and wants of their customers, and design solutions that meet those needs in the most effective and efficient way possible. Business outcomes and customer focus are entirely interconnected, and include a perspective shift from time to market to time to value.', 'In our recent webinar on the benefits of customer focus, our Design Lead Arvid √Östr√∂m and I did a deep-dive on this topic. Here is a short clip where we highlight the common pitfall of thinking of business outcomes as something solely external, like selling more of a product or a service, and how focusing on the actual customer needs and zooming in on the problem you‚Äôre trying to solve is what brings the best and most efficient business outcomes.', 'A digital-first approach is key. This doesn‚Äôt just mean embracing technology and data as a key driver of your operations - automating processes, improving decision-making, data analytics and developing new digital products and services that meet customer needs. And it most certainly does not mean going digital just for the sake of it.  The goal should be enabling an agile environment where the company strategy and culture fosters innovation, resulting in this co-creation space of exploring and iterating on diverse technology and tools to develop digital solutions that truly bring value to your clients.', 'Agile organizations can quickly respond to ever-changing market conditions and customer needs, and continuously improve their operations with data-driven insights - improvise, adapt, overcome.', 'Being operationally efficient. Effectively using your resources and getting more out of your investments goes hand in hand with successful digital transformation and agility. Both of which directly impact your organization‚Äôs ability to withstand and recover from disruptions and challenges, and affect the sustainability of your organization. Sustainable development is the backbone of resilience and growth.', 'This spring we will be releasing an insightful and inspiring booklet on how organizations can harness the power of sustainability as a true business disruptor to propel value-adding twin transition, with expert insights from across sectors and throughout the value chain. Stay tuned for that one, and in the meantime, feel free to reach out and learn more about how your organization can create successful sustainable development frameworks for a resilient future, no matter what market.', ""Learn how loving the problem and a wholly customer-centric approach from business model and product innovation to service design, product strategy, and digital product development, can help you create sustainable value, take on emerging opportunities, and provide impactful outcomes for your organization - by creating solutions your customers won't want to part with."", 'Sustainable Futures is a yearly event organized by Futurice to explore challenges and opportunities organizations face when trying to build and implement sustainable development frameworks across the value chain.']",[]

', 'The linear, industrial paradigm is slowly but surely on the cusp of elimination. It served humanity well in the 20th century, but is obviously in dire need of a replacement.', 'Why is this transformation also of business interest? Apart from the most obvious fact that your company may not be on board with the daunting task of reversing biodiversity loss and mitigating climate change, there are several other risks associated with a ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù approach.', 'Here‚Äôs a reminder of why this work is not just for the sake of preserving our beautiful planet ‚Äì it also makes perfect business sense. Inaction is, in fact, associated with great risk.', 'If the leaders of a company do not consider sustainability as a viable business model, the risk is that they are vastly underestimating their customers‚Äô drive for a better tomorrow. Regardless of whether the target group is B2C or B2B (or B2B2C), you compete in a market where greenwashing and unsustainable brands are not only frowned upon, but rigorously challenged and eventually abandoned.', '‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to understand that the demand for sustainable products and services will grow rapidly in correlation with us realizing the consequences of an unsustainable development. With an increasing effect from climate change, more people will look for companies and brands that are offering concrete solutions,‚Äù says Rebecka Carlsson, Swedish sustainability advocate, and author of the transformation bible Exponential Climate Solutions.', 'Industrial value chains are not what they used to be ‚Äì passive producers, taking on any business proposal as long as it pays the bills. The industrial future will be created by collaborative ecosystems where circularity and data sharing is increasingly embedded in the business model for all actors.', 'The previous practice of shifting responsibilities to a distant Scope 3 is insufficient in a world where transparency and accountability prevails. If you don‚Äôt drop unsustainable suppliers (or collaborate to improve the situation), someone else will drop you. It‚Äôs time for ecosystem thinking.', 'Sustainability, at its core, boils down to a more clever and efficient use of our available resources. Using less chemicals and raw material means lower environmental impact and less waste; better working conditions entails higher talent retention, and limited spending on superficial benefits can allow for a more financially sound profit margin.', 'Rebecka Carlsson agrees: ‚ÄúThe world is changing, which means both shifting market demands and a completely different challenge in accessing raw materials and energy. The ability to create more value with less resources will make companies successful and resilient in the times ahead.‚Äù', 'Industrial processes and production from raw materials make up the predominant source of greenhouse gas emissions. A digital transformation, with all its promises from emerging technologies, may seem like a convenient antidote to unsustainable practices. But there are many considerations to take into account when it comes to digitalization as well. Tech platforms, data centers, blockchain technologies and AI models are all intense energy consumers as well. Breaking free from legacy systems can allow any business to address sustainability also at a truly deep and digital level.', 'Business as usual has been made possible within the regulatory framework we have built in the industrial era. And while many activists feel that green legislation works slower than the world would need it to, tides are truly turning in the coming decade. Sustainability regulations will undoubtedly tighten the grip on business practices on a global scale. Unsustainable brands will not win tenders and contracts.', '‚ÄúThe EU Taxonomy will put a lot of pressure on transparency and sustainability reporting, and we will shortly see the implementation of a digital product pass for products, that contains all the sustainability data from the production and distribution. In order to create a circular economy, traceability and transparency are key factors, not only for raw materials, but also when it comes to social sustainability. The footprints can no longer remain invisible to customers, auditors and investors,‚Äù says Rebecka Carlsson.', 'There are endless opportunities in making business processes more automated and resource efficient. Machine learning, big data and increasingly powerful artificial intelligence models will allow for a far more smart and data-centric approach when it comes to everything from administration to marketing, human resources, and sustainability reporting. The digital and sustainable transformations are closely intertwined.', 'The capital flows are shifting. Investors will no longer be prone to pour capital into industries and innovations that do not address sustainability or circularity. This shift comes both from stakeholders and an increased enthusiasm for true impact, but in large part also from the fact that there is considerable risk associated with unsustainable practices. Not just from a market perspective, but also when it comes to assets such as real estate, production facilities and work environment. Stranded assets are not just related to fossil fuel.', '‚ÄúThe financial sector has been late into the game, but a lot is happening at the moment. Many investment companies and funds are joining the Science Based Targets for a 1,5 degree pathway. The pace will surely pick up fast‚Äù, says Rebecka Carlsson.', 'Cultural shifts do not always come from the C-level management or board rooms. Are young talents gravitating towards your brand and yearn to work for your company? If this is a challenge, there might be missed opportunities in the making. Defining a strong purpose, a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù if you will, could change everything from strategic decisions to mindset and corporate culture. Employees should be the strongest natural ambassadors of your brand. If not, something might be wrong.', 'By fostering a culture of innovation, co-creation and trial and error, we can empower employees to iterate and experiment more to create better solutions. And their drive comes from a sense of purpose and motivation.', 'The market is allergic to greenwashing. However, communicating sustainable practices can still be a cost-efficient way of building trust and brand loyalty. Nobody‚Äôs perfect, but every step in the right direction should count. Sara Davidson, Global Marketing and Communication Manager at Klarna, elaborated on this balance between greenwashing and greenhushing during the Futurice roundtable event Sustainable Futures:', 'Every company should talk about their sustainability journey and where they‚Äôre at. I‚Äôm afraid that many companies miss out on the journey because they don‚Äôt see the benefits of marketing and communications in relation to the sustainability work. And you don‚Äôt have to do everything, you can be an expert in your field and work with experts in other parts of the value chain. Those collaborations are key for success, breaking the silos.', 'The shift from a linear to a circular economy is no quick fix. Circularity needs to be embedded in everything from design to production and waste management. Is the product made for reuse, recycling or refurbishment? Can it be re-assembled? In many instances, one company‚Äôs waste can be another one‚Äôs asset. By collaborating with others, industrial symbiosis may be a beneficial practice for everyone involved.', 'With a circular mindset, new design challenges arise. Electrification, product-as-a-service business models and sharing platforms often create a demand for entirely new competencies. Embrace that challenge.

The basic elements of our culture ‚Äì the values and principles behind our decision-making process ‚Äì remain unchanged, but the ways in which they manifest in our everyday lives had evolved.

Our purpose was to create a real grassroots level view of what Futurice looks like, and we felt that collecting meaningful stories across the company would be the best way to approach that.

How should a dedicated team drive a brand evolution and gain people‚Äôs buy-in? ', 'We were facing this question last winter. At the start of Futurice‚Äôs brand evolution process in November 2021, we recognized our brand maturity in all of our operating markets varied greatly, our visual identity was living its own life and our brand assets were scattered around the wilds of Google Drive. Empowering people to use our brand assets more impactfully in their work and gaining buy-in during the brand evolution were our main goals, but where to start?', 'First, it was essential to communicate openly about the fact that we were starting the process to make sure the internal rumor mill didn‚Äôt get started. Next, we sat down to identify different internal target groups: leadership, sales, brand enthusiasts and the company-wide audience. The evolution process started with workshops led by our partner Mutabor (partner selection was a transparent process of its own, but that is a subject for a blog post all its own), where several participants from global and local leadership teams together defined our positioning, brand personality and a direction for our brand manifesto. All fairly normal elements for this type of process.', 'Getting the buy-in from the whole organization, Including just the leadership, is, of course, not enough. As far as people‚Äôs daily work, one of our key brand assets is our presentation template. We wanted to understand which branded templates are in use and why, and what our consultants need when putting together a proposal, presentation, or pitch. We ran through a series of user interviews with consultants who work closely with clients in accounts. The interviews validated our hypothesis: the materials and assets must be easy to find and use for the brand to be used. These became a couple of the main goals for the whole evolution.', 'But this still wasn‚Äôt enough. We wanted to open the brand evolution process to feedback from all  Futuriceans as soon as possible but struggled with how to do it in a way that helps us instead of slowing the work down and weakening the outcome. Some level of visual direction for the brand is needed for the discussion to be worthwhile but what level is enough, but not too far evolved leaving no room for real dialogue? How to be transparent and hear people out without the brand becoming a compromise that feels boring to all audiences?', 'When we had the brand strategy and story outlined and some visual direction scoped, it was time to open the discussion.', 'We openly called for anyone to join in either a brand sounding board (regular meetings and updates) or tasters (one-offs). We also recognized brand enthusiasts across the company and approached them personally.', 'We started with the tasters, where we shared the status quo of the design. We had a brand manifesto ready, but there were still several options for visual direction. This was pretty nerve-wracking in a company with a community of over 120 designers, but we gained a lot of insight, especially into accessibility and usability. When we were undecided on something, we opened it for discussion with the sounding board. Over a period of a couple of months, we had approximately 50 people from across the company join in the workshops, tasters and the sounding board.', 'In June 2022, we organized a  company-wide taster. The brand visuality was still not entirely ready and there were still multiple open issues, but we communicated this clearly in the taster. We also shared the aims for the whole process openly,  why certain choices had been made and opened all documentation for everyone to read. This taster made us realize there were still some pain points within the visuality and the need for iteration. This session especially received a lot of positive feedback for transparency in communications.', 'Throughout the process, our partner Mutabor supported us in engaging in an open dialogue within our company and also appreciated the feedback received. Together we defined and prioritized the areas where changes were still needed.', 'While getting closer to the launch, we kept on communicating about the status quo. After the summer, there was a brief update on the schedule to remind people about the ongoing evolution. Eventually, getting everything ready for the launch was so hectic that having the people participate at this stage did not improve the process or the outcome anymore. Luckily we had heard so many people along the way that we felt confident about the direction the brand evolution had taken.', 'Since making the brand easy to use and access was one of our main goals, we needed a solution to make it possible ‚Äì a brand management platform. We ended up going with Frontify. Managing a brand with several hundred users would not have been possible without such a well-working, scalable tool. Now our brand strategy, design elements, asset libraries, decks and key communication guidelines are all collected in one place, which saves time for all users.', 'Finally, it was time to launch the brand evolution outcomes, the guideline built in Frontify and all the various brand assets we had produced.', 'We decided early on not to have a big bang of a launch but rather a smooth transition into the new look and feel with a new website, digital marketing assets and sales materials. For it to actually be smooth, we realized it would require empowering all Futuriceans to use the evolved brand assets.', 'The key to making this happen was, again, all about internal communication. We wanted to repeat the message of the evolution process being conducted so the brand would better serve our people: that it be readily available, easier to use and more clearly distinguish Futurice from the competition. What surprised us was that since we had so many of our people participate, the brand evolution work was exceptionally well received. People felt they had seen the material already, been kept aware of the process and heard.', 'Since we had recognized the deck as a pain point for many of our people, we specifically provided support and training in transitioning to the new deck template. We also set up a #brand_aid slack channel for any brand-related questions.', 'Traditionally, the Futurice onboarding process hasn‚Äôt included anything about our brand, and we wanted to change this. After the launch, we organized several onboardings on the brand itself, on the use of Frontify and the features of the deck template. So far, we have trained several hundred Futuriceans in the evolved brand and have had several hundred Futuriceans visit Frontify. In the future, the brand will also be included in the global onboarding of new people.', 'Even though leading a transparent brand evolution can sometimes be scary, it comes with great rewards. We have now seen that people better accept changes to the brand when they are already somewhat familiar with them and feel they have been part of the process. The buy-in has already been gained along the way, and the pressure is not on the launch anymore.', 'It is also important to bear in mind that leading a transparent and participative brand evolution process is a two-way street, so the iterative process continues after the launch. We receive requests and feedback on the #brand_aid slack channel, and many have already been taken into production or added to our backlog. We have found this helpful. Since our people use the assets, they know best what works and doesn‚Äôt. Continuous improvement is one of our key values so the evolution journey of the Futurice brand continues.', 'Read what Finnish marketing media outlet, MarkkinointiUutiset wrote about the brand launch here (article in Finnish).']",[]

The digital business landscape is changing so rapidly and so constantly that no company can ever claim to have reached full digital maturity; it‚Äôs less of a fixed point to strive for and more of an ongoing adaptation process ‚Äì and that process is digital transformation.', ""Digital transformation can take many forms; every organization has different customer challenges, priorities, values and resources, so as with any maturation process it‚Äôs rarely linear and never straightforward. Each organization needs to define what digital maturity means for them, based on their strategic goals and what's blocking goal achievement. That said, some typical hallmarks of maturity include having a clear and cohesive digital strategy, a habit of working cross-functionally and collaboratively, a long-term mindset and a culture of experimentation towards innovation."", 'The main benefit of undergoing digital transformation is resilience to change and uncertainty. Digital transformation can help an organization to future-proof in several ways:', 'In addition to data-driven insights, another key element of creating true value through digital transformation is opening up the opportunity to collaborate in ecosystems.', 'In recent years there has been an increasing movement towards a new paradigm of innovating through cross-company and cross-industry co-operation, leading to new business models built on digital platforms. This approach enables companies to create synergistic value beyond their own internal capabilities by breaking up large-scale silos and allowing data and innovation to flow between companies and even industries, benefiting all parties by creating far greater efficiencies and customer value.', 'The decisions that are now being made around digital ecosystems will pave the way for organizations to grow and extend their value chains in the future. Because data is central to the insights that drive this movement, the ability to collect, clean, interpret and utilize it effectively is critical to value creation.', 'For an organization looking to mature digitally, an important starting point is to pinpoint its current maturity level. But because different things work for different companies and there‚Äôs no single way to do digital transformation, there isn‚Äôt really a consistent performance to benchmark against. So how can we recognise digital maturity when we see it, and is it even possible to measure or quantify?', 'Take for example the work we‚Äôve done with PHHYKY. Once a company has identified its current maturity level, it will have better visibility of what it needs to do to get to the next milestone. Rather than using a framework to simply take a snapshot of the present situation and then accept or forget about it, organizations should check in frequently to identify their maturity level and then use this information to plan for the next stage in their transformation journey. At PHHYKY, we prioritized the customer-facing departments and their processes. Digitizing those creates the most value for the organization, and we were able to achieve quantifiable improvements to their digital maturity, based on a matrix that consisted of both quantitative and qualitative data, looking at stakeholder interviews, visibility, digital tool utilization and benefits to the customers served, arriving at a quantifiable 20.6% increase in PHHYKY‚Äôs digital maturity level.', 'Many times, organizations‚Äô top leadership commonly believes that they can simply buy new technology, implement it quickly, and immediately start reaping the benefits - which is quite mistaken.There are many factors that contribute to the 70% failure rate of digital transformation journeys. So what are companies getting wrong?', 'First - mind-set and culture. Long-term, outcomes-focused thinking and a culture of experimentation and taking failures as learnings is the first step towards a successful digital transformation journey. Second - placing all their bets on technology. Of course, broadly speaking, the more recent and advanced the tools are, the better results one can expect, however, it‚Äôs not the technology used that is at the core of digital transformation failures, it‚Äôs that digital by default creates disruptive effects on businesses, requiring them to make significant changes to their organizational structure - from policies and processes, to procedures, and sometimes even a complete overhaul of their business model and talent acquisition, retaining and upskilling pipelines. It‚Äôs a lot of change to address.', 'There are also internal factors that can hold an organization back from maturing digitally, some of which are easier to overcome than others. For instance, even if a company has the desire to develop its digital capabilities and a clear concept for doing so, it could get stuck if it lacks the requisite budget, internal expertise, strategy or tools. On the other hand, a company in that position is still likely to be much closer to digital maturity than those that aren‚Äôt even prepared to adapt their culture and mindset to support innovation.', 'The process of digital transformation can feel pretty daunting but as long as the will is there, there are always steps that can be taken. When we work with our clients to develop their digital capabilities, we start by identifying what their biggest obstacles are and where they can most efficiently create value for their customers. This helps them to see the wood from the trees and leads naturally to setting out a pathway for what comes next, whether that‚Äôs developing a new product, service, business model or carrying out further testing.', 'A good place to start is identifying the goal of this digital transformation journey - what is that the organization is hoping to achieve - and map out what is needed to reach the goal. Knowing that these journeys are long-term, and approaching the development process through agile sprints, makes the whole thing more tangible and achievable. It‚Äôs also important to involve all stakeholders from both technical and product teams, as well as the business units heads, and generally break down the organizational silos, since digital transformation both encompasses and affects the entire organization.', 'If you‚Äôre wondering how to get started with your digital transformation process or want to discuss digital maturity with our experts, make sure to get in touch.']","['increasing efficiency', 'harnessing innovation', 'developing closer relationships with customers', 'building a data strategy that improves value creation\nbeing culturally and structurally prepared to adopt digital technologies that can help the organization thrive as the future unfolds', 'saving resources by automating manual work', 'creating value by harnessing data that can help the company better understand its processes, value chains, customers and competitors']"

But we see these temporary bans as things that will be solved in the future as the commercial potential is huge and somebody will find a way to clarify all this legal side sooner or later.', 'While we consider these following trends as ""things featured everywhere"", we do have slightly mixed feelings on how these will actually realize their hype value in the near term. WIll they actually ease the lives of the end users or bring in any of the benefits they advertise to IT departments and C-level decision makers around the globe?', 'With no clear one-size-fits-all explanation of what the Metaverse is, it has  become a synonym to ""We use a digital thing to boost our physical thing"".

In addition to creating products that better satisfy customer needs, shifting to a value-focused mindset also helps save time and money, making organizations more efficient and resilient to an increasingly uncertain future.', 'The benefits of efficiently getting a product from concept to market are obvious, and time to market (TTM) is often seen by companies as a key metric to optimize. But that‚Äôs far from the end of the story ‚Äì getting a product to market quickly is critical, but the value it offers customers is what really matters. This makes time to value (TTV) the more important metric to focus on, because it guides organizations to create something that solves their customers‚Äô problems rather than simply releasing products for the sake of it.', 'The main benefit of viewing projects through a value lens is increased efficiency. Paying attention to solving the right problems and involving the right people (both customers and internal stakeholders) in an iterative process where value is identified and created right from the beginning can save significant time, money and resources. It also leads to better outcomes. Having an overly siloed business that‚Äôs missing the bigger-picture view of what value means for customers can block progress, which is quite common when an organizational culture focuses on solutions and platforms instead of loving the problem itself. Changing this mindset and removing organizational silos are two ways to improve TTV. Refocusing from TTM to TTV could be seen as a shift of mindset from proof of concept ‚Äì simply creating something that works ‚Äì to proof of value.', 'It might not be an easy or smooth transition for organizations to shift towards a stronger value focus by themselves. When we work with companies looking to achieve the fastest possible TTV in a holistic way, we emphasize the importance of prioritizing effectively, communicating the importance of creating value and involving key stakeholders throughout the process. Prioritizing the tasks that most efficiently create value enables us to reach beneficial outcomes quicker. You can do this by dividing a project into bite-sized chunks and starting with areas where you can make the most impact with the least effort.', 'Getting the important internal experts and decision makers excited from the early stages of a project will improve efficiency down the line, as once their contribution is needed they‚Äôre already prepared and excited to be part of a project whose benefit they can clearly see. Involving them early will also create a sense of ‚Äúteam‚Äù, helping to break up silos that could otherwise block progress by keeping everyone on the same page and enabling a co-creative process.', 'How does being more efficient lead to improved resiliency, though? Efficiency is a powerful health metric as it frees time, money and other resources to change direction in response to emerging needs, making companies more likely to survive whatever the future may hold. If an organization is able to respond to market changes by turning solutions around quickly while still emphasizing value creation, it will be in a more stable position to deal with uncertainty. This makes it more important than ever for companies to know where they should be focusing their resources for maximum value ‚Äì and if the budget for a project is limited, it only highlights the need to use that investment effectively.', 'It‚Äôs vital to pinpoint where you can create value for your customers and focus on doing so from the start. A useful question that helps to identify the right things to prioritize in a project and create meaningful value at the quickest possible pace is, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the smallest thing we can do to get to value?‚Äù This philosophy helps you to protect your organization‚Äôs investment from the start by delivering quicker outcomes.', 'Rather than going through the whole process of getting a product from concept to market with the idea that you can‚Äôt release anything until it‚Äôs finalized, figure out where you can immediately create value with a smaller step. An example for an existing product that needs updating could be looking at how you can implement the project one step at a time, making the biggest impact on business outcomes at each stage with the smallest effort. Dividing projects into smaller, bite-sized chunks in this way also makes it more comfortable for your stakeholders to commit, as it makes the scale of the project feel less daunting.', 'When creating new products, we tell our clients they should look to release something as soon as they can and then start testing so they can build value more quickly through an iterative, customer-focused process. At Futurice, we talk a lot about striving for the minimum lovable product (MLP) rather than the minimum viable product (MVP). This concept is closely connected with value creation ‚Äì we‚Äôre looking to produce the minimum output that will have some value in the shortest possible time, not just a working prototype. It may sound nice and fluffy, but MLP is a serious concept ‚Äì it involves proving that the product is lovable by measuring its outcomes against carefully considered and clearly defined metrics.', 'In a 2017 project, we were tasked with helping Finavia prepare for the rapidly rising demand for air travel while maintaining its reputation as one of the world‚Äôs most innovative and customer-centered airport operators. The aim was to do this by offering passengers all the information and services they need, updated in real time, through all key digital touchpoints for a stress-free traveling experience. Through a combination of the Helsinki Airport app, online parking reservations, information screens and Finavia‚Äôs website, we were able to create a highly personalized and seamless omnichannel customer journey.', 'We also developed a robust and highly scalable microservice system to support these digital channels, helping Finavia to achieve an accelerated time to market for service and feature updates. We used quick iterative cycles in a value-led process, involving user research, user journey mapping and ideation workshops with key stakeholders. This helped Finavia get to the bottom of its users‚Äô needs and deliver a solution to satisfy them in a timely way. The process allowed us to create value very quickly and then continue building more value into the solution iteratively rather than delaying the release until everything was ‚Äúperfect‚Äù.', 'The outcome gave Finavia a competitive advantage, with the smooth customer experience helping the organization improve its performance in terms of page views, registered users and revenue.

People are amazing']","['Since moving to Germany five years ago, Thomas has worked very closely with innovation communities and the start-up scene, even co-creating a tech group focused on developing smart cities. Here he reflects on eight key things he‚Äôs learned along the way.\n', 'It‚Äôs not enough to say you want to bring people together, you need a common topic or purpose that sums up the reason for your community to exist. This is a mistake a lot of institutions make when trying to build a community ‚Äì they can bring a lot of people together, but groups won‚Äôt survive without a common drive. For example, one community I facilitated, Smart City Germany, brings together representatives from start-ups, established corporates and city administrations who all share the goal of developing a smart city that is more technological and sustainable, with the wellbeing of its citizens at its heart.', 'It‚Äôs important to understand people‚Äôs motives for joining', 'In addition to being interested in the topic, they might also be looking for job opportunities, for example. By understanding the members of your community and knowing why they‚Äôre there, you can provide real added value by giving them what they need.', 'Another factor to consider is whether people will meet virtually or physically ‚Äì if it‚Äôs virtual, like a Slack channel, you need someone online to keep the group alive, whereas if it‚Äôs a physical community you need a framework like events or workshops to bring people together. For both types of community, a moderator is key ‚Äì someone who constantly adds value by creating interactions, engagement and activities.', 'I‚Äôm a member of the 2hearts community, which offers mentorship and peer-to-peer collaboration for a diverse group of people in the German tech community with immigration backgrounds. 2hearts is a great example of how to be inclusive and welcoming ‚Äì they communicate their goal and purpose clearly and are open to a diverse range of backgrounds. As a result, their community is super active and people give each other good advice and support with no compensation. Everyone in the group is an immigrant, but that‚Äôs the only trait they share ‚Äì otherwise it‚Äôs really diverse.', 'The biggest challenge when running a community is to keep it alive ‚Äì people only continue being part of a group if they get added value and have a sense of belonging. The other main challenge is content. People often join a community to promote something, so it‚Äôs very easy for it to become a promotional or sales channel. To stop this happening, it‚Äôs important to set rules or filter the content.', 'The thing I enjoy most about my work with communities is sharing experiences ‚Äì the opportunity to learn from others, talk about my own experiences and be heard. I also enjoy the potential for collaboration ‚Äì it‚Äôs natural for people to look at what they can gain from communities, and there are lots of hidden opportunities for mutual benefit that can come from participating.', 'Networking is a discovery skill and that‚Äôs very important for innovation. Talking with people from different backgrounds helps you generate new ideas and see products, processes, services or even business models from other perspectives ‚Äì it‚Äôs certainly helped me in my role as a business designer and innovation strategist.', 'I encourage everyone to participate in communities or create their own, because in the end you will definitely gain ‚Äì learning from your peers is always a good thing. Everyone has their own goals and is working on their own stuff, so you can share your experiences freely and everyone will get something out of the interaction.', 'At the end of the day, all businesses are people businesses. Whenever you do business you‚Äôre working with people, and it‚Äôs the same thing with communities. There‚Äôs a book I can recommend here ‚Äì Humankind: A Hopeful History by Rutger Bregman ‚Äì which presents the theory that humans are good by nature. I think that‚Äôs also evident in communities: you see the good in people, and often they want to give more than they receive.', ""Interested in reading more stories about us and our people?

In The State of AI in 2021, 11% of the respondents indicated that they have recently invested in AI solution development in supply chain management:', '‚ÄúWhile AI‚Äôs revenue benefits have held steady or even decreased since the previous survey ‚Äì especially for supply chain management, where AI was unlikely to compensate for the pandemic era‚Äôs global supply chain challenges ‚Äì the opposite is true of costs. Respondents report significantly greater cost savings from AI than they did previously in every function, with the biggest year-over-year changes in the shares reporting cost takeout from using AI in product and service development, marketing and sales, and strategy and corporate finance.‚Äù', 'The reasoning for these investments seems quite clear: over 50% of the respondents in the same survey have noted significant (higher than 20%) cost reductions attributed to AI and data.', ""The 2021 survey also notes that use cases for AI in supply chain management are increasing. Leading use cases paint a clear picture centered around value network optimization, emphasizing the holistic nature and role of supply chains with the company's entire value stream. McKinsey‚Äôs analysis identified two leading supply chain management use cases ‚Äì optimization of the logistics network, and sales and demand forecasting."", 'The traditional view of supply chain management largely focused on optimizing the unidirectional flow of materials and services, and with a more limited amount of information, the flow backward. Information over multiple steps is often transmitted as a static snapshot that moves together with long planning cycles ‚Äì ranging from 36 months on the strategic level to annual 12-month planning and six-month tactical planning. The slow flow of information often stems from limitations in processes, data and reporting.', 'Compared to the current state, the most important benefit that more modern data and information architecture trends have to offer is to enable near real-time multidirectional information flow between different functions and processes.', 'When it comes to data flow and use of data and AI in supply chain management, this is a revolutionary shift, and it is focused around these themes:', 'The enthusiasm and excitement we see today revolves largely around digital twins. Perhaps the most hyped aspect is the ability to not just visualize complex systems ‚Äì but also simulate and create scenarios, continuously improve operations and better adapt to changing internal and external circumstances. The goal is excellent ‚Äì but the reality is that companies are often not yet mature enough in their data and analytics journey to jump straight into fully modeled digital twins.', 'Based on the work we‚Äôve done together with our clients, we can outline three typical steps for growing data maturity both within supply chain management and beyond:', 'Currently, the focus is usually on establishing data enablers like data platforms and data catalogs, and on working on early productionized point solutions. Some companies are already moving towards a machine learning solution portfolio that covers multiple parts of their value streams. At least for now, we seldom see full digital twins with significant simulation capabilities.', 'When introducing data and AI capabilities, approaches typically go through quite similar steps starting from visualization and sharing real-time data between functions, then creating point solutions, and finally, moving towards a solution portfolio that spans multiple value streams.', 'This may sound a bit abstract ‚Äì so what could these point solutions actually be? Many public references and examples have to do with establishing data flow between processes and functions, as well as creating new information with machine learning models.

Supply chain management will also involve more artificial intelligence, both in material and logistics flow and in information flow.', 'A bit further down the road, digital twins with simulation capabilities and scenario building will also become more common in supply chain management.

Read more!,"['The challenges IT departments face today are formidable', 'Managed services - what could go wrong?', 'A common example of local optimization', 'Modern managed services', 'The mission of modern managed services: make the IT department lovable again']","['Using managed IT services can bring your organization lots of benefits. Lower costs, scaling when needed, helping you to concentrate on your core business, and not having to acquire and keep all the special experts are few of the common ones. The benefits are clear, but what about the problems? Read what modern managed services are and how they avoid the pitfalls of traditional managed services.', 'The era of public clouds, anything-as-a-services, pre-made frameworks, and tools has made it possible to develop and run digital services with fewer resources. However, the complexity of managing dozens or hundreds of services, vendors, service providers, applications, and teams is not an easy task.', 'Offloading part of that complexity and workload to your partners is a sound strategy. That enables your business to operate at peak efficiency without investing in additional internal IT staff. A good partner will also help you improve IT efficiency, reduce your in-house overheads, decrease downtime as well as create tangible business and customer value.', ""The usual case of externalizing some of the responsibilities starts by defining a clear bounded box. These are the systems, these are the responsibilities and minimum services levels and these are the sanctions if you don't meet the levels."", 'That is very human. Dividing complex and large systems into smaller, clearly bounded, and interfaced pieces, is a way to manage complexity. However, although these clearly defined and bound boxes help deal with complexity, they might hurt the overall ability to create value.', 'Value chains go over multiple services, services span multiple systems and most of the services are dependent on the other services. The more you have these clearly defined boxes with individual teams, the harder it is to get something done from idea to production and ensure effective end-to-end value creation. Unless you deliberately measure and incentive that across all of your vendors and services.', 'Local optimization is a problem that hides well. Individual service might have 99.9999% uptime but you still have a hard time serving your paying end users. Local optimization leads to wasted resources, causing bottlenecks, slowness, and unhappy business, developers, and end-users.', 'Local optimization and local autonomy are not absolute evils, quite opposite. Usually, agility, ownership, and ability to invent are better in smaller units. However, not seeing the bigger picture, the value chains, and measuring what matters, can lead to losing all the huge benefits you could get by building a system that is loosely coupled and tightly aligned, pulling all into the same direction.', 'For example, let‚Äôs assume the organization has some internal service that works as a master data storage. It is easy to understand the importance of said service, thus strict SLAs are made to ensure that the vendor keeps the system in good shape.', 'The organization has lots of development teams creating business features. They try to contact the team maintaining the internal service because they need help or changes to the service API. Usually, there is no way to contact the external vendor‚Äôs team directly, only through tickets. Because changes and service requests have looser SLAs than incidents, they get deprioritized.', 'That causes development teams to have to wait. Eventually, the maintenance team answers the ticket, but rarely do things get solved immediately. Correspondence ping-pong starts and it takes a damn too long time to get anything done.', ""That might eventually lead to shadow IT. Business decides to work around the slowness and stiffness of internal service and build parts of the same functionality by themselves. That is a waste of resources, but usually, the only way to ensure business agility. I‚Äôve seen dozens and dozens of ‚Äúwe have master data in SAP, but because we can't get support from the vendor maintaining the service, we have to build our own duplicated data storage‚Äù."", 'I believe that it is time for ‚Äúmodern managed services‚Äù. Help the IT organization and business, but do it in a more holistic, more modern way, to avoid the common pitfalls that the traditional managed IT services bring to the organizations.', 'Steer away from the local optimization and start describing and measuring the important value chains and the end-to-end value. Measure what your paying customers see. Measure how well your development teams can get help from other teams. Measure the speed from idea to production. Go from a system and ticket-centric approach to an outcome and service-centric approach. Enforce and measure how well external vendors serve the other teams, not just what is the uptime of the system.', 'IT departments are loved by the rest of the organization when they can efficiently enable and support business to create value. IT is there to help and enable, not block or be a bottleneck.', 'However, this tango takes two. The common responsibilities of an IT department cannot be forgotten, but some of them can be made as business decisions. What is the SLA of our online store? That should be a decision made by the business, not the IT department.', 'The business should know how much it costs them if the service is down, so it should be their decision to set the desired SLA to a sweet spot. Any higher would be a waste as increased SLA always costs more, any lower would be too little compared to the criticality and business value of the service.', 'Site Reliability Engineering tackles some of these issues. It brings down the unnecessary silo between business and IT, and builds a culture where you start measuring relevant things. Not just uptime or how many tickets and how fast did get solved. But instead, do the end users find the products they want to buy, or how well the external team managing some internal system has been able to serve dependent development teams?', 'Measuring what matters makes the traditional IT metrics business decisions. It enables outcome and service-based thinking, where value is measured end-to-end. Not just how well some individual system or vendor works.', 'We believe modern managed IT services partners should be passionate about both managing services but also help organizations to transform from an expensive but stiff ticket and system-based approach to the outcome and service-based approach with lesser total costs.']",[]

It means that every employee is empowered to make improvements to ensure the ‚Äúflow of value‚Äù to customers. In other words, a company that has embraced operational excellence is able to maximize the value it provides for its customers.', 'In healthcare, operational excellence is the understanding involved in using principles and tools to deliver continuous improvement for patients and staff. Usually this means a focus on accessibility, processes and efficiency, quality and safety, and clinical outcomes.', 'This article is the start of a series exploring the practicalities of operational excellence in healthcare. It looks more closely at the traditional healthcare organization and the potential of a connected company (the ultimate goal of operational excellence).', 'So how can healthcare providers focus on delivering value with an operational excellence mindset? One answer lies in the concept of the connected company. Before discussing the connected company though, we first need to look at what typically happens in a traditional organization over time. When an organization is still small, different departments are still able to communicate and keep on top of what each other are doing. Overall, the various parts can still maintain a clear overview of what‚Äôs going on across the organization.', 'Healthcare organizations are notorious for being disconnected due to multiple roles, departments and processes all working in a siloed manner.  These disconnections occur because of the lack of a common direction, knowledge sharing and communication ‚Äì which can cause ineffective decisions, duplication, excess work, firefighting and sub-optimal results.', 'A connected company is one that has successfully tackled disconnection and achieved cohesion between its various functions. This means everyone has a big-picture overview that allows individuals and teams to keep track of what‚Äôs going on elsewhere in the company, coordinate processes and share valuable information.', 'Analysis', 'A real-life example of using a connected company approach is a healthcare system that developed visualization dashboards to improve situational awareness in COVID-19 telehealth initiatives.

Through this process they identified three distinct stakeholder groups, designing and developing visualization dashboards to meet each of their needs. User feedback demonstrated that the dashboards supported situational awareness and helped to inform important operational decisions.', 'We fully trust that a connected company structure will result in operational excellence as data becomes the key enabler for decision making and knowledge sharing. This is the case regardless of the industry, domain or organizational structure.', 'Beyond solving problems within the organization, data also has the power to positively impact patient outcomes and satisfaction. Leaders can set their clinical teams up for success when it comes to providing higher-quality care and creating a personalized patient experience. Healthcare leaders have the opportunity to transform their organizations if they optimize how they collect, analyze and use data ‚Äì but they can‚Äôt do it alone. To reap the potential rewards of data, healthcare leaders must recruit and develop talented individuals with the necessary skills and attributes to support a data-driven organization and a culture that prioritizes innovation.', 'Analysis', 'According to Healthleaders, ‚Äúthough 54% of healthcare leaders view data utilization as a top business need, many consider their organizations to be data-rich but insight-poor. Organizations have ample raw data, but leaders are unsure of how to translate data into action that improves organizational, financial and clinical outcomes.‚Äù', 'What can be done?', 'The key to successful data utilization is determining the right data to analyze and then using the findings to create strategies.

Data not only helps us identify internal threats or weaknesses, but it can also assist in uncovering the root causes behind these weaknesses ‚Äì  enabling healthcare leaders and their teams to tackle them. Comprehensive performance insights can lead to innovation in many forms, from building new business models and making strategic technology investments to facilitating transformative partnerships.', 'The end result of a connected, data-led approach is a healthcare organization that can enable operational excellence to become more patient centric, valuable, resilient and interoperable.', 'Are you interested in operational excellence in healthcare ‚Äì either learning more or providing your insights to us?

Business owners should take the role of internal champion for the project, driving the adoption of the solution and helping to overcome any technical infrastructure or access issues. ML projects are also slightly more involved for stakeholders. With many solutions being so close to the value-creating core, a lot of process work and training may be needed within the organization.', 'An optimally structured development team would be able to deliver end-to-end development. ML projects are often delivered in fast development sprints of around one to two weeks to allow a short feedback loop.', 'An optimally structured team might look like this:', 'In many companies, machine learning solutions are developed by centralized teams that rotate from project to project, working in different business units with only short stints in each business context. This leads to shallow point solutions that just answer the business unit‚Äôs specific problems. This kind of approach can be very successful if the business units and the problem spaces share many similarities. Still, it can also be detrimental to the full adoption of the ML solutions produced.', 'In order to get the most out of machine learning, it is highly beneficial for machine learning specialists to be integrated into teams. This integration allows them to build deeper domain understanding and familiarise themselves with the intricacies of the value creation process. It also makes the team more committed to the long-term success of the ML projects (actual value creation) and can improve the identification and proactive pitching of new machine learning solutions for the business.', 'Another benefit often missed is the inclusion of data professionals in solution planning and architecture, which allows data and machine learning to be taken into account in the early phases of planning a solution rather than being an afterthought. This enables faster and more varied data business case development, as these aspects are noted in the initial solution development. Ultimately, any solutions should always be owned by the business.', ""Experience has shown me that around 80% of the value of ML cases can be captured with relatively simplistic models and architecture. This means that at the outset of your project, you probably won't need to account for the four-yearly seasonal effect of the Olympics on your weekly forecasting model, for example. This simplified approach also enables faster development and testing cycles. Doing a quick and dirty test run can save you many headaches down the line. In this sense, the same applies in ML as in development in general: ‚Äúpremature optimization is the root of all evil‚Äù ‚Äì any technical sophistication and integrations can follow at a later stage."", 'When data exploration starts, the project team and stakeholders often start finding new avenues based on the data. This can often lead to a new round of ideation around the topic, which can cause branching of focus that will most likely be detrimental to the original goal. Ideation can be very beneficial but it should be handled in a highly structured manner by adding new avenues to the backlog and investigating further only when the original goal has been achieved or there is a need to pivot the original goal due to model or data limitations. You should handle new ideas with care, as shutting down people‚Äôs views and ideas can leave them thinking that you‚Äôre fixated on progressing with your own. It is essential to communicate clearly that new ideas cannot be pursued due to the limitations of the current project scope but that they will be included in the backlog from which new business cases can be built.', 'In comparison with traditional software development projects, ML projects have more uncertainty built-in due to data quality, integrations, modeling work, and so on. It‚Äôs essential to communicate with all relevant stakeholders about any unsuccessful results or poor performance, as there may be domain-specific data issues or other anomalies in the data collection process that need to be fixed. Any communication should be addressed to a broad audience, and during the project, you should keep every end-user informed about how the solution will affect their workflow.', 'For this reason, it is recommended that you communicate more during the data exploration phase than you would in traditional software projects to build trust among stakeholders and identify any domain-specific data issues early on.', 'During the modeling phase, the following themes should be communicated, although there is no need to go too deep into the technical aspects:', 'It‚Äôs also recommended that meetings are held at least weekly, or even short ones each day.', 'If the business case and technical setup allow, I recommend that you run testing in a rapid cycle to form a development-business feedback loop. Depending on the case, backtesting, simulations and live A/B testing should also be run on limited exposure to testing for any interactions or anomalies that have not yet been accounted for. An excellent example of this is that while a recommender model may perform very well in offline testing when run with users, we may notice an adverse effect on some metrics that were not the targets of the optimization.', 'Achieving a fast feedback cycle between data professionals and business owners can be the difference between success and failure. Machine learning solutions benefit significantly from a short feedback cycle. This is especially true in the early data exploration phase, where assumptions about the data sources are validated. My recommendation is to hold weekly meetings, but daily sessions should be considered during the most intensive data exploration phase.', 'A fast feedback cycle is also relevant to the following key point. If the data or methodologies do not support the initial business cases, pivot your machine learning projects quickly and move to some adjacent aspect of the problem. Pivoting quickly can save much time and allow for the creation of backlog items for further data collection, or infrastructure can be created for the original idea. The purpose of the fast feedback cycle is to speed up the idea‚ÄìMVP‚Äìproduction‚Äìbacklog cycle to enable the rapid testing of ideas, if not in online systems at least offline.', 'Because most machine learning projects deal with complex processes and are never truly finished, two major themes need to be addressed in every ML solution: continuous improvement and maintainability.', 'Continuous improvement plays a big part in machine learning projects, and it can be achieved through two intertwining routes:', 'For these reasons, when planning and budgeting for an ML project it‚Äôs a good idea to factor in at least one or two smaller sprints after the solution has been productionised.', 'Maintainability is the second central theme that must be addressed when planning an ML solution. Machine learning solutions are often built and maintained by small, dedicated teams, creating the challenge of navigating a trade-off between new development, continuous improvement, and maintenance work. This trade-off should not be taken lightly, as any development throughput will eventually lead to more maintenance work, which can come at the expense of new development or continuous improvement. This is why, when productionising the solution, the maintenance aspect should be specifically addressed and the solution should be created in a way that requires only low-level maintenance that any team member can perform in order to avoid locking people into maintenance roles.', 'A core concept that has greatly helped with the final push in machine learning solution projects is using the organization‚Äôs existing tools. This is important because the project value is often generated in cooperation with human end users (human-in-the-loop solutions), which in turn leads to process, workflow, and organisational changes. The use of existing tools increases the odds of successful process change as it eliminates one more moving part from the productionisation of the solution. In addition, end-users are more likely to use the solution if the tool is already familiar.', 'To create fast value with ML, do not start the project with the aim of building a data platform for all possible past, current, and future business cases. Your project can be part of a process where solutions are migrated to a new, better-managed data platform one use case at a time, without blocking the opportunity to start creating value from your data. This will allow the project team to extract more value from selected source system data rather than wasting time waiting for ETLs and API access to be built onto a centralized data platform that contains all possible data starting from the 1990s.', 'Many machine learning projects produce solutions designed to help experts or end users work, and real value is only generated when the solution is integrated with the process and end-user workflow. As the projects often create human-in-the-loop solutions, communication, testing, and materials are required for end-users. This means that the rollout of a solution needs to be well planned out, especially in terms of how it changes the value creation process.', 'If anything, communication and materials should be sent too frequently to end-users and stakeholders, starting right from the early phases of the project. This ensures that information about any workflow and business process changes that the solution will cause (or require) is disseminated sufficiently. If the solution changes the workflow, training should also be organized to ensure that users fully understand the solution and its intended use. Including actual end-users throughout this process makes it possible to establish a complete chain feedback loop and ensure that any process intricacies are considered in the final product.', 'Monitoring can be looked at from two perspectives. The more important of these is monitoring whether the ML solution is creating the desired impact ‚Äì and if not, why not. Secondly, as ML solutions are never fully ‚Äúready‚Äù, the model‚Äôs performance should be monitored closely to identify model drift and look out for changes in data or underlying behavior.', 'In some companies, there is still some disconnect between operations and data. Even if some visualization dashboards and ML are running, the organization may still not be running together with its data. In this kind of situation, it can be tempting to build ML adoption around some new data-centered business idea when starting on your ML journey. In most cases, I would strongly advise against this; I‚Äôve never seen a company where all of the core value streams are so data-intensive that there are no new ML business cases to explore that can improve operations. You should be wary about building ML adoption around new business models because, with so many other factors beyond ML project success influencing overall success, the ML case is often one of the smallest elements that need to succeed.']","['Multidisciplinary team', 'Service design', 'Business design', 'Data scientist', 'Data engineer X2', 'Business owner', 'Technical owner (can be the same person as the business owner)', 'the data and features', 'the model and how it works', 'the important features', 'the output of the model', 'the performance of the model', 'The first iteration of the machine learning solution might bring only modest results as there is only partial data available for training the models ‚Äì and perhaps some data will even be gathered through the first iteration itself.', ""As the solution produces more results and the functionality is better understood, new ideas for improvement are generated, which can multiply the original solution's effectiveness.""]"

In a volatile market, brands should move away from focusing on individual product excellence alone ‚Äì and instead adopt a broader framework going beyond individual offerings. By factoring in the larger network effect and needs of customers, society, ambitious partners and competitors, ecosystem thinking helps to consider broader possibilities, paving the way to a more resilient business and increased impact.', 'Ecosystem thinking is an alternative approach to delivering value which moves away from a traditional, linear focus on products to a more holistic understanding of how companies, customers and suppliers connect and the value they exchange.', 'However, to succeed and differentiate their offer in our current environment where disruption is the only constant, brands need more than product excellence in their repertoire. Pivoting quickly, building on existing efficiencies and assets, overcoming obstacles, and seizing new opportunities require a different strategy. Perhaps this is why in a McKinsey Analysis from 2020, we see 6 out of 7 top companies in the world (by market valuation) with digital ecosystems.', 'An ecosystem is a network of components (actors, services, platforms and/or products) that depend and fuel each other to deliver greater value together. Companies looking to adopt an ecosystem-based approach will come from many different starting places but will turn to ecosystems when looking to optimize processes internally or their own capabilities are limited or unable to create the needed customer facing value externally.', 'While customer-centricity lies at the heart of ecosystem thinking, an ecosystem approach extends beyond customer requirements to examine the entire matrix of relationships which connect a brand.', ""Netflix is an example of a successful ecosystem approach. At its core, Netflix is a content streaming platform - like hundreds of others. What differentiates Netflix from competitors is that this central streaming offering is supported by a wider network of partners, including content providers (producers and distributors), gaming companies, digital solutions providers and data sources. All of these moving parts align to drive engagement with the customer, underscoring Netflix's core mission and allowing it to constantly evolve in line with customer demands (for example, via the recent unveiling of an ad-funded tier created in partnership with Microsoft)."", 'The beauty of the ecosystem approach is that it works across all sectors. Futurice recently worked with a global machinery manufacturer to expand its offering beyond hardware into a digital ecosystem including partnerships and digital services. Futurice created a platform that facilitated easy data sharing in real-time, enabling a seamless user experience. The new data-driven ecosystem also encouraged a streamlined customer experience by optimizing the process of customer support. In the future, the ecosystem could provide services to extend the product life cycle and see how data can improve hardware R&D.', 'By digitizing manual processes, gaining a better understanding about tool and product data, the customer journey and the wider business landscape, we are helping our manufacturing client to take a step towards a circular economy. This shift also lays the groundwork for a more valuable, future-proof infrastructure that will allow them to meet changing influences across all their core segments.', 'The ecosystem approach works just as well in retail supply chain: A European supermarket chain client was good at optimizing its supply chain; it had a highly efficient process for sales and procurement. However, its enterprise value was stagnating. By working with them to take an ecosystem approach, we developed a sophisticated data platform which provided much greater visibility on what customers wanted from their local stores. This gave local store managers the flexibility to experiment with their local supply chain with the aim of delivering a highly personalized shopping experience to local customers. This increased flexibility and understanding of what sold also helped stores reduce food waste. This ecosystem project contributed to the supermarket chain doubling its enterprise value from 5 billion euros in 2018 to its current level of 10 billion euros.', ""In both examples, we worked with the clients to map a range of scenarios exploring far into the future. While the clients operated in unrelated sectors, they both came to similar conclusions. If they didn't do anything radically different to their competitors or the rest of the sector, they would stagnate."", ""Of course, shifting the business model towards an ecosystem approach is not something companies can do instantly. It's not without risk and requires careful planning. One of the advantages of embracing an ecosystem approach is that it can be done incrementally."", ""What's more, working in partnership with other companies in the ecosystem helps mitigate risk and share costs.

This way of working reduces the chances of sailing too close to the wind - for everyone involved.', 'In an SVS, we help you figure out what you need to become more resilient; mapping technologies, roadmaps, risks and ideas that will take your ship  in the right direction.', 'Our projects follow our own methodology, Lean Service Creation (LSC), which is a hands-on, practical way of working using agile, lean start-up and design thinking. LSC is built around a set of canvases that take you through the necessary steps for creating successful and resilient products and services that go beyond just a flash in the pan. You can put the canvases on the wall so everyone can see what you‚Äôre working on, which is an important step towards increased transparency and cultural change and doesn‚Äôt leave anyone in the team high and dry.', 'LSC is about doing things on the smallest possible scale first, so you don‚Äôt suddenly find yourself millions of euros into an investment whose value is still unknown. What comes with that is a constant feedback loop ‚Äì when your service has tested the waters and you have reliable feedback from service users, that gives you greater certainty and added resiliency.', ""LSC is a tool you can continue to use by yourself, giving you skills that will help you be resilient in the future, because co-creation empowers you to handle things yourself with your teams. This is another difference between a partnership and a hands-for-hire approach. It's common to see the creation of an artificial need for these services by providing a platform that clients don‚Äôt understand and when the external hands leave, the clients are dead in the water. \nIn a strategic partnership, however, the true north of the collaboration with clients is to provide value. You won‚Äôt be resilient if you‚Äôre reliant on externals in the long term."", 'It‚Äôs also about having a longer-term perspective and building resiliency into the organization, rather than just thinking about projects. For example, it‚Äôs important to create an environment that fosters all hands on deck, where the right people want to work and they won‚Äôt get burnt out. When we co-create, we‚Äôre not just providing technology and skills, we‚Äôre acting as a beacon on the market and giving a voice to different stakeholders, revealing the insights needed for future decision making and helping to establish a culture where change can happen. The end goal is resiliency in the face of rough seas, but what‚Äôs more important is the tools we provide to help you get there - because smooth seas don‚Äôt make good sailors.', 'Are you interested in building resilience in your organization?

Aside from improving company performance and client satisfaction, a customer-focused approach can help organizations stay relevant in an increasingly uncertain world.', 'The concept itself is fairly self-explanatory ‚Äì it‚Äôs about placing your customers first and building your products and services around their needs. So why do so many organizations pay lip service to customer centricity without realizing that they‚Äôre falling short? I had a chat with our experts on the impact of customer-centricity here at Futurice Sweden and this is what they had to say.', '‚ÄúCompanies often say they‚Äôre all about their customers ‚Äì but digging deeper, it‚Äôs sometimes surprising how little they involve them in product development, or how late in the process they start doing so,‚Äù explains Sonja Lakner, Managing Director at Futurice Sweden. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter what you assume they want; if you ask them directly, you might uncover something new. It could be something as simple as a multilingual organization with a tool that‚Äôs only available in one language ‚Äì this can be avoided if only someone thinks to ask.‚Äù', 'Arvid √Östr√∂m, Futurice Lead Designer, agrees, adding that some companies seem to see their customers as an inconvenience: ‚ÄúMany organizations prioritize internal efficiency over customer satisfaction ‚Äì they‚Äôre seeking the easiest or cheapest way to run the business instead of providing value.‚Äù', 'Anxiety over customers‚Äô reactions is another barrier to involving them when working on a product. Claes Kaarni, Head of Business Development, explains that ‚ÄúIt takes guts to get out of your comfort zone and start asking your customers questions. You might be afraid of taking up their time or of raising expectations for a service that might not end up launching. It‚Äôs important to trust that your customers will understand that the process is in their best interests ‚Äì or you might end up developing a service that they don‚Äôt even want to begin with.‚Äù', 'If you want to create something that has value for your customers, the logical place to start, and finish, is with them and their problems. According to Futurice Sweden Business Director Andreas Lindqvist, ‚ÄúWe need to zoom in on the customer‚Äôs problem and see them as collaborators in an iterative process, engaging them from the beginning and constantly coming back to them for input as we work to ensure that the solution meets their needs.‚Äù', 'For most organizations, this is more about a change of mindset than adopting specific tools or methods ‚Äì doing away with old ideas of what it means to be customer focused and having the courage to do things differently. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs challenging for organizations to change their mindset as they‚Äôve fallen into this default mode of making their own lives easier at the expense of focusing on their customers‚Äô needs. That‚Äôs a problem we can help them solve,‚Äù says Arvid.', ""‚ÄúOur clients‚Äô openness to changing their approach can make or break a project,‚Äù adds Sonja, ‚Äúso the earlier we come in, the more impact we can have as a strategic partner throughout the process, as they haven‚Äôt already over-invested in something that may not be the right solution. Companies need to learn to love the problem and not the solution, otherwise they'll lose sight of their customers‚Äô needs. The more fully integrated we are in their team, the more we can support them to keep that focus as it gives us greater visibility over their customers‚Äô problems.‚Äù"", 'There are also often other people within your organization who can help you have a more external point of view ‚Äì try talking to your customer service team, for example, as they hear directly from customers about their pain points every day. Everything starts with good communication; once you‚Äôve asked the right questions, you‚Äôll be ready to solve the right problems ‚Äì and then it‚Äôs time for action.', 'In addition to improving company performance and client satisfaction, a customer-focused approach can help organizations stay relevant in an increasingly uncertain world.', 'If we look at the companies that have been able to stand their ground through the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic instability, one thing a lot of them have in common is that their customers love their products or services so much that they don‚Äôt want to live without them.

', 'I‚Äôd say 90% of the reason I left Futurice was because of COVID ‚Äì working from home when you have an awesome company culture and people meant I was losing the best bit of working for the company. The other 10% was that, after seven years at Futurice, I thought it was time for a change. But in my new company I only ended up going to the office two or three times because of COVID, so I didn‚Äôt really get to know anyone beyond my team. Everything felt small and I missed the social interactions, which made it quite easy to come straight back to Futurice when they got in touch.', 'The people at Futurice are very smart and a lot of fun. We actually get things done, and everyone is really passionate about the things they‚Äôre interested in. This can lead to chaos, but it‚Äôs what you get when you have passionate people ‚Äì they want to change the world. I love the work I do and its impact on the world, but I know I could do it in lots of places. I came back to Futurice because Futuriceans feel like family.', 'In general, we don‚Äôt have too much structure in Futurice, and because of this we have people who can get things done.

Usually there‚Äôs nothing except themselves. I have made some major life changes a few times in my life and I always spend two to five years thinking I can‚Äôt make the big jump until I do it, and then it‚Äôs really simple. It‚Äôs only complex if you make it complex ‚Äì as humans we fear change and what it will bring us. Changing from Futurice Helsinki to Futurice Tampere was another quick decision ‚Äì a leap into the unknown. Me and my fianc√©e decided to move to Tampere with our child for a fresh start, even though we don‚Äôt have wider family around here. It‚Äôs turned out really well. I love Tampere and the fact we live near the centre of the city but also have forests nearby. It‚Äôs the best of both worlds: a 20 min trip to work and lots of wildlife in our backyard.', 'Leaving Futurice was, for me, a reaction to COVID and what was going on in the world. I have a habit of making big changes when the world is in flames! It‚Äôs one way to cope when life is not so good or the world is in a bad place; I‚Äôll change something major in my life, but of course it doesn‚Äôt change everything. Changing things is fun but it doesn‚Äôt fix your life as a whole ‚Äì you bring stuff with you, both good and bad.

In a world of BANI (brittle, anxious, non-linear, and incomprehensible), the future may seem clouded. When unexpected events happen, they can adversely affect society and businesses. Although the nature of these events can vary, it is absolutely essential to have a plan in place."", 'This is where foresight methods and strategic planning come into play. When thinking about foresight in a business setting, we are not trying to predict the future itself. However, what we are trying to do is to use foresight framework and use its\ninputs to formulate and guide the business strategies for the future. We will also look at how futures thinking and strategic foresight helps businesses plan for the future, innovate and create a more resilient future - taking control of their own future!', ""We can define the word 'foresight' as the ability to gather and process information about the possible future operating environment. It is often an unconscious process in human beings. In organisations, foresight is vital to effective planning as it allows the business to anticipate change."", 'We define methodology as systems for teaching, doing, or studying something. In terms of foresight methodology, it is an operational framework that can be used to see patterns in data more clearly. Therefore, we can say that foresight methodologies are frameworks that allow us to analyse data that structure our thinking about future events.', 'Understanding the world around us and being able to predict how changes might affect the organization, can provide immense advantages and business opportunities. By implementing successful business foresight, organisations can prepare for change and build strategies to cope with it.', ""If an organisation is able to integrate foresight methods into its everyday processes, it can protect itself from adverse events and give it a direction to move forward within its markets. For example, fruitful thinking can lead to the identification of gaps in the company's knowledge. By asking questions about a product or market's future development, organisations can see where they lack knowledge. This can prompt them to carry out additional research, which can lead to better products and marketing."", 'Another way in which foresight and futures thinking can help an organisation is that it can highlight areas where the company can grow. By predicting the way the product or market might develop, organisations can change their products to fit future requirements.', 'We can divide strategic methods into four stages according to A Generic Foresight Process Framework (Voros 2003):', 'This model indicates that foresight work precedes both strategic decision-making and strategic planning. Many organisations already adopt traditional strategy processes by gathering input, analysing and interpreting it.', 'However, work carried out in the foresight phase is often not done correctly. Only by adding this phase and sustaining it will there be improvements in organisations.', 'Learn more about the importance of strategic foresight ', 'Many businesses depend on innovation to keep moving their businesses forward and to increase their market share. However, in order to innovate, they must understand and predict what their customers want to buy now and in the future. Therefore, they need to have excellent insight and foresight in their customer base.', 'Learn more about organisation‚Äôs innovation capabilities and how to enhance those', 'Organisations use insight to understand how their customers perceive new products and services. With the help of foresight tools, such as trend analysis and implication mapping, organisations can prepare for the possible changes in for example consumer behaviour. Some examples of the latest developments are for example changing narratives on how people construct their adult lives and what kind of products and services they consume - tailored groceries, the rise in the consumption of plant-based products and sober curious movement to name a few.', 'The example of new innovative products and services that respond to the changing consumer needs, demonstrates how strategic planning emerges from future thinking. By using foresight methods to analyse future trends, organisations can create and implement strategic plans. In fact, the use of such strategies allows them to move organisations in different directions over a period of years.', 'This strategy can involve big changes within an organisation. Sometimes departments or entire companies need to be restructured. This can be a painful process and requires sensitive change management. By employing effective change management strategies, companies can make the process of change less stressful for their employees and, ultimately, build a stronger organisation.', 'Strategic planning is vital in our ever-changing world. Companies need to anticipate changes and adapt to them. If a comprehensive strategic plan is laid out, it allows the company to define measurable goals. This, in turn, gives them a way of measuring their progress and assessing how well the plans are working. By continually assessing their plans, they can make rapid changes if needed.', 'Exploring the future can prove invaluable in the business world. The ability to anticipate what your customers want can make the difference between success and failure. Many companies over the years have lost their market share and competitive advantage because they have not been able to innovate, or they have missed a trend by mistake (making a conscious decision not to follow a trend is part of  strategic planning). Therefore, it is vital that companies utilize systematic corporate foresight and strategic planning methods.', 'Organizations can benefit from creating a process of foresight thinking, which leads to strategic planning.

In order to future-proof themselves and navigate this volatile situation, businesses and organizations need to figure out how to deal with uncertainty by developing new ways of thinking and working. Digital transformation can play a critical role in helping them do this. Read on.', 'The silver lining to all this doom and gloom is that a world with an uncertain future is a breeding ground for creativity, and using this to harness innovation can make companies more resilient to the resulting adversity. On the flipside, there are lots of things that can hold them back from enabling digital transformation, from a lack of tools, data and expertise to a limited budget and strong employee pushback.', 'According to Loch, DeMeyer and Pich, there are no safe havens anymore. Uncertainty is pervasive and originates from a variety of factors: the breakdown of trust in financial institutions, the global nature of the recession, the interconnectedness of markets, geographies and companies, the rise of new industries and sudden swings in demand. Extremely unpredictable events that have a major impact, known as black swans, could destabilize any existing balance in a matter of days.', 'In addition to political, economical and social instability, disruptive technologies are a key driver of uncertainty. The continuum of digital disruption started as far back as 1950, but the change it brings still seems to become exponentially greater and quicker with each cycle. And its effect goes beyond our external environment, too. The Digital Disruption of Industry Consortium tells us that the latest developments in artificial intelligence will have a deep impact on our very values and existence as a race.', 'It‚Äôs not just digital developments that cause market disruption though; emerging supply chains, business models and production methods can also place an organization in a position where it needs to adapt if it is to survive. Regardless of the nature of the threats, a digitally immature company will find it impossible to maintain its market position in this rapidly evolving ecosystem. Adopting an effective approach to future-proofing enables organizations to swiftly rethink their models, service creation and tech architecture as required.', 'To stay afloat in a volatile market, an organization must respond with innovative ways of building resiliency. This can involve using future thinking and strategic foresight to imagine and plan for different future scenarios. It also involves enabling digital transformation within the organization in order to build better predictive models using data and prepare for whatever the future holds by being ready to adopt beneficial digital technologies. As digital has become the backbone of commerce, with organizations relying on external tools as well as developing their own, a digital strategy is not only a necessity, but also quite often a contributory factor in business success in the form of digital sales, services and other capabilities.', 'Potential uncertainties can all somehow be tackled through digital means. Undergoing digital transformation will also ensure that your organization is equipped with the capabilities it needs and give you an internal strength that you can always rely on, calling on external expertise when needed to enact rapid changes. Working in an agile and flexible way is important, as settling on particular directions, vendors, technologies or models will ultimately hinder your ability to react when change arises.', 'A company may face many barriers to digital transformation, from practical concerns such as a lack of time, money, resources or expertise to having an organizational structure, culture or overall strategy that is not set up to foster digitalisation. Overcoming these barriers is essential to dealing with uncertainty in business ‚Äì but how do we go about this?', 'Many of the issues can be addressed by improving operational efficiency, which frees up resources to be redeployed in the implementation of new strategies. Digital transformation is no walk in the park though ‚Äì it requires a complete cultural overhaul and a new way of thinking, and it costs a lot of money too. To make it work, everyone in the organization has to be on board, so it can be a hard sell when starting from scratch because people are often resistant to change.', 'We‚Äôve put a lot of effort into researching proactive strategies for managing uncertainty and using our expertise to help companies equip themselves to solve any future problems independently.', 'In some cases, this can be as simple as educating staff and making sure that internal departments and processes are aligned with the company‚Äôs thinking, while also reshaping the legacy digital footprint and ensuring that there are no dependencies that will slow things down.

For example, if you want to travel from point A to point B on a bicycle and you look up your route on a travel planner, the chances are you‚Äôll find the shortest or the quickest option. But what if you could find the safest route to get where you need to be? Our recent Safe Route project shows how revisiting our assumptions ‚Äì even with an incomplete dataset ‚Äì can deliver innovative solutions and worthwhile outcomes, while also revealing some of the roadblocks to digital innovation.', 'People are being encouraged to cycle for a variety of reasons, from personal health to reducing congestion and helping the environment, but every year in Sweden around 2,000 cyclists are severely injured in traffic.

Safe Route was conceived as a new way to think about travel, a free service that prioritises safety over speed.', 'Safe Route uses data from STRADA (Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition), a database of road traffic accidents and injuries that occur on Swedish roads, which is maintained by the Swedish Transport Agency. You usually need to be an academic or part of a governmental agency to access this data, which highlights an issue that will be recognised by many companies ‚Äì data that would be useful for innovation company-wide (or even more broadly) gets stuck in a silo and isn‚Äôt easily shared. Freeing data internally so it‚Äôs available for innovation is essential for progress, but we should go even further to remove roadblocks to accessing data between organisations.', 'Although companies gather a huge volume of data, very little of it is routinely shared externally ‚Äì even data that isn‚Äôt business critical and could benefit society. When companies and authorities are open to sharing their data, there‚Äôs no obvious platform for them to do so currently, and there are no commonly agreed standards for data collection and attribution. While the STRADA data allowed us to take potential traffic hazards such as intersections, left turns and roundabouts into account, we would have liked to add much more data into our model, such as weather, road surface quality and how busy different streets are at different times of day. Solutions such as Safe Route depend on large amounts of high-quality data to run predictive models so that artificial intelligence can identify where accidents are most likely to happen. The opportunities for innovation that will be unlocked by increased data sharing are limitless ‚Äì we can achieve amazing things when we work together.', 'While Safe Route can suggest a potentially safer journey based on the number of accidents and where they occurred, we‚Äôve not been able to provide the definitive safest route as there are still too many factors that we don‚Äôt have the data for. That said, we do know that crossings and roundabouts are the interchanges most commonly involved in the accident statistics, and we know that the city centre has the highest density of accidents. Based on this it‚Äôs reasonable to assume that a crossing in the centre of Stockholm might not be as safe as other potential routes.

Sustainability data can  include data on emissions from own operations or from the value chain, energy usage, raw material life cycle emissions, etc. Increasingly, companies are also measuring and communicating the impact from emission reductions. Due to the nature of the data, managing, understanding and generating insights from it may be challenging.', 'For industrial companies, sustainability is usually a function of efficient operations, well managed supply chains, clear leadership prioritization for sustainability and concrete activities to mitigate and compensate for emissions. However, in order to successfully establish a baseline for sustainability, or be able to improve it, companies must be able to first understand sustainability from a data point of view.', 'We frequently work with our industrial clients to see how they can improve the management of sustainability data and ability to improve sustainability for themselves or their customers, through insights provided by the data.

Many have, however, been tailored for specific industries (e.g. real estate) or use cases (data aggregation or analysis, compliance and ESG reporting). Options include tech start ups and scale ups, such as Planetly or Persefoni, and emission tracking tools offered by industrial service providers as an add on service, like DHL or Geodis.', 'Tech giants like Salesforce that already have a place within the enterprise software ecosystem have also begun to release solutions and modules specifically addressing various sustainability insight related use cases, such as accurately tracking product emissions throughout the lifecycle.', 'For industrial companies, the choice isn‚Äôt easy.

Transitioning from working asynchronously and integrating changes late in the process to working synchronously and integrating continuously has not been without pain. However, in the end, the benefits have far outweighed the detriments.', 'Disclaimer: similar to other ways of working, both pair and mob programming are known to elicit heated discussions. Some people feel they represent precisely how they want to work, while others detest them as no-good practices. I attempt to share my points of view given my background, experience, and context following the Just Sharing principle, which means the solutions I describe here may or may not work for you.', ""If you're not familiar with mob programming ‚Äî also known as ensemble programming ‚Äî here's an accurate definition from its early pioneers:"", '""All the brilliant people working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and on the same computer."" ‚Äî Woody Zuill, mobprogramming.org', ""In the simplest terms, mob programming is pair programming with at least one additional developer. Granted, the last two points in Zuill's definition are debatable in the era of hybrid working. Nevertheless, it's the opposite of a well-known software development process where brilliant minds work on their tasks, when, where, and how they choose."", ""But why would that last sentence carry any problems? Isn't autonomy a crucial trait of self-organising teams? You're not wrong there, dear reader. However, a fully autonomous scatter-gather software development model has its frequently observed downsides, which I describe below."", 'In many software projects, working features in isolation and integrating the pieces later is the standard way of working. A team of developers, each with their areas of specialisation, are staffed together to optimise resource utilisation. The team then meets to plan the features for the next iteration together with a lead developer or a product owner. The team adds client feature requests to the iteration backlog, estimates them, prioritises them, and splits them into multiple tasks.', ""Up until now, the team has been working conveniently together. However, next, the team usually ends the meeting and kicks off the iteration work by dividing the tasks. First, developers write features that satisfy the task's acceptance criteria and commit their work under feature branches. When done, they open pull requests to the project repository's mainline. Other developers review the pull requests before those are merged into the mainline. After merging, the developers pick the next tasks from the backlog to work on."", 'Soloing based on feature branching and pull requests has established itself as a status quo in many teams, with developers often unable to see any other alternative. One culprit is that many developers I‚Äôve spoken to perceive pull requests as the only mechanism for code review, which is far from the truth.', 'The problem with soloing is how it negatively affects the flow efficiency by contributing to the following types of process waste (muda in Lean):', '1. Delays', '2. Queues', '3. Defects', '4. Big Batches', '5. Overproduction', '6. Rework', ""Process delays emerge when the system is already utilised at its maximum capacity and can't accept new work. If all the developers are working on their tasks, they should finish them before starting new ones. However, quality processes dictate that it's impossible to complete a task without it passing through a quality gate, which in software development is often a code review."", ""Therefore, developers must also review the work of others. They must drop their current task, accept a new task, complete it, and finally return to their original task. When this context-switching is repeated multiple times a day, the team's throughput suffers and the lead time of a single task increases. What was previously estimated as the task's duration is no longer even remotely accurate. Some developers realise the effect of delays and add the necessary buffer to their estimates, but that hardly solves the bottleneck problem."", ""In lean software development, lead time is how long it takes for a task to move from the backlog to being done, and throughput is the average number of tasks the team can complete in a unit of time. Here's a helpful description of the terms using tacos as examples."", 'When developers hand off their tasks to a review, they should wait for peer feedback before going forward. However, the system often has little to no capacity to serve the developer immediately due to delays. So, to feel productive (or busy), developers take on the next task while waiting for review, which creates queues ‚Äî often referred to as inventory or work-in-progress ‚Äî in the system. This further overloads the system with demand for capacity, again increasing the lead time.', 'Suppose you have participated in one of those team meetings where developers are begging for someone to drop whatever they are working on and review their code. In that case, you are familiar with the queue problem.', ""When developers are invited to review the code they haven't written, they seek to understand the context and decisions the code author has made. Authors can facilitate reviews by keeping batches small and adding helpful remarks for the reviewer. However, it's impossible to know what has been going on inside the author's head when they wrote that particular line of code. Indeed, numerous pieces of advice have been written to optimise the experience of asynchronous code reviews. Yet, most fail to understand that code review is a synchronous activity often requiring face-to-face communication."", 'In the worst case, the reviewer could focus on low-hanging fruits and leave review comments about styling, function lengths, naming, and whitespace, to name but a few. While these are crucial points for high-quality code, focusing solely on the style issues also allows more severe logical defects to pass the quality gate unnoticed. A humorous yet accurate joke on the subject goes as follows:', '""Never seen a pull request over 500 changed lines that didn\'t look good to me.""', 'Integrating changes late from feature branches to the mainline is the net sum of the problems mentioned above. Suppose we survive the nasty merge conflicts arising from long-running feature branches. The other common reasons for defects found in production are big batches ‚Äî the size of the release.', ""When the team has been working on several tasks concurrently, their changes are often intertwined, so it's impossible to release one feature without the other safely. Moreover, when the batch sizes grow, it's increasingly difficult to differentiate what change caused which defect and reverting the release becomes an all-or-nothing feat. In contrast, when changes are released frequently in small batches, it's easy to discern their impact and roll back or release a new fix in case of defects."", 'Delays and queues inherently contribute to larger batch sizes, which are also orders of magnitude more difficult to review properly without context. Thus, the risk of releasing defects through shallowly inspected code grows higher.', 'As a remedy, teams often react to increased error rates in production by adding more quality gates, which unfortunately do not resolve the underlying problems. In some cases, teams may even become afraid to ship frequently and begin to hold back on releases, thus skyrocketing the batch sizes even further. The catch-22 of big batches has started.', 'While developers work in feature branches, they are often tempted to add one more feature because they foresee an imaginary situation in the future where they might need it. It‚Äôs interesting how we developers are bad at estimates, yet we are always so confident we need to have this feature for the future. Unfortunately, those extra features are rarely needed and only harm the flow with delays and a higher chance for defects. More code equals more errors squared.', 'For many developers, overproduction is a familiar situation. When you hit the flow state of mind and the creative juice is flowing, it takes considerable willpower to restrain yourself.', 'Perhaps the most familiar waste among developers is the notorious code review ping-pong. The developer opens a pull request, submits it for review, and comes back later to fix the issues found in the review. If the code review happens in an online tool, the chance of communication failures often results in a substantial rework loop.', 'Mob programming eliminates delays and queues by effectively limiting the work-in-progress to one. When all the brilliant developers are working together on the same task, there is no need to hand off the task outside the mob because quality inspection is immediate. Rework is still possible, but it happens less because the code review ping-pong has become a thing of the past.', 'Having multiple eye pairs scrutinising the code being written, the code quality tends to stay higher, and defects are discovered more quickly. Participants of the mob also have the responsibility to restrain each other from adding unnecessary features, thus avoiding overproduction.', 'When the task is done, it can be released immediately to production, given the automated delivery pipeline passes. Thus, the team can deliver the smallest possible batches multiple times daily. Incidentally, mob programming is also close to the definition of DevOps since the mob can be responsible for designing, implementing, testing, and releasing features without depending on others.', 'Because the team throughput grows and the lead time of a single task drops lower, the system has better responsiveness to new work. After completing the current task, the mob can rapidly shift to work on the next most important task, whether a defect in production or a new client need.', ""I admit these ideas sound too good to be true. Indeed, several people I've been talking with have described their first experiences with pair and mob programming as entering a parallel dimension where the work flows naturally in the leanest possible way."", 'Critics of mob programming often reject it with arguments about how ineffective it is. To an inexperienced or non-technical person, people working as Zuill defined earlier may seem peculiar and wasteful.', ""So, let's define what mob programming is not."", ""It's not many people watching one person doing all the work. As a rule of thumb, everyone in the mob participates equally. In a typical mob setup, drivers write the code while navigators help the driver overcome obstacles and direct the grand scheme of things. The driver's role is rotated frequently ‚Äî for example, every 10 minutes ‚Äî so they can relax their brains before taking on the navigator's duties."", ""It's not many people doing the work of one. A misconception rooted in soloing where every developer should work on one task at all times. While mob programming, the team doesn't assign personal tasks unless they involve researching a topic or drawing design diagrams, for example. Instead, the mob starts and finishes tasks together, sharing the code ownership and transferring knowledge as they learn."", ""It's not a full-day meeting. By definition, meetings are a passive form of work where you discuss the work before being able to complete it. Understandably, many developers have a passionate fury towards meetings. Talking about work while not doing it is ineffective. While mob programming, we talk about work while doing it, which is effective. Unfortunately, the hybrid work has come with many online meetings that are here to stay. Still, distributed teams need to communicate using whatever tools are necessary. If you can mob co-located in the office, I recommend that instead of meeting online."", ""It's not only for extroverts and neurotypicals. We can make the mob programming sessions more comfortable for introverts by allowing them extra breaks and remembering to ask how they would solve a problem if they hesitate to express their opinions aloud. Naturally, the more the mob works together and learns to know each other better, the safer they feel while communicating. On the other hand, extroverts can often take the helm with their views while navigating. To counter that, we must lay out clear rules for communication: treat everyone in the team equally and respect everyone's unique needs."", ""Our project involves an unfamiliar business domain related to data science and low-level device programming, which I'm not allowed to disclose further due to an NDA. Suffice it to say; this is not a typical Futurice portfolio project where we deliver a B2C web application for the client. Because of the domain complexity, everyone needs to amplify learning as efficiently as possible."", 'However, our learning was slow due to many workflow issues.', ""Our initial ways of working followed the earlier described scatter-gather model. We were three developers ‚Äî two from Futurice and one from the client side ‚Äî working on three or more tasks simultaneously across multiple repositories. If you've read this far, you can probably guess what problems we had, but allow me to explain."", 'We created busywork: lots of work but poor results: high output but low outcomes.', ""Despite our best planning efforts, tasks took several days to complete because the code review process was a bottleneck. In addition, inspecting the code days after it was written made it nearly impossible for the reviewer to understand the surrounding context and the author's decisions. This, in turn, delayed the delivery. Unsurprisingly, the most often used phrases in code review comments were:"", '""Can you explain to me what this line of code does here?""', '""Can you add a comment here to explain the code?""', '""Why was this line removed?""', '""Should we use function X instead?""', 'Before advancing further, we also required sign-offs through approved code reviews from our lead developer. Because the lead developer was fully utilised both with their tasks and reviews, the feedback loops grew incredibly long. Returning to a code you wrote earlier became tremendously painful. When switching context from another task to a previous one, the thoughts often were:', '""What was I thinking then?""', '""How should I improve my code now?""', '""I need to complete the other task because I need code from that feature branch.""', ""We had severe knowledge gaps due to knowledge not being shared daily. As a result, I couldn't help my colleague with their task, nor could they help me with mine."", 'Taking time off for vacation or sick leave was risky because the work might be stalled. No one could continue my work without first spending significant time inspecting the code I had written.', ""Ultimately, our team of consultants and in-house developers did not feel like a team. We didn't know each other very well and met only once or twice a day during meetings. It's no overstatement that we were not a team. We were pairs of hands, each having our small mission instead of working towards a common goal."", ""Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, I've struggled writing code in solitude. Not because I wouldn't have been skilled enough to work alone, but because it simply feels duller. Not having a colleague to talk to or invite to check out a line of code removes all the social aspects of programming. So it was only me, my remote office, and the clicks and clacks of my mechanical keyboard echoing in the hallways."", 'Developers often praise the positive effects of deep focus on remote working, which leaves the adverse effects underlooked. For example, I am incredibly grateful to work in the office with my team again, yet I would never sign a contract prohibiting me from working remotely.', 'As the clich√©d movie narrative goes, we had to do something.', 'Following the poorly optimised development process for a couple of months, in frustration, I suggested we experiment with working in pairs and mobs instead of always working alone. The idea was greeted with curiosity. Yet there was also slight hesitation in the air due to the lack of experience.', 'Fast-forward six months to the present day, and we have onboarded one new developer to the team through mob programming and lost a lot of problems. Oh, and gained new, but more about those later.', ""Due to the team working only on one task at a time, we don't do context-switching. As a result, we can't be interrupted to review the code of others when the single task at hand is right in front of us. Thus, there are no interruptions or the immeasurable pain of recalibrating your brain to work on one task, jump to another, and finally, get back to the original task."", ""We don't have to wait for our code to be reviewed because the review happens instantly after a single line of code has been written, if not earlier."", ""However, instant code reviews don't automatically mean we always produce perfectly infallible solutions that are worshipped on the walls of heavenly mausoleums."", ""We often need to improve our earlier code, so we simply return to it and conduct the necessary refactoring. We don't ask anyone's permission to refactor our code because it's our duty and responsibility as professional software engineers to keep the codebase in mint condition. As a result of refactoring at every opportunity, the design of our software is constantly improving in short iterations."", ""We have also applied behaviour-driven development (BDD) to our process, which makes it easy to verify whether regression defects appeared after the latest changes. With BDD, we define the application's initial state, actions, and post-conditions of our logic and write it as an automated test before implementing the logic. If you've encountered Given-When-Then or *Arrange-Act-Assert*methods while writing tests, you're familiar with BDD."", ""Practising mob programming together ensures I know as much of the project's design and codebase as my colleagues do. Consequently, I don't have to stress about having a vacation or taking a day off due to sickness. Yes, there are unknown unknowns, but all the known knowns and unknowns are distributed across the hivemind."", ""Furthermore, efficient knowledge transfer allows me to come back refreshed after a month, knowing that my team's work has not stalled because of something I forgot to tell on Friday afternoon before logging off. It's a glorious sensation you must experience before fully appreciating it."", 'Thanks to mob programming, we are always synchronised. So if we need to demonstrate our solutions to stakeholders, not everyone has to be present because our hivemind is perfectly aware of the fruits of our labour.', 'You might say: ""A-ha! But you\'re always in a meeting because of mob programming!"". To which I say: yes, our so-called meetings have become more efficient.', 'Our daily stand-up meetings transformed from the old-fashioned pattern of reporting the individual statuses towards planning what we should do today as a team to achieve our sprint goals. Of course, we still have sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives, but those have become easier because we communicate and collaborate better.', 'Our branching model transformed from long-running (more than a day) feature branches to trunk-based development (or continuous integration, if you prefer) using a shared development branch. Of course, we are still using pull requests but only for those cases where we want to trigger a release pipeline of our software.', 'Our mainline branch triggers a canary release pipeline, and pushing a tag to version control triggers the stable release pipeline. Today, we release new preview versions daily, and stable versions whenever we are confident that features satisfy user needs.', 'In the future, we might stretch our branching patterns further and commit directly to the mainline. For now, committing to a shared development branch accompanied by daily merges to the mainline has worked well enough for us.', 'The more we learn from each other and our domain while mob programming, the sharper our estimates become. But, naturally, estimating stories and tasks too accurately is still a significant process waste, so we avoid overdoing it.', 'By estimating, we merely want to measure how much work we can take for the next sprint while still feeling good about ourselves. Agreeing and committing to a common sprint goal feels more meaningful when the team works together.', 'One of the unexpected benefits of mob programming was how we began to regard failures. During one week, we felt very productive and completed one task after another. However, we conducted more thorough testing the following week at the client premises and noticed our application was not working as expected.', 'We simply had understood the requirements wrong and had to fix the implementation during the week postponing the upcoming release to a later date. On another note, it shows well how wasteful measuring only velocity is. You can always run at full speed in the wrong direction.', 'Surprisingly, we only had ourselves as a team to blame for the failure. So instead of pointing fingers at one developer, we gently pointed the fingers at ourselves, embraced the learning effect, and got to work again.', 'But, of course, even while working alone, we were not shaming each other over the defects we\'ve allowed to accumulate. Nevertheless, even in psychologically safe teams, passive-aggressive speech like ""this is Joe\'s code, why don\'t you ask him about it"" can easily hurt morale and endanger motivation.', ""Tight collaboration nurtures empathy and team spirit. Of course, you become more vulnerable when mob programming with others daily, but that's only our soft skills evolving. We, the developers, need to be people first and rock stars last."", ""As I indicated earlier, mob programming is neither a silver bullet nor a best practice. Therefore, it's fair to expect that transforming our work also brought new problems. However, we have discovered root causes for most of these thanks to agile retrospectives."", 'Remote Code Sharing\nWorking in a hybrid model where one of our team members lives in another city poses the problem of communication and keyboard sharing. However, these are not issues when everyone is in the same space.', 'For sharing the code, we have been using VS Code Live Share, which, in all irony, works surprisingly poorly on Windows compared to, e.g. macOS. Typically, signing in to the Live Share service takes a long time, and you might have to restart the whole IDE a couple of times before being able to share a session or join one. So the most reliable solution is restarting the software before starting to work.', ""We have also looked into the mob.sh tool as a solution for doing fast driver-navigator handovers with Git. However, for now, Live Share hasn't been a major enough problem to motivate the switch."", ""For video calls, we've been using our client's Microsoft Teams with a conference speaker setup in our project room. Calls work decently with occasional drops in audio quality (hello, Mr Robot Voice), but when you turn on your webcam, all the CPU resources are sometimes entirely drained."", 'There is no good group call feature other than calling each member in the direct messaging group, which is slightly noisy. So, to facilitate our communication, we have created a 24/7 video call, which acts as an open discussion space similar to what Huddles are for Slack.', 'While working on tasks, we often experience a powerful sensation of flow, which holds tight to our harm and hindrance.', 'Once, we were working on a particularly challenging task for several hours straight and forgot to take breaks. So, after calling it a day, it was hard for me to enjoy my free time due to massive exhaustion. After this, we promptly aimed for more discipline and agreed that all of us are responsible for watching the clock and suggesting we take a short break away from the computer at least once per hour.', ""We still tend to work late. We are not at our best when the clock hits four in the afternoon. But fortunately, even the most giant shark becomes a timid fry after a good night's sleep, and we resolved yesterday's issues early in the following day. Flow and deep focus are often touted as essentials for producing quality software, but in our experience, their disadvantages often exceed their benefits if we're not careful."", 'We also noticed that sometimes our attention tends to wander off. People who were not driving started browsing the Internet instead of participating. So, we agreed to mute our notifications, define goals for each session (e.g. one task completed, have a break), and allow everyone equal time to drive and navigate others.', ""As a rule of thumb, we have been using 10 minutes as a typical rotation length, after which the driver becomes a navigator, and the next driver is picked. However, the strict time limit often feels too rigid. So we have also experimented with ping-pong rotations in test-driven development (TDD) style, where one person writes a test, and another makes it pass before writing the next test. Sometimes it's better than a fixed timer, and as a bonus, it forces us to design our solutions through tests, which helps maintainability."", 'If the acceptance criteria for a given task are not set in stone, it leaves room for interpretation. Hence, we often debate the best way forward, which does not feel productive.', 'In a sense, not feeling productive is not a bad thing, though. A common problem in systems optimising for resource utilisation is that you start feeling guilty if you don‚Äôt have active work at all times. However, the feeling of being unproductive doesn‚Äôt mean you are unproductive. In mob programming, we spend a significant portion of our time learning instead of following a concrete to-do list, which adds to the guilt trip. Why am I here talking when I could be productive at my task? It‚Äôs hard to unlearn it, but we must try.', ""As part of getting to know the unfamiliar business domain, we have encountered a few packages whose usage hasn't been most developer-friendly. When you don't understand how external code behaves, a mob pointing fingers at the screen, reading documentation, and asking questions is not the most productive way to solve it. Occasionally, we split the mob into two pairs or go solo to research libraries and possible alternatives. When someone finds a viable solution, we regroup and present our findings before continuing together."", 'We are using Azure DevOps and its pipeline solution for delivering our application. In addition, we strive to follow good CI/CD practices: running the whole test suite before pushing to trunk, keeping the pipeline definitions readable, leveraging caching efficiently, and ensuring no redundant tasks are run.', ""Unfortunately, Azure Pipelines is not particularly better when compared to other CI/CD solutions in the market. Often, we make a change, wait for the pipeline to trigger and watch for any errors to report. When the pipelines take several minutes to run, it's clear this is not the best use of the mob's time."", 'Adopting and embracing tight collaboration and collective code ownership through mob programming instead of the loose collaboration and divided ownership of soloing has been immensely rewarding. Of course, mob programming has its clear ups and downs, but thanks to our agile mindset, we have quickly discovered any pitfalls in retrospect and adjusted our methods for the better.', 'When our shared journey began, we were a group of specialists with people experienced in the frontend, backend, data science, and UI development. After extensive periods of mob programming, we have built a generalist full-stack team where everyone can cover for each other in case of absence.', ""Years ago, I studied Lean & Theory of Constraints, which didn't stick with me until I began to practise mob programming. I now understand better one of its key revelations:"", '""Any improvement not at the constraint is an illusion."" ‚Äî fortelabs.co', 'Any attempt to improve the asynchronous code review experience is an illusion if your constraint is the long queue of pull requests. Any attempt to throw in more people is an illusion if your constraint is a large work-in-progress count. Any attempt to increase the batch size and release less often is an illusion if your constraint is defective releases. Any attempt to fiddle with story points is an illusion if your constraint is large and unrefined user stories.', 'The only way to improve the situation is to find the constraint and drive a stake through its heart. Teams practising mob programming effectively also tend to remove constraints easily.', ""Finally, I'm closing this article with a famous Systems Thinking quote from Russell L. Ackoff, which is particularly fit for mob programming:"", 'A system is never the sum of its parts; it‚Äôs the product of their interaction.', ""Likewise, in software development, the best products are not born by summing up the team's work but by multiplying their interactions.

This is putting pressure on the organization‚Äôs innovation capabilities and setting the bar higher to innovate by the day. By using tools like the [ean futures toolkit, companies can gain a competitive edge over their rivals, which can lead to a successful future.', 'Since the end of World War II, manufacturing industries and technology, in general, have changed at lightning speed. In particular, there have been major technological advances in the fields of telecommunications and computing. These developments have completely revolutionized our lives by facilitating how we communicate, share information, and do business. In fact, the rise of the internet has altered all aspects of our lives. It has allowed businesses to move online and make their products available worldwide.', 'The speed of change in the modern world means that businesses need to work hard to keep up. Therefore, it‚Äôs essential that they try to understand how future changes will affect them. A study by Ren√© Rohrbeck and Menes Etingue Kum states that businesses that are future-prepared are, on average, 33% more profitable than their rivals. By using corporate foresight, businesses can build future thinking processes into their everyday methods. The result is that these corporate foresight abilities allow the business to continually anticipate change and be more resilient.', 'We can define ‚Äòforesight‚Äô as the ability to make judgments about what might happen in the future and to make plans based on these judgments. In the corporate arena, using foresight methodologies allow businesses to collect and analyze inputs of data, analyze and interpret that data using a systematic framework and plan as well as strategize for the future accordingly.', 'Using business foresight methods lets the company look at the future from different angles by using scientific methods from different fields and for instance combining quantitative and qualitative data. The objective is not to predict the future but to reframe probable outcomes so that they can be evaluated. The end goal is to highlight areas where there are gaps in knowledge and where innovation can occur.', '‚ÄòHorizon scanning‚Äô is a popular tool that is often used for corporate foresight as a method from future studies. Horizon scanning detects and assesses emerging trends and gathers information on potentially important developments. Part of this scanning process involves competitive intelligence and technology intelligence.', 'When undertaking competitive intelligence gathering, companies acquire information on their competitors, customers, and markets to look for trends and recent developments. With technology intelligence gathering, the aim is to identify threats and opportunities in the technology world. All of this information is analyzed and used to create strategic plans.', 'Another example of a popular future study method and corporate foresight tool is ‚Äòbackcasting‚Äô, where a team starts from the point of a desirable future, and they work back from there to the present. They see how each step affects the organization or product so that they can define each point that will take them to their desired goal. Backcasting shouldn‚Äôt be confused with forecasting which involves the prediction of the future, which is not the goal of foresight.', 'Gathering data and analyzing it is a very useful process. However, a vital part of the process is deciding what to do with the results. The organization needs to use the findings to put in place strategic plans that can lead to company success.', 'Strategic plans can be either short-term, medium-term or long-term and can involve gradual shifts in direction or a complete restructuring. The ultimate purpose of these plans is to move the organization into the best position for the future, allowing it to innovate so that it can keep up with the market.', 'This room to innovate is a crucial part of planning. For example, if a new technology is under development, a company might need to recruit specialists in that area. Therefore, the strategic plan needs to include the budget for new staff, space for them to work, and any other additional requirements.', 'A comprehensive strategic plan allows a company to set out clear goals and deliverables. These goals give the organization a way of measuring the progress and success of that plan. By having clear milestones, they can judge if everything is going well or if the plan needs to be changed. This ensures that the company is responsive and flexible, so opportunities for further change are not missed.', 'Having good ideas is a really useful thing, but what happens if you can never implement them? An organization‚Äôs innovation capabilities are really its ability to generate new ideas and put them into practice. If a company is slow to innovate, it can mean that it will fall behind its competitors and lose its market share. Therefore, successful organizations must have the ability to adapt to change quickly. Using foresight methodologies, future needs can be anticipated and structures can be put in place to capitalize on these changes.', 'If a company fosters an environment that encourages innovation, it will be able to adapt to the surrounding changes. Companies that encourage innovation often have open communication channels between departments, encourage a creative climate, and promote innovative thinking. They use futures thinking techniques and scenario analysis to highlight areas where innovation opportunities can be created. By using effective innovation management, they increase their innovation capabilities and create a more resilient company.', 'Learn more about organisation‚Äôs innovation capabilities and how to enhance those', ""In today's competitive world, companies need every advantage they can gain to get ahead of their competitors ‚Äî and to stay ahead.

This blog post takes a look at the actions we have taken to support our employees‚Äô mental well-being in the workplace, to help you reflect on your organization‚Äôs situation and whether the same approach could help you tackle the same issues.', 'A look at some hard data shows our mental health crisis has reached an alarming level: around one in seven people globally have one or more mental or substance use disorders. In Germany, 27.8% of the adult population is affected by mental health disorders each year, and in Finland ‚Äì which has the highest estimated incidence of mental disorders in the EU ‚Äì close to 1 in 5 are affected.', 'This means that mental health problems occur just as frequently as other common illnesses such as high blood pressure. Between 1999 and 2019, the number of working days lost by employees due to mental health problems more than tripled in Germany. In Finland, the lost productivity added up to an estimated 5.3% of the country‚Äôs GDP in 2016, much higher than the EU average of 4%.', ""At the same time, mental disorders remain a taboo. A survey by the German Federal Ministry of Labor shows that only half of people would tell their friends about a diagnosis. Due to Finland's global reputation as the happiest country on earth, young people feel less inclined to speak up about their struggles, and some even feel that their struggles are invalid due to where they live."", 'At work, 82% of employees diagnosed with mental illness kept their difficulties secret from management, mainly due to fears of a negative impact on their career.', 'Most mental illnesses go untreated. This is due to several reason, ranging from the feeling of not being entitled to treatment, to the stigmatization of the topic and the fear of negative consequences, as well as inner beliefs ‚Äì such as seeing asking for help as a sign of weakness.', 'In Finland, individuals with mental health issues must be able to access treatment within three months of the need for treatment being confirmed. Getting access to therapy in Germany can be a lengthy process: currently, the average waiting time for a therapy spot paid for by the health insurance is 22 weeks ‚Äì that‚Äôs five and a half months. The demand for therapy has grown enormously, especially during the pandemic ‚Äì in some cases there has been a 40% increase in inquiries for practices last year, per the German Psychotherapists‚Äô Association.', 'The list of eye-opening (and kind of shocking) mental health facts and figures could go on forever. So the question is: is there also good news? Yes, there is!', 'One positive trend is that today, society promotes conversation about mental health. The Covid-19 pandemic helped destigmatize mental health problems and distress because external circumstances made it more acceptable to talk about problems.', 'For example, in July 2021, German newspaper Die Zeit published an article in which 38 people, including celebrities such as former Bundesliga coach Ottmar Hitzfeld or star chef Tim Raue, discussed their struggles with mental health. Even internationally recognized athletes like Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka began speaking publicly about their psychological problems. When Biles announced her withdrawal from the Olympic Games on social media, support poured in in the form of hundreds of thousands of likes within just a few hours.', 'Will this openness also encourage people in other areas of society to talk about their mental health disorders? Investors seem to believe so: in 2021, mental health was the most-funded category for digital health investments according to investment company Rock Health.', 'Even though society is slowly acknowledging that mental health challenges are real, we are still having a hard time believing that mental problems also occur at the workplace ‚Äì in every company, in every team and at every level of the organization. And yes, they really do.', 'Many organizations still fail to address the issue of mental disorders, offering only band-aid solutions like yoga programs, free meditation and healthy snacks instead of actual treatment. Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì wellness benefits are also important, but not enough on their own. Due to the pressure from Gen Y and Z employees, more progressive companies are now realizing that a foosball table is not enough to retain employees ‚Äì they also need mental health benefits.', 'At Futurice, we started asking ourselves how we can take the burden off the shoulders of individuals and be a positive driver of mental health as an employer. We actively chose to make mental health a priority, and took concrete action. In the following, I will summarize our approach and what we‚Äôve done about the issue so far.', 'Starting the dialogue: Already during their onboarding period, every new joiner will touch upon the topic of mental health ‚Äì at the latest when our office managers draw attention to specific support opportunities and mental health benefits at Futurice. We openly recognize that mental health problems occur at our workplace.', 'Training and education as a further starting point: In April of 2022, we organized a company-wide theme week focusing on mental health. We hired mental health consultancy Shitshow to host two sessions for our employees and discuss what mental health is, what kinds of mental health myths exist, and what work has to do with mental health.', 'Sharing personal stories and being vulnerable can make a big difference. To actually engage in conversations about your own mental health, you need psychological safety. Every employee at Futurice has a supervisor and a FutuBuddy with whom they have regular personal check-ins. We are aware of the fact that 62% of employees would feel more comfortable talking about their mental health if their managers also spoke openly about it. We encourage each individual ‚Äì especially those in leadership roles ‚Äì to be more vulnerable and act as role models on mental health issues, and support them in creating safe spaces where it is easier to share personal matters.', 'We regularly review the impact of our organizational values, beliefs and policies in order to get an idea of whether they generate a lot of stress or promote healthy collaboration.', ""Human Care ‚Äì that's the name of our people team, and our answer to what many other organizations call HR ‚Äì does its best to improve the working environment also from the point of view of mental health. At the time of writing, one of our internal task forces is working on an early care conversation guide, designed to make it easier and safer to start conversations about mental health at work. Because let's be honest ‚Äì we‚Äôre not professionals at this either, and for many of us the topic is still taboo."", 'As a company dealing with all aspects of data, we naturally also use surveys to track the current well-being trends of our employees ‚Äì anonymously and with utmost respect towards their privacy, of course. The surveys we conduct are evaluated on a weekly basis and the responses we get are used for further development of our company culture. They provide a great opportunity for us to reflect on our progress as a company promoting mental health. Change doesn‚Äôt happen overnight ‚Äì it is a process that requires repeated adjustments over a long period of time.', 'As a workplace, we also do our best to offer our employees security in the form of financial and job stability, as well as ensuring a collaborative and inclusive work environment.', 'The need to care for one‚Äôs own mental health and wellbeing can vary a lot depending on the person. Therefore, we offer our employees access to Auntie, a low-threshold wellbeing service based on conceptualized packages around certain work or life situation related themes ‚Äì such as sleeplessness or stress, and even more specific scenarios, such as the ‚ÄúLeader in Rough Waters‚Äù package. The services are facilitated by an Auntie professional via video connection. Employees can simply book the service if they feel the need to do so, and this will remain anonymous so that Futurice does not find out which employee has used the service.', 'Our occupational health insurance also covers a wide variety of treatments and therapies. In Germany, for example, we provide occupational health insurance that covers the costs for various therapeutic aids such as medical baths, massages or occupational therapy.', 'And last but not least, we are currently using our creative muscle to figure out our approach to the future of work ‚Äì such an evergreen topic in a constantly changing world! There is an increasing demand for flexibility, which also means that work is being individualized to a great degree. One of the many questions we are facing is how to create a secure and connected workplace both online and offline that can be a positive driver for mental health ‚Äì while at the same time taking into account different individual needs?

My hobbies also include coding challenges, cryptography, cloud computing, movies (Star Wars rules!), and gaming.', 'Irtaza: I‚Äôve studied Computer Science and Engineering at Technische Universiteit Delft in the Netherlands. Currently, I am a Data Consultant at Futurice. My hobbies include playing football, going to the gym, and running. I am originally from Pakistan and have lived most of my life in Finland.', 'May: I saw Futurice Academy as a bridge to turn my coding passion into a professional career. I applied because I liked the recruitment process at Futurice ‚Äì I actually applied a couple of times to a more experienced level before I got accepted.', 'Arsalan: I first found out about Futurice when my brother Numan Shakil, who also works here, took me to the annual FutuParty in 2019 and introduced me to his colleagues. That experience got me really interested in Futurice as a workplace because of its culture, values, polite and extremely talented people.', 'Irtaza: I was looking to switch to consulting and get a taste of it. However, because I was new to consulting, I also wanted to learn its methods, for which the Academy was the perfect opportunity. In addition to technical lectures on different topics, the Academy guided us to deepen our knowledge on the cloud.', 'May: After my previous applications, I had gotten feedback on why I was not qualified at the time, which helped a lot. The application process was the best. I was informed of what was going on and what to expect. I included my website portfolio, GitHub profile with my personal projects, updated LinkedIn profile, CV, and a cover letter.', 'Arsalan: The application process was very smooth and seamless. When applying to Futurice Academy, I simply submitted my CV, cover letter, my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.', 'Irtaza: The application process went smoothly for me. I included my resume, a cover letter and a couple of recommendation letters. Also, I included a GitHub link to one of my projects. Next, I had an interview with two technical people from Futurice. During the interview, we got to know each other a bit more and I presented my project, an artificial neural network (ANN) built from scratch that classified grocery items.', 'May: First, planning for that day, then reading and writing code, reading documentation, learning new things, asking someone questions if I got stuck, and meeting with the team.', 'Arsalan: My normal day started with a cup of coffee and a 15-minute meeting with my team. I then checked my emails, Slack and LinkedIn just so I hadn‚Äôt missed anything. After that, I started working on my tasks for the day, usually including creating digital platforms for our clients.', 'Irtaza: I‚Äôd have a cup of coffee and start working. I usually worked till 11:30 before I grabbed some lunch with a colleague. As I like different types of cuisine, I kept exploring different restaurants in the city center. I continued working till 17:00.', 'May: The project ‚Äì which is the same project I also work at the moment ‚Äì was a professional kitchen AI app.', 'Arsalan: I was working on a project with cutting edge technology where we developed an indoor location tracking solution for our client and helped them explore emerging technology to scale their business.', 'Irtaza: I worked on a project where we used data to produce value and integrated predictive analytics and artificial intelligence into digital platforms.', 'May: My teammates are so smart and intelligent.

The cloud and Scrum certifications helped me familiarize myself with the technical terms and frameworks before diving into the project.', 'Arsalan: My highlight was when I got the chance to meet all the Academy students and have pizza with them. I was very delighted to meet such a talented and diverse group of like-minded people.', 'Irtaza: The best thing about Futurice Academy was its format. It is perfectly balanced between both learning and gaining experience. As part of learning, we had various technical lectures and did cloud certifications. To gain experience, we worked on real-world projects, learned how they work and contributed to them.', 'May: Yes ‚Äì my expectations were met, and no improvements come to mind.', ""Arsalan: When I started the academy, I was a bit skeptical, but the whole experience took me by surprise, and everything was above my expectations. One thing that I missed was interaction with more people at the start due to Covid, but that was something that couldn't be compromised due to safety precautions."", 'Irtaza: Futurice Academy exceeded my expectations. Every part of the way was smooth, and if we had any problems, we always found help and support help from other colleagues.', 'May: Futurice Academy was a life-changing opportunity for me.

Investing in the accessibility of digital services is more important than ever.,"['What is the responsibility of the developers of digital services?', 'How to make accessibility a stronger part of the development of digital services', 'List of useful sources']","['The importance of digital accessibility has grown in recent years as more and more operators have started offering their services digitally. The pace of development is fast ‚Äì but it must never be so fast that some people are left behind. Investing in the accessibility of digital services is more important than ever.', 'Accessibility is, in my opinion, one of the most important and impactful things you can contribute to as an IT professional. Contrary to the common misconception, accessibility is not some nonsense that only helps a small number of people ‚Äì it helps all of us. After all, each of us will inevitably experience various disabilities in our lives from time to time, whether permanent or temporary.', 'For example, glare from sunlight can get so strong that without proper contrast, it can be next to impossible to read the content of a website. Over time, your eyesight can also deteriorate, so a small font and poor contrast can cause problems. By developing services and products with accessibility in mind, we maximise the chances that everyone will be able to use them.', ""Accessibility is also a great advantage for business: Why exclude some users when you can offer your service to everyone? It is estimated that 15% of people have one or more disabilities, and among the elderly population, the share is close to 50%. This is a huge portion of the world's population, and a number of people you simply cannot exclude. And in case being the right thing to do isn‚Äôt enough to convince someone, it‚Äôs worth noting that accessible websites are also favored by search engine algorithms, leading to higher rankings in search results, as well as increased brand visibility, conversion rates and site traffic."", 'The use of digital services exploded when Covid-19 hit the world. For a large number of people, the pandemic finally made it possible to work, study, buy groceries and get medical care remotely, for example. At the same time, numerous cautionary examples demonstrated why accessibility is so important. Many accessibility problems emerged in communication platforms, information systems and digital healthcare services used by millions of people daily, to name just a few examples.', 'It is clear that we still have a long way to go to enable everyone to use digital services and be part of society in an equitable manner. Remote life and digital services are here to stay, so we need to keep investing in accessibility.', 'As part of my job, I solve various accessibility challenges and have had the opportunity to work with visually impaired people. A couple of years ago, I interviewed a visually impaired person who described perfectly whether or not digital services were making the world a more equal place.', 'This person had started their own business in the 1980s and in the early years, there was no technology to support them in invoicing or making receipts ‚Äì they had to rely on customers to do it instead. It was only later on, as technology developed, that they were able to do invoicing and other tasks themselves. The part they stressed as the most important was being able to do more things themselves.', 'When I asked them about the development of digital services, the answer was clear: technology and digital services have evolved enormously and most services are so complex that they are difficult to use for visually impaired people. As a result we are, to a certain extent, taking a step backwards. In order for us to start moving forward again, we need to take care of accessibility in digital services.', 'The biggest takeaway I learned from this experience is that it is very important for people without disabilities to understand and learn about living with different disabilities. Every single person working in IT and developing digital services can directly strengthen or weaken equity through their actions. We can decide whether or not we enable people to use digital services regardless of their background and possible disabilities.', ""What is important to note about accessibility is that it brings a new point of view into things you are already doing. If you're a developer, you need to pay attention to things that you may not have known about before ‚Äì some of them may already be familiar to you, but you may just not have known that they could be improved with accessibility. If you're a designer, you might consider accessibility for example by choosing different colors and fonts than the ones you would have used otherwise."", ""If you're not familiar with developing an accessible digital service, don't worry ‚Äì we‚Äôre all beginners at one point! I haven't always been familiar with it either, but I've learned a lot over the years. The amount of information available on the topic is so vast that it can feel difficult to get started. There's no need to be anxious about learning about accessibility. Every single project can be a start for your learning journey, and there are plenty of examples and tutorials to help you along the way ‚Äì check out the list at the end of this blog post for some tips."", 'I strongly recommend that you first learn about what accessibility means in general and then choose a few things that you could pay more attention to in your own work. For example, fixing the most commonly detected accessibility issues is one way to start developing accessibility. You will learn more along the way!', 'In conclusion, the most important aspect of accessibility is its social impact. I believe every IT professional should take responsibility for the world they create through their work. Services that are not accessible prevent people from using them and, by extension, from participating in society. Failure to take accessibility into account is discrimination which can in some cases even be in breach of the law.', 'Developing the accessibility of digital services is developing equity.

Future-proof your business in Lean Startup mode', '2. Understand market dynamics before envisioning the future', '3. Utilize partnerships and ecosystems', '4. Analyze the future methodically using strategic foresight', '5. Gain more insight into the future of mobility']","['The mobility industry is going through a paradigm shift where sustainability is climbing higher on the list of shareholder expectations. As a result, car manufacturers feel increasing pressure to, for example, apply sustainable practices throughout their business ‚Äì not just in the electrification of their offering, but in all areas from the drawing board to production and aftermarket services. This change has brought new uncertainty into the horizon, and organizations can no longer expect everything to simply continue as before.', 'In order to help mobility companies stay in the driver‚Äôs seat for the future of the mobility industry and shape their own futures, in this blog post we will share five power moves based on our experience in the industry over several years.', 'Let‚Äôs start things off with an example from a global B2B car leasing and renting business. A well-known and respected company had previously succeeded in a price-competitive market by delivering highly individualized and customized solutions. But in 2019, the market shifted as electric vehicles started to go mainstream, while there was still plenty of uncertainty in the air about the total cost of ownership of EVs as well as their value retention.', 'Read more on the electrification mobility', 'To future-proof its business, the company took a new strategic approach in a lean way. It decided to put more emphasis on listening to its corporate stakeholders, and began seeing gains and pains that many of them were not even aware of yet. The company also monitored the regulatory and taxonomic discussions in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) sphere as well as on the EU level. As a result, they understood that CO2 emissions were about to become a highly relevant factor in purchasing corporate fleet cars or light commercial vehicles ‚Äì equal in importance to the total cost of ownership.', 'Next, the company went into Lean Startup mode in order to help its customers reach zero emissions within their corporate mobility fleets regardless of the stage they were on in that process. They first introduced a free-of-charge e-mobility guide for companies, and then started facilitating mobility workshops to help establish a guideline for corporate regulations.', 'Read more on zero emission mobility\nRead more on e-mobility', 'Before long, the company‚Äôs leasing and rental business had grown a third pillar of revenue out of its newly-developed consulting services ‚Äì a completely new business area for them. This serves as a reminder of how crucial it is to listen to your customers and their problems carefully, and do your homework in order to anticipate their future gains and pains, and prepare your organization to meet their demands.', 'Next, we‚Äôll take a look at an umbrella brand for a car manufacturer‚Äôs mobility service offering. The company focuses solely on a car subscription service where it strives to be the best ‚Äì no more, no less. Users can order a car from their website in three minutes, and the new car will then be delivered in three days, which is an outstanding feat as this process can traditionally take around 2‚Äì12 months. It‚Äôs full-service, too with the cost including everything apart from fuel.', 'Read more - mobility ecosystems and cars', 'So how did they achieve this? By understanding the basic dynamics of the present as well as the future of the mobility industry ‚Äì moving either people or goods ‚Äì and how to improve on that.', 'Most companies focus on moving people, and to move them, you need physical assets such as airplanes, buses, trains, cars, and bikes ‚Äì all of which can get quite expensive ‚Äì and this is how things will remain until someone perfects the art of teleportation. In the mobility industry, the physical side is the tricky part of the equation.', 'For example, to run a car subscription service for a thousand customers, you‚Äôll also need at least a thousand cars. And in order to own a fleet of a thousand cars, you‚Äôll need to invest something to the tune of 30 million euros. You‚Äôll also need to do (at the very least) a thousand maintenance operations every year ‚Äì and that‚Äôs without counting incidental repair needs that are bound to happen now and then. That‚Äôs around three or four maintenance reservations a day if they‚Äôre spread evenly across the whole year.', 'In certain markets where proper winter conditions are a thing (such as in Finland) you‚Äôll also need to change tires twice a year as winter comes and goes. Cars in these markets will also have two sets of tires per vehicle, and you‚Äôll of course need to find enough storage capacity for the 4,000 unused tires somewhere. And if your customer happens to be based somewhere in the northern parts of Finland, you cannot tell them to just casually drive 800‚Äì1000 kilometers all the way down south to the Helsinki region for a simple tire change. So you‚Äôll need to somehow deliver the extra tire sets to your customers. And so on, and so forth.', 'In order to succeed in future, you must understand these basics and ensure that your business is built on a solid and well-functioning supply chain. It‚Äôs no wonder, then, that the next big disruption in mobility is believed to happen on the supply side and in asset management, and it‚Äôs likely to take a long time. If you want to know where your mobility business is going, you‚Äôll need to think about what will happen over the next 20 years. Once you figure that out, then you can start thinking about what might be realistic in the future within the next 12 months.', 'Instead of constraining people into one car to drive from point A to point B every day, a promising startup wanted to offer people access to every mode of transportation ‚Äì both those that exist today, and others that may eventually become available in the future.', 'The company wanted to offer the journeys as a service built into one easy-to-use application and utilizing a simple subscription format akin to Netflix or Spotify. Everything was going smoothly until the city where the service was about to be launched decided it wanted to control the traffic itself. Lesson learned: it‚Äôs important to understand the underlying regulatory implications and draft your contracts accordingly. Collaboration and partnerships within the mobility industry have the power to either make or break companies depending on whether they work.', 'Another similar example are e-scooters. As an increase in road accidents and problems with poor user behavior swept over city after city after the rollout of e-scooter services, the entire business was suddenly facing various restrictions and even banned in some locations. Hindered by the public outcry, many e-scooter businesses slowed down considerably, and became impossible to even sell, leading to many startups going bankrupt. In a complex business landscape like mobility you need many views in order to plan the future ‚Äì you have to consider everything from infrastructure to consumer behavior and attitudes, and from business models to regulation.', 'In most companies, business risks are (or at least should be) taken seriously. They are assessed and analyzed carefully, and then taken into account in business planning. But when you think about it ‚Äì shouldn‚Äôt the exact same organizational response apply to business opportunities or even to industry opportunities as well?', 'In order to understand your potential business opportunities and the environment you will be operating in, you need strategic foresight, a category under the broader practice of futures thinking. It‚Äôs essentially an action-oriented approach that looks at the signals and trends that are happening, attempts to understand their long-term implications, and then circle back to present day to establish a clear picture of the kinds of actions we can take to prepare.', 'During the strategic foresight process, you first gather all the aspects, trends and signals that are relevant and influential to your domain. In order to find the correct focus, you need to apply certain practices, such as PESTLE analysis. You then categorize these findings into phenomena. The ongoing trends also have a natural tendency to coalesce into certain specific phenomena.', 'In the next phase, these phenomena are described in a chart we call the future table. This is crucial groundwork for the next steps. As any phenomena that we see around us today could manifest in many different forms in the future, you also have to outline many different alternative future possibilities. This, in turn, lays the groundwork for the scenarios ‚Äì the stories of the future worlds built around the signals and trends that are taking place today.', 'Finally, the scenarios are represented as prototypes called provocative prototypes ‚Äì they can be products, brands, companies, or political opinions that don‚Äôt exist yet. They are an embodiment of the risks, the roles, and the opportunities that companies may see for themselves in the future. This enables us to utilize the scenarios in strategy work and turn them into actions for your business units. As your employees participate throughout the journey, they start looking in the same direction, which helps the implementation of the strategy.', ""Taking the complexity of the mobility industry into account, a strategic foresight process requires partners that can actually address these opportunities and risks of certain size and magnitude. For example, operators such as insurance and energy companies can offer valuable insight ‚Äì but at the same time, they could also learn a lot from mobility experts. If the strategic foresight work is done in isolation, people tend to reflect the future on their own cultural framework. This can prevent asking the most important, uncomfortable questions that might be crucial in the future. That's why strategic foresight needs an ecosystem approach, something we‚Äôve previously addressed in the context of retail."", 'All the examples you‚Äôve read about in this blog post come from actual companies in the real world, and there‚Äôs much more to be learned from them than what we were able to fit into this article. But luckily, we‚Äôve made it easy to learn more and dive deeper into the subject by watch our recent future of mobility webinar, complete with amazing guest speakers sharing their thoughts and ideas!', 'The webinar includes valuable case studies from BMW Group company Alphabet Germany‚Äôs former Chief Commercial Officer Susan K√§ppeler, and Toyota Finance Finland‚Äôs General Manager of Mobility and Marketing Matti Tanninen.

This blog post focuses on the basics of MLOps as well as its benefits in real-world use.,"['What is MLOps?', 'Why should you consider MLOps and what are its benefits?', 'What are the components of MLOps architecture?', 'Summary: MLOps in a nutshell', 'Development', 'Deployment to production', 'Maintenance']","['Using machine learning for various tasks can mean a variety of different things depending on the use case, and the same goes for what they require in terms of management and maintenance. MLOps offers a set of guidelines and best practices that help approach the entire lifecycle of machine learning in a systematic way. In this blog post, I‚Äôll go through the basics of MLOps, starting from the concept itself as well as the concrete benefits it can offer in real-world use.', 'MLOps or Machine Learning Operations is an emerging concept in the field of data that helps project teams to utilize the full potential of their talent on developing machine learning models rather than manually wrangling data or running deployments to move the application code from local development to test environment or production use. MLOps offers a systematic approach to monitoring, scaling, and evaluating data pipelines and machine learning models that benefit all kinds of projects, whether complex applications, proof-of-concept work, or anything in-between.', 'With the application of MLOps principles, the data scientists can focus on the core development of machine learning models, which often is the most interesting part, while the MLOps practices take care of manual tasks such as data cleaning, quality control, and model versioning.', 'But applying MLOps not only brings ease and benefits to data scientists and engineers working with application development. It also equally benefits the business owners and clients. Automation allows for faster development leading to faster results and more reliable machine learning models ensuring functionality from the beginning. This leads to shorter development times that in turn bring faster end-result delivery and cost-effectiveness. Finally automated quality control ensures more reliable solutions that are ensured and tested to function as intended reducing the risk of faulty deployments.', 'At its core, MLOps refers to the lifecycle management of machine learning projects. It is a key concept of modern machine learning application development, and its purpose is to make training, deploying and maintaining of machine learning applications seamless and efficient. MLOps is not a set of specific technologies or approaches but rather an umbrella term for activities focused on building reliable and well functioning machine learning models. It includes both development work practices and ways of working as a project team. To put it simply, you could call MLOps a set of best practices for machine learning application development.', 'In software development, DevOps has been applied for years to automate integrations, testing, and deployments of code, easing the work of software developers and creating less error-prone development practices. MLOps aims to bring the same best practices to machine learning development to ease the work of ML engineers, allowing them to focus on the core aspect of algorithm development, and create more reliable applications.', 'Machine learning solutions solve increasingly complex problems within a variety of industries every day. The applications we build must be reliable, scalable, and efficient to develop, maintain, and use. Traditionally, processing data, creating, updating, and validating models, creating deployments, and maintaining applications have all required a huge amount of hands-on work from experts, which can be repetitive and error-prone. MLOps brings a set of tools for automating many of these steps and allows for example manual data processing and model validation to become parts of an automated pipeline.', 'The biggest benefit of MLOps is that it helps in automating certain steps of ML processes, allowing experts to focus on core functionalities instead. In short, whether MLOps makes sense for you boils down to one question ‚Äì why spend time creating pipelines, automated validations and deployments instead of hopping to algorithm development instantly?', 'The benefits of utilizing MLOps manifest in the later stages of a project. Development, deployment and maintenance processes become increasingly efficient, allowing experts to focus on the core problems and enabling faster delivery. Utilizing MLOps enables us to build end-to-end solutions faster, providing improved focus on creating genuine business value. Generally speaking, the major benefits of applying MLOps to project work come from increased efficiency and reliability.', 'Next, we‚Äôll take a closer look at the core benefits of the approach at each key phase of the machine learning application development process.', 'The process of developing a machine learning model follows an iterative process: The model is trained, validated, and tested in an iterative manner to obtain the best possible model for the use case.', 'When starting a data-focused project development process, the first step is commonly to preprocess and validate the data. This step benefits hugely from automation as the process can be both time-consuming and prone to errors. Sufficient and consistent preprocessing ensures well functioning models after training. Similarly, the data validation process can be automated to ensure the data meets the same criteria every time.', 'During model development, training is a key step. During the training process the model is introduced to a dataset representing the use case and the model learns parameters best describing that dataset. After training the model is able to apply the defined parameters to new data and create for example predictions or classifications, depending on the selected use case. With utilization of MLOps practices the model training ‚Äì which can take from minutes to days depending on the amount of data ‚Äì can be initiated automatically after each change in the model, reducing the required amount of manual work.', 'With the help of automation, keeping track of the different model versions becomes increasingly straightforward, and testing and validation can be introduced to the pipeline, which in turn helps ensure sufficient model quality control. Automated model version control also allows the use of a feature store, where certain highly successful features and characteristics of a model can be stored, tracked and used later on as needed.', 'The deployment process can be automated as well. The pipeline to production can contain checks and tests that the program must pass to ensure model accuracy is as good as (or better than) the current one, the program does not contain any major errors, and all features work as intended. Automated testing ensures that all the code is properly tested and meets the required quality standards.', 'Automated deployment process also gives us the opportunity to easily execute something called a canary deployment. This means the model is initially only exposed to a limited number of users to ensure correct functionality, and then later on ‚Äì if things work as expected ‚Äì to all users, which ensures the solution stays functional with the highest quality at all times.', 'Machine learning models are initially trained during the development phase. But what is obtained at that point should not be considered the final model ‚Äì a better approach would be to think of it as the first deployment model in a continuous improvement process, where a new model can be retrained in regular intervals as more data is obtained. This ensures that the model is always at its best. Automating the process allows for effortless re-training, as the model is automatically re-trained for example at a set interval or when new data is presented.', 'Now, let‚Äôs quickly introduce the building blocks of a general level architecture for applying MLOps in a project. The steps of the process are the same as in traditional projects, but here they are augmented with automation. The image below presents a general architecture for implementing MLOps in project work.', ' MLOps architecture diagram', 'The pipeline begins with data being fetched from storage. Afterwards, the data preparation process starts, which includes for example data cleaning, validation and formatting. After the preprocessing step, the data is in a format that can be utilized in model training. An automated pipeline will trigger the model training process once the data is present and the model code is validated through a continuous integration & development (CI/CD) pipeline. The resulting model is moved to the validation & evaluation step, where automated tests and checks are run to ensure the model is adequate for deployment and the performance matches at least a minimum threshold, but preferably is at least equal or better than the current model.', 'During the evaluation step the model is assessed for highly successful and well performing features. Those features are moved to feature storage, from where they can be utilized when training the next generation model.', 'If the validation and evaluation of the model has been successful, the model automatically moves to deployment, where the model is taken into production use. Finally, the created model is then moved to version control to keep track of the different model versions and provide the possibility to revert to an earlier version if necessary.', 'Finally, during the application use, automated monitoring will ensure everything works as intended and allow for swift maintenance in case any issues occur.', 'Though all the steps of the process are automated and run by default, the user can always for example stop the process at any step or run any additional steps if deemed necessary. The loop structure of the pipeline allows for easy maintenance, model updates and mode re-training, as the pipeline can be triggered for example in case new data is applied to the storage or model code is updated.', 'MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, is an umbrella term for activities around lifecycle management of machine learning applications. It covers everything from automated data processing and model training pipelines to automated code and model deployments and quality assurance.', 'The ML approach does not include a single set of tools or technologies, but is rather a collection of best practices utilizing automated tools, processes, and ways of working. The aim is to create machine learning applications that are safer, more efficient, more reliable, and easy to reproduce and maintain, but require less manual work from experts. The methodology allows machine learning engineers and data scientists to focus on the core development of the model rather than spending time on tasks unrelated to data science, such as preprocessing data, configuring environments, or monitoring models. The faster deliveries and better performing models provide faster value to the end-user and customer bringing benefits also to the business owners.', 'MLOps can be applied to projects of a variety of sizes and will provide benefits from small proofs-of-concept to large application development, but the method especially shines in big, long-term projects where the amount of manual work can often grow.']",[]

After the varied and interesting career path that brought her here, she‚Äôs ready to get into the groove and deepen her knowledge of UX and UI design.', 'It might look random if you look at my CV, but it actually makes perfect sense! I‚Äôve always had three driving forces. Firstly, I‚Äôm a visual thinker, secondly I like to help people and, thirdly I have an interest in tech and innovation, which has been growing recently.', 'Throughout my career journey, I‚Äôve been seeking a position where I can combine these three interests on a daily basis. As a lawyer I could help people and enact justice, but this didn‚Äôt cater for my other career goals. Another path I tried was communications and marketing, which would let me realise my creative potential, but I found I was helping businesses, not people, and also the tech and innovation side was missing. When I learned about UX and UI design, I realised I could do all the things I like the most in one job!', 'It was a surprising choice, as I wasn‚Äôt looking for a consultancy firm ‚Äì I had the idea that there‚Äôs no healthy culture in that world so I was aiming for a product company with a mature design culture. Futurice was one of the few consultancy firms I spoke to, but I realised that it‚Äôs different from the others ‚Äì it‚Äôs very true to its values. During the interview, I was really impressed with the attention they paid to my CV and portfolio, down to small personal details. Futurice pays so much attention to human beings and that showed me that this isn‚Äôt a typical consultancy, and made me want to work here.', 'I didn‚Äôt have a traditional learning path, so I paved my own way on this journey. I‚Äôve always been into visual design and using design tools, but to transfer these skills into a professional setting I needed a mindset change to be more clear and organised. I also had to learn specific things like design thinking, methodology and frameworks for co-creation and cooperation, which I did through an accelerator programme called Digital Product School organised by UnternehmerTUM, an entrepreneurial hub in Germany. After this I filled the remaining gaps with online courses, networking and meetups with people in the field ‚Äì personal mentorship has really helped me.', '', 'It‚Äôs a combination of things, but ‚Äúculture‚Äù is the best word to describe this combination. I really like the culture of trust and seeing the good in people, which is aligned with my personal values ‚Äì and I very much appreciate that everyone here actually behaves according to the company‚Äôs values, which is rare.', 'There are two things I appreciate about this field. The first is that it has a lot of depth, and directions in which I can keep learning ‚Äì there‚Äôs the visual side, with holistic static designs or animation and motion design, and then there‚Äôs the tech aspect, including process design and facilitation, experimental design and using statistical analysis and data science to make designs science-proof and interesting. It can be overwhelming with so many directions to pursue, but it‚Äôs ideal for me as I like to learn.', 'The other part is the opportunity to work in and learn about different domains. This isn‚Äôt popular with many designers, who think you should pick a speciality and stick with it, but I like working in different sectors.', 'I‚Äôm inspired by people who are motivated to learn, develop and make a positive change in the world. I also enjoy working in a diverse environment ‚Äì true invention happens when you‚Äôre surrounded by people with different opinions and backgrounds and it‚Äôs a driving force behind innovation thinking. Teams at Futurice are always diverse, and this is something the company pays attention to.', 'It might sound nerdy, but I keep learning! I‚Äôve been learning German and UX-related topics, and I‚Äôm currently into designing for AI, so I learn by attending meetups or reading. When I want to rest, I go out in the beautiful Bavarian nature to recharge, which I combine with photography, another hobby I enjoy. I also like taking care of myself and the people I love through food and cooking.', 'My current focus is to find myself as a designer ‚Äì I love my current role, so I want to dive deeper and discover what part of it I enjoy most. Right now, I‚Äôm trying to learn more about designing for AI by getting hands-on experience. I really appreciate that I can do that here at Futurice.', ""*Interested in reading more stories about us and our people? At Futurice, we celebrate diversity and cherish everyone's unique journey.

You will get the understanding why Site Reliability Engineering is cheaper than traditional ops in the long run, how it maximizes the value of a service and what are the other benefits of the SRE. Throughout this post, we‚Äôll explain how the practices and terminologies of DevOps and SRE are interrelated.', 'In a nutshell, Site Reliability Engineering, SRE, is...', 'As you see, the meaning of SRE can be summarized from multiple perspectives. Let‚Äôs open these a bit.', 'Software engineers, or developers as they are usually called, spend time engineering solutions. You pay them to design and build solutions. Operators, however, traditionally use their time to manually operate and maintain the solution developers have built.', 'These two worlds - engineering solutions and maintaining solutions - have been quite different and that has caused lots of problems.', 'DevOps puts the developers and operators into the same team, thus breaking down silos between them.', ""Site Reliability Engineering takes that thought a bit further: why don't we use a software engineering approach also for the operations? Instead of doing things manually, let's engineer solutions that reduce the need for manual work."", 'SREs reduce the need for manual work in future. Some examples of how this can be done: improving processes, increasing self-service, building automation and tooling and improving service reliability.', 'The traditional way of doing operations is to use human labor. Some desired service level is agreed (SLA) and then by default, a minimum amount of work is done that is required to fulfill that agreed level.', 'When service grows, the amount of work needed for operations also grows. The growth of operation costs grows linearly together with the service size and complexity.', 'SRE is actually cheaper than traditional ops, because you need less than a linear amount of work. That is true thanks to the SREs using their time to engineer solutions, which reduces the need for manual work in the future.', 'The better service quality causes fewer incidents to handle, automation reduces manual work, and antifragility fixes problems before they affect business.', 'So SRE should be thought of as an investment, which has a better ROI than the traditional decrease-the-costs ops approach.', 'Read more - SRE vs. Devops vs. Traditional Ops', 'Ask any IT director what are their top 5 priorities and decreasing IT costs will surely be on their list.', 'That is understandable because 40-90% of service costs incur after launch and a major part of the whole IT budget can go to running costs.', 'Yes, decreasing IT-related costs should be a high priority!', 'Unfortunately, way too often the cost-minimization route causes local optimization and ends up actually paying more.', 'Example: There is a heavyweight internal system, like SAP, centralized API management, or data storage, that directly or indirectly almost every development team has to use.', 'With the cost-optimization approach, the maintenance of the said service is often externalized to a vendor, which promises cheap labor costs. Some service level is set to ensure uptime. What is then monitored are the running costs of the system and whether SLA has been breached.', 'What is not monitored is how much money is wasted due to the system maintenance team not being able to serve dependent project teams properly. You have all seen the problems: long waiting time for change requests, getting proper access never seems to work on the first try and overall black box mentality.', ""Saving some money due to lower labor costs does not cover the money lost due to the operating model which doesn't make good service possible."", 'SRE fixes that by changing the operating model. Systems are operated as services and services do everything they can to serve the internal and external users. They spend money to build better service, whether it means improving the system, process, or self-service. The money spent will cause huge cost savings in the future, as the dependent development teams waste fewer resources.', 'After the initial investment, which might be a bit higher than with traditional ops, in the long run, this operating model will save more money.', 'As previously stated, SRE takes a service approach for operations. Services, as the name implies, are built to serve their users.', 'There is a sweet spot between resources used to run and improve service and the value it brings. After some optimum point, the return of investment is no longer justified.', ""SRE has mechanisms both to measure the service value and for finding the sweet spot. Let's first discuss the former."", 'A key concept of SRE is a ""Service Level Objectives"", SLOs, which basically state desired level of how well the service should serve its users.', 'Desired level, not maximum level, because of the diminishing returns after the sweet spot. The business makes the decision about the desired level, as they also pay for the service development costs.', 'Example: ""We have an online store. Obviously, we want our customers to be able to find and buy products. So instead of just measuring whether the online store is up, we should measure whether the end-users can find the products they are seeking and for example, whether the purchase process can be completed successfully.""', 'SLOs force you to think about what are the main user journeys of your service and then set what is the acceptable level of failures in a month.', 'SRE takes a realistic approach to the operations - it cannot be done without failures. What can be done, however, is to decrease the failure size and impact and find a sweet spot between development speed and amount of failures.', 'Failures can be seen as a product of development speed. The faster you run, the more failures there will be. The optimal amount of failures is never zero, as that would mean a total halt of development.', 'The balance between speed and failure differs from service to service. The decision is left for the business to make, as they are the ones who will benefit from the speed and get hurt by the failures.', 'SLO is the mechanism to ensure that the set level is reached.', 'Using the example above, the company can decide that ""95% of the product searches should return a list of products successfully within 5 seconds"".', 'That is an SLO.', 'Then the service can be managed to that level. Whenever the numeric measurement of the SLO tells you that you are above the threshold you can keep on running.', 'Breaching the SLO has consequences. The most common consequence is that new business features are put on hold until the quality of the service is improved and the SLO has been reached again.', 'SRE has lots of mechanisms that help you to detect and fix the problem even before the SLO is breached.', 'SRE is an opinionated collection of principles and practices. It is built on top of DevOps best practices, with an extra focus on production, business and end-user.', 'DevOps is a broad set of principles, guidelines, and culture. SRE is one implementation of DevOps. Just like Agile and Scrum, the former being a set of principles and the latter being one implementation of that with set practices.', 'Read more - how do agile and devops interrelate?', 'SRE implements DevOps, meaning that all DevOps principles are incorporated into SRE. On top of that, SRE takes an extra focus on reliability, scalability, business outcomes, and end-users.', 'We‚Äôll dive into the SRE principles and practices next.', 'We already covered that on a high level, but let‚Äôs deep dive a bit.', 'Using a software engineering approach for operations and infrastructure means:', 'Three terms used in SRE:', 'And three golden rules:', '""Toil"" is any manual repetitive and tactical work, without lasting value. The SRE team constantly engineers solutions to reduce the amount of toil.', 'Let‚Äôs be clear here: manual work is not always evil. Rebooting a failed production server has high tactical value and you should do that. But having to reboot production servers (or even having servers) is a toil that most likely can be removed via automation, tooling, and process improvements.', ""Removing toil doesn't always require automating the process. Sometimes toil can be removed by improving the process or increasing self-service."", 'SREs eat their own dog food meaning that they do both the manual work and engineer solutions to reduce the manual work. To ensure they have enough time for the latter, there is usually a gap in how much time they can spend on manual work. That is usually 50%.', 'Building automation should dominate what SRE does. Humans should spend their time on things that matter - that is building more automation or reacting to those operational problems that cannot be automated.', 'Why is automation so important? There are lots of us who have been operating a service that has so many fires to fight, that no one has time to improve the quality of the service. This neverending negative spiral burns people out and costs a lot.', 'This situation rarely happens instantly, but is often the product of bad management decisions. Not investing in automation but just developing new features will increase the need for manual work, until the team is no longer able to do anything but fight the fires.', 'No one deliberately builds a warehouse that collapses after just one year, no matter how busy the organization is. Unfortunately, this attitude is common when dealing with digital services and short-term optimization will have huge costs in the future.', 'Failures are inevitable and a product of development speed. What can be done is to greatly reduce the cost and impact of a failure.', 'Frequent deployments to production decrease batch size, which decreases the risk and impact of failure. Freeze periods are often a signal that deployment sizes are way too large and infrequent.', 'SREs build automation, which handles the deployment. Humans are error-prone, so removing the need for manual work for the deployment process reduces the number of failures.', 'There are lots of deployment tactics to reduce the size of failures. For example ""canary deployment"" means deploying the new version only to 1% of the users. If something goes wrong, 99% of the users are not affected.', 'Automatic rollbacks to the last working configuration are also a common tactic.', 'SREs share the same skills with the development teams. That helps to break boundaries between development and operations. That also helps the developers to be responsible for the operations instead of externalizing the problem to the operations people.', 'When the development team follows SRE best practices or staffs the team with SRE experts, the end goal is that more engineers will have experience in production deployments, not less.', ""So although the SRE experts have exquisite operations skills, they don't take the whole responsibility of operations, but instead, share the best practices with the whole team."", 'There are no individual roles within SRE. A Site Reliability Engineer is a person who is really skilled at Site Reliability Engineering, but any team can start incorporating SRE best practices into their daily work.', 'However, there are clearly different roles of SRE teams. Here are the most common:', 'Operates what they build', 'Operates foundations that other teams use', 'Helps others to operate better', 'Operates services built by others', 'These roles might be combined, so for example Platform team can also work as an SRE center of practice, both supporting teams with their ops problems and building common solutions for them.', 'As you notice, only some of the topologies operate services built by others. So SRE doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to necessarily outsource operations from the development team and in most cases that is not the optimal solution unless your scale is huge.', 'Site Reliability Engineering, SRE, is an approach where operations and infrastructure are handled with software engineering practices.', 'The main goals of SRE are to reduce manual work by building automation, improving processes, increasing self-service, and improving service reliability.', 'SRE costs less than traditional operations in the long run due to reducing manual work and maximizing the value of a service. For external services, this helps to optimize and manage the value the service brings to the end-user and thus to the business. For internal services, this has massive benefits as all the dependent development teams will waste less time due to better service.', 'SRE uses DevOps principles and best practices, thus evolving practices of existing teams are easier when the basics are already familiar.']","['Taking software engineering approach for operations and infrastructure', 'Enabling enterprises to reliably and economically scale their critical internal and external services', 'Maximizing service/product value instead of just minimizing the costs, but still with lesser costs in a long run', 'Measuring and optimizing what really matters', 'Balancing service reliability and the pace of developing new features', 'An opinionated collection of principles and practices', 'Treat infrastructure and configuration also as a code, store them to version control, and then use development best practices like peer review process and automated tests to reduce risks and human errors', 'Do what software engineers do: invest time to make more time in the future and build to create lasting value', 'As operations are treated with a software engineering approach, that means most of the tools, techniques, and languages used for operations are familiar to developers. This decreases the silo between these skill sets.', 'Service Level Agreement, SLA, is the minimum level of service promised to customers, and breaching that usually means direct or indirect monetary compensation', 'Service Level Objective, SLO, is an internal goal for the service level. Service is managed to that level and breaching SLO usually has consequences like slowing new feature development until the level is restored. SLOs measure things that matter, like whether the end-user can successfully find and purchase products from an online store, not just what some CPU load measurement is.', 'Service Level Indicator, SLI, is a measurement that indicates the level of service. SLI tells whether you are within your SLO. SLI is often an aggregate of multiple technical measurements from all layers of the service.', 'The business sets the SLO (with the help of others). This way business decides the balance between feature development speed and service level and the business also carries the responsibility of managing the service to hit that level.', 'SLOs measure things that matter. SLOs enforce you to treat service as a whole, understand what is the value it brings to end-users and business and then optimize that to the sweet spot between value and costs', 'SRE is about being proactive. Thanks to measuring and monitoring SLOs, the moment service level starts to deteriorate, a problem can be found and fixed before it even causes any outages.', '""We are SRE"" - any ops or devops team just starts learning SRE practices', '""Embedded SRE"" - SRE expert(s) is injected into the existing development team to evolve their practices toward SRE', '""Platform SRE"" or ""Tooling SRE"" - builds and operates centralized development platforms and common solutions that most of the teams use', '‚ÄúSRE center of practice‚Äù - central SRE team which works both as a pool of experts and also helps development teams to be more efficient', '""Google SRE"" - a model where development and operations are separated. This usually requires a vast organization size to be sensible']"

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that mode of thinking has been oversimplified since day one ‚Äì and by now, it is also severely outdated.', 'Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the need to innovate is not going anywhere. It‚Äôs still necessary to survive in a changing market landscape, and perfectly relevant as the fuel for R&D efforts, but it‚Äôs not enough on its own. In order to gain an edge on your competitors and come out on top, your business should be investing in its capabilities around data and AI. In this blog post, I‚Äôll do my best to explain why that‚Äôs the case, in plain terms and without hype or hyperbole.', 'In most cases, the problem isn‚Äôt primarily about access to relevant business data ‚Äì in fact, many companies are already putting a lot of effort into collecting it. Perhaps paradoxically, the big issue lies within growth, which in turn leads to disconnection.', 'As companies become larger, they are more likely to develop disconnections. Early on, the departments of a company ‚Äì like sales and marketing, R&D, design, production and so on ‚Äì are still able to cross-communicate and keep on top of what each other are doing, and on a general level, different parts of the organization can still maintain a clear overview of what‚Äôs going on.', 'But as the company continues to grow in size, it also grows in complexity, and its connections can begin to fall apart. There are many reasons for this tendency, and it typically revolves around lack of knowledge sharing, common direction and communication between departments. At its core this is a case of one hand not knowing what the other is up to ‚Äì though in the case of large corporations, like the ones we often deal with in Germany, there are always more than just two hands involved. A spider might be a more fitting analogy, maybe even a centipede.', 'And this is where problems begin to develop. The separation between departments can result in duplicated tasks, increased workloads and limited optimisation, all of which slow progress down. This can happen already at a relatively early stage, so the root cause of the issue is not really size ‚Äì it is the disconnect. It is important to address it early on before the symptoms get out of hand.', 'A connected company is one that has successfully tackled the disconnections and achieved cohesion between its various functions. This grants everyone a ‚Äúbigger picture‚Äù overview that allows individuals and teams to keep track of what‚Äôs going on elsewhere in the company, coordinate processes and share valuable information. As a result, the company will likely experience fewer missed opportunities, repeated tasks and wasted effort, which translates into better efficiency and success rate.', 'Particularly larger companies tend to have access to more data, but generally speaking they do not use it optimally. In a disconnected company, the strategy will not be shaped by timely knowledge of market events, internal developments and customer insights. Keeping track of data like this and using it to ensure your entire team is connected will help your organization remain responsive and make data-enabled decisions across the entire value chain and, ultimately, create breakthrough results. We can expect to see this becoming an increasing trend among top companies in the near future.', 'At Futurice, we identified the need to connect our data and knowledge to make better decisions and deliver optimal results a few years ago, and have been working on transforming into a connected company ever since. One of the earliest steps along the way was to identify the internal data sources that make up our company‚Äôs collective digital footprint ‚Äì like calendars, chat tools and timesheets ‚Äì and come up with a way to consolidate it in a way that benefits the entire company‚Äôs situational awareness without compromising anyone‚Äôs privacy.', ""Connecting our 650 individuals and giving them a better view of each other's knowledge has helped us establish a company-wide support network. It helps everyone succeed by pointing them in the right direction for the specific information or expertise they happen to need."", ""What we‚Äôve learned, both through our own transformation and in multiple projects across numerous industries, is that the real value of using AI to process and make sense of data is not primarily about automation.

For example, one of our pharmaceutical clients repeatedly had to adjust their revenue forecasts due to a disconnect between departments which prevented the right decisions from being made, even on the leadership level. At Futurice, we have used popular techniques such as ‚Äúlean value stream mapping‚Äù to deliver great results.', 'There are various approaches you can take if you‚Äôre looking to leverage your existing data and AI to reconnect your organization:', 'Consolidated insights can be used in a variety of ways, for example in key decision-making and course setting ‚Äì such as revenue forecasts.', 'One by one, tackle the key disconnects that you‚Äôve identified ‚Äì just don‚Äôt expect to be able to address them all at once.

https://futurice.com/blog/sustainability-and-the-next-big-thing,Sustainability and the Next Big Thing,2 May 2022,Opinion,"Is the ""bigger is better"" mindset we've lived with for decades sustainable anymore?",[],"['In 1972, the Club of Rome predicted the sustainability problem we are facing now in the Limits to Growth book. Confronted with facts ignored for too long we need to take a hard look at where we stand and consider the possibility that the next big thing might actually be very small.', 'There is a story by Heinrich B√∂ll (1917-1985) in which a businessman on vacation tries to convince a fisherman of the advantages of being industrious. The fisherman had already caught more than enough fish for the day, in fact enough for the next few days, and he‚Äôs lying on the beach, dozing in the sun. The tourist explains to him that with such excellent fishing conditions, it would be wise to go out again and catch even more, sell the excess, grow his business, and become a big player - so that one day he could retire and spend his days relaxing at the beach.\nTo which the fisherman answered: ‚ÄòBut that is exactly what I‚Äôm doing right now.‚Äô', 'The businessman left the scene in a pensive mood.', 'This story, though written in 1963, feels very topical. The Sars-CoV-2 pandemic has been globally the most disruptive event in recent history. Besides being destructive, it had another effect: it slowed us down. For a short time at the beginning of the pandemic, when we still thought it was going to go away, nearly everything deemed nonessential came to a standstill. There was panic - but also the realization that things could, in fact, be different without complete collapse. Suddenly the skies were blue, the air was clean, the roads belonged to cyclists and pedestrians. No more commuting for most of us. People had time to process what had probably been germinating in their subconscious for a while: that the life they were leading before the pandemic was not the life they wanted for themselves. This gave way to the Great Resignation.', 'The Great Resignation was not caused by the pandemic, only catalyzed. One thing that became apparent was that new technology had not delivered on its promise to free us from work. Machines were created to free us from repetitive and tedious work so that humans could have the leisure to do human things. But now it feels like we have even less time than ever before. How can that be?', 'It is a widely held belief that it is a virtue to be industrious and useful, and to delay gratification. A constant 2-3% increase in GDP and a 15-25% growth rate for businesses is considered essential. You rest, you lose. The early bird catches the worm, and the devil has work for idle hands. So if you suddenly have an extra 10 or 20 hours freed up by a machine, you could use it doing things considered to be of no economic value. Or you could work harder, much harder, leave the status quo behind, and be 10 times as productive in the same amount of time. Especially if that is what the competition is doing. 2 3', 'We Humans are brilliant. Just look at what we have achieved: from medical advances that keep us living healthier and longer lives, to everyday comforts that make these lives easier in every respect, be it transportation, communication, house work, or even intellectual labor. But human lives are still very short in the big picture, so it is understandable that most of us are better at tactics than at strategy. We want something and we want it now. The question of the bigger outcome later is too abstract for our brains to process.', 'But this is not just an individual problem. We are facing a number of threats not only to our lifestyle, but to our survival. Some of these were unforeseen, some simply ignored for too long. The awareness around climate change that has emerged in recent years has been upstaged again and again, first by the pandemic, now by the war in Ukraine. And while climate change may well be our biggest threat, it is still too abstract for most people to fully grasp, whereas the pandemic and the war feel much closer and much more personal.', 'However, all these threats are interconnected. Our lifestyle has resulted in an environment that made the pandemic possible, if not unavoidable, and our dependence on fossil fuels has made Germany myopic when looking at our relationship with Russia.', 'At the start of the pandemic lockdowns, scientists made suggestions for using this caesura as a turning point, but, unsurprisingly, we tried to get back to the status quo as quickly as possible. So, unfortunately, while the lockdowns briefly reduced greenhouse gas emissions, in the long run the pandemic hurt the climate more than it helped by creating a narrative that pitted industry and personal wealth against the welfare of the planet. 4', 'We can observe a similar tendency in the war on Ukraine and it presents us with a crucial choice: do we want to accelerate sustainable energy or do we want to go back to using more coal; do we want to be completely independent or just switch our dependence onto partners other than Putin? \nThere would be ways to easily and effectively reduce energy consumption - for example by introducing a speed limit on German roads. The resistance to it is remarkable, considering that Germany is one of the only countries without speed limits (the others being Isle of Man and North Korea). The narrative of the kindergarten teacher and the nurse who need their cars to drive to work in the early morning hours from their homes in the countryside is used to keep fuel prices relatively low, something that benefits the wealthiest 10 percent of the population much more than the handful of nurses (a demographic that only very selectively is cause for concern), who are affected.', 'So we need to ask ourselves what is truly important to us: how can we survive and what does it mean to live well? The fear of losing the right to drive 300 km/h on the Autobahn is symbolic of what stands in the way of reacting to the disaster heading our way (we have already missed the opportunity to avoid it). If we cling to the idea that certain comforts are a birthright, that they must increase by 2% every year, we run into the sustainability problem already facing us. This problem is hardly new. In 1973 the movie Soylent Green, set in the year 2022, offered a pretty plausible look at what life is really going to be like very soon. So it isn‚Äôt as though we don‚Äôt know. Charlton Heston merely told us what the Club of Rome had predicted in 1972, in ‚ÄúLimits to Growth‚Äù.', 'Again, it is miraculous what we as a species have achieved; we are brilliant problem solvers. But we need to determine what the problem actually is that we are trying to solve. Maybe Soylent Green was on to something, maybe we need to reconsider the value of human life in the face of overpopulation. The Yes Men, in one of their pranks, suggested moving from fossil fuels to fuel made from people.', 'But let‚Äôs be serious: No one wants to revert to the days before penicillin, before washing machines, before telecommunication. Still, as we continue to grow and outgrow our resources, we might want to consider the fisherman in B√∂ll‚Äôs story. He had everything he wanted and didn‚Äôt want more than he needed. He represents an alternative to the personality preferred in the famous marshmallow experiment, where all the children receive one marshmallow, and are given the option to eat it now or get a second one if they wait until later. According to the original study, those children able to delay gratification became financially more successful as adults. But did they have much time to spend at the beach?', 'It is in our nature to keep searching for improvements, to make things bigger and better, but we have reached the point where more is less. The next big thing might not be bigger. In fact, it might be smaller. If we want to ensure that life on earth remains safe for a few more generations, the next big thing needs to be more sustainable than it is now, instead of letting the ‚Äòbigger-is-better‚Äô paradigm devour the sustainability margin. And even though tactics are important, we need to work more on our strategy and to keep in mind our common goal. Shifting problems from one place to another in order to evade local legal restrictions will fail in the long run. Eventually everyone will be affected, with poorer countries hit soonest and hardest as climate injustice grows.', 'Which strategy we should pursue depends on what our goals are. In B√∂ll‚Äôs story, both protagonists had very different goals. One sought to maximize production and profit, while the other prioritized having disposable leisure time. As time becomes a most valuable commodity, in an age where we are always reachable and always on, we may find that having one marshmallow right now is good enough. Especially since the original marshmallow experiment was not based on a representative sample of society, and a subsequent restaging found that the ability to delay gratification had a negligible effect on future success, compared to socioeconomic factors (meaning that someone from a wealthy background had a much better chance of succeeding in life than someone from a poor family, no matter how they handled their marshmallows).', 'The bottom line: Progress and growth are wonderful, but we may need to re-define what exactly this will look like.']",[]

Learn how Site reliability engineering can help with IT operations!,"['Why the traditional way of handling ops doesn‚Äôt always cut it', 'DevOps focuses on maximizing the value of services', 'Site Reliability Engineering ‚Äì all the good stuff without any of the nonsense']","['The leap from traditional ops to DevOps brought with it some pretty serious and substantial benefits for software development. Today, Site Reliability Engineering is about to do the same for operations ‚Äì but what exactly are the mechanisms and methods SRE relies on and what are the key differences between SRE, DevOps and traditional operations?', 'My recent blog post discussed the role that DevOps has had in fixing some of the big issues of managing operations, and how Site Reliability Engineering and  SRE services can help take things even further. This time we‚Äôll take a more concrete and detailed look at the inner workings of SRE that help make all this happen.', 'Sometimes the original may indeed be the best option on the market, but the claim doesn‚Äôt necessarily hold true when talking about ops management ‚Äì not categorically, anyway.', 'The traditional way of handling operations has been to allocate people to manually work things out. This is a very expensive approach by default, so different means have been implemented to minimize costs: for example outsourcing operations to an external partner who offers a cheaper hourly rate or a package cost for handling the service. Service level agreements (or SLAs) are then used to strike an acceptable balance between the cost and the quality of the service.', 'A considerable share of IT budgets is spent on running costs for critical and non-critical services. It is understandable that minimizing these costs is something every IT director seeks to do ‚Äì and that model is quite sensible for some use cases, but certainly not all of them. Fortunately, as we‚Äôve established, it‚Äôs not the only model there is.', 'DevOps takes a different approach to the problem. Instead of concentrating on minimizing the cost of operations, they seek to maximize the value of the whole service. Rather than create a logical silo between developing a service and operating it, the entire service is thought of as one entity that requires a set of different skills and roles to build and operate successfully, in order to generate end-user satisfaction and business value. It‚Äôs an elegant approach, and a really nice way of thinking, if you ask me.', 'Some core ways for DevOps to maximize service value include:', 'SRE takes the tried and tested DevOps approach and enhances it by adding some extra focus on production. It retains the emphasis that services do need to be operated ‚Äì but with the important distinction that an expensive workforce should not be wasted on doing the same thing over and over again, since computers are more predictable and way cheaper. SRE uses various means to decrease the manual work needed for operations in order to create more time to build new features and better reliability. ', 'SRE takes an aggressive approach to reducing what could best be described as toil, or repetitive manual work: everything that needs it should be eliminated (as far as the human workforce is concerned) and automated away. Sometimes it means building automation, sometimes it means improving service reliability in order to end up with fewer incidents, and sometimes it means increasing self-service so the need for certain work is no longer needed at all.', 'Reducing manual work will of course require engineering work first ‚Äì so SRE can be thought of as an investment into a better future. SRE has mechanisms to ensure that enough time is allocated to fix things preemptively because not fixing them will cost even more time in the future. It is the solution to the neverending issue of not having time to fix root causes because putting out fires takes all your available time.', 'The second core principle of SRE is to focus on end-user and business value. Like DevOps, SRE measures and uses data for decision-making, but it also takes it a bit further by introducing the concept of Service Level Objectives (SLOs). SLOs are aggregate measurements of how well the end-user can use your service to do something that brings value to you.', 'For example ‚Äì if you have an online storefront, some of the SLOs will ensure that customers can log in, find the products they are looking for, successfully make a purchase and be happy about the whole journey.', 'Yes, you‚Äôll have to measure CPU and latency and whatnot, but these technical stats are not enough on their own. They have to be aggregated into meaningful measurements of the main journeys that end-users can take in your service.', 'The beauty of SRE is that business has to set the desired SLO. It is not something that IT does, but it is a business decision ‚Äì because the stricter the SLO is, the happier your end-users will be, but at the same time, the slower your development speed will be.', 'Once the SLO has been set and measured (the name of the resulting measurement being the Service Level Indicator or SLI), then SRE makes sure that the service is managed to that level. In case the SLO is compromised, SRE has mechanisms to decrease feature development speed and to prioritize improving the quality of the service. And if your SLO is not even remotely at risk, that means that you can run faster and increase the business feature development speed.', 'SRE understands that failures are inevitable, and by default they are considered a product of development speed. The faster you run, the more problems there will be ‚Äì but if you use DevOps principles such as frequent and small deployments to reduce the risk size and blast radius, you can reach the top running speed without risking your SLOs.', 'Like DevOps, SRE is a highly iterative method. You can begin your journey by introducing just some concepts of SRE and setting a relatively loose SLO. Then, little by little, you‚Äôll start to improve both the service quality and automation level, as well as the level of applying SRE principles in your team.', 'Eventually, you‚Äôll reach a point where SRE has a lower total cost of ownership than outsourcing the operations to the cheapest partner. That is because computers work faster than humans and all that service anti-fragility and automation work has reduced the need for human intervention and manual work. It will take a while for sure, but the payoff is more than worth the wait.']","['putting all the necessary people together to avoid communication silos', 'small but frequent deployments to manage risks,', 'using measurements and data to back up decisions, and', 'building a fast feedback loop from ideas to production.']"

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) implements DevOps principles with an extra focus on production and operations. It can help companies to ramp up new ways of working, lower operational costs, boost development speed, and increase the business value of services you are creating.', 'Let‚Äôs face it: operating IT services is hard to get right by accident. For one, it‚Äôs very labor-intensive, and the costs can get high: after all, an estimated 40‚Äì90% of a service‚Äôs total cost of ownership is incurred after it is launched. Downtime and production issues can affect end-user happiness and eventually business. Brittle production hurts your employees as well: no one wants to wake up in the middle of the night to fight fires.', 'You can gain short-term cost savings by outsourcing and externalizing the problem. However, this usually comes with downsides. First and foremost, there‚Äôs the communication barrier between dev and ops, a lack of end-to-end visibility, and the endless responsibility ping-pong. On top of that, long waiting times for non-critical requests and decreased reliability are also possible side effects.', 'All of these hurt either end-user satisfaction or the speed at which you can develop new business features ‚Äì or both, which eventually hurts your business without fail.', 'DevOps has had a huge role in fixing many of these issues in software development in many ways, such as:', 'Credit where credit is due ‚Äì all these are known to greatly increase the ROI of service development. But in reality, the problems seldom end there.', 'One commonly overlooked phenomenon is that DevOps teams tend to be more mature on the dev side than ops. Cloud, security and overall operations knowledge might be quite low in any given DevOps team, which may lead to problems with reliability, scalability, and automation. Handling production is one feat and most DevOps teams can handle that. Handling production well while simultaneously optimizing the end-user journey, increasing development speed, reducing manual work, preemptively fixing production issues before they happen and doing that data-driven way is another story.', 'Additionally, even when the DevOps team itself works efficiently, it might still depend on an internal or outsourced ops team which creates a bottleneck and lowers the velocity of all teams that rely on it.', 'Read more - what is a devops engineer and what do they do?', 'When the number of autonomous DevOps teams increases, new challenges arise. Teams are very effective at building new business features and looking after their own service, but all the work that would help other teams might get deprioritized as it falls out of the scope of the team. This leads to a situation where teams reinvent the wheel and solve the same problems in too many ways. Without a centralized platform team or the culture of using a chunk of teams‚Äô velocity to help other teams to flourish, the overall velocity starts dropping.', 'Site reliability engineering (SRE) is a paradigm that emphasizes the Ops part in the DevOps and does that using Dev practices. It both speeds up the development and brings the ops back in the spotlight. Rather than treating ops simply as a minimizable cost, it instead views it as a strategic investment that enables and maximizes business value, developer productivity, and end-user satisfaction.', 'SRE‚Äôs key benefits can be summarized into two distinct areas: faster development speed and smoother operations and services.', 'Teams applying SRE practices are able to spend more of their time developing better services. This is possible because SRE takes a stance on reducing manual work, called ‚Äútoil‚Äù. Anything that needs manual intervention and is repetitive, is a candidate for removal. SREs use engineering practices to get rid of toil. Any means which helps to reduce toil is used, be it building automation, increasing reliability, improving alerting, or removing the need altogether with a process change. SREs invest time to create even more time in the future.', 'As the need for manual operations works decreases, more time is left for development. This helps to speed up the feature development speed, which is good news for the business. Business is not the only winner, as developers welcome the fact they can spend more time on doing development which they love. The group which wins the most is the user of the service.', 'SRE is built around end-user happiness. It measures, manages, and optimizes the service for end-users, be they internal or external, as that is what matters the most.', 'SRE does not reinvent the wheel but builds on top of DevOps best practices. Any team familiar with DevOps can evolve to the SRE way of working.', 'Make no mistake ‚Äì unlocking the benefits of SRE is a gradual process rather than instantaneous. It starts with understanding what SRE means in your context and picking the most suitable model and only then proceeding to roll out and ramp up the new way of working.

This is exactly why it is more important than ever to know how to stand out from the rest and help us recruiters recognise your potential. ', 'To help you succeed and land the tech job opportunity of your dreams, we have put together a short and sweet list of tips to keep in mind when applying for a job. Before we dive into the details, here‚Äôs the bottom line:', 'Now, without further ado, let‚Äôs take a closer look at what this means in practice:', 'At the first stage of the recruitment process, the hiring team is primarily focused on deciding who will be selected for interviews. A key part of winning them over is to make that decision as easy as possible for them by providing the right materials and answering the questions they‚Äôre interested in.', 'You can think of sharing your story as sitting around an imaginary campfire where you can tell about your past and reflect on your career highlights, future plans and motivation towards the company you‚Äôre applying to. Take some time to write a few paragraphs about what is important for you and how that might match with Futurice to convey your expectations and help the recruiters decide whether to call you in for an interview.', 'One of the most commonly used methods to deliver your story is your cover letter. It is appreciated by companies around the world, and it is not only beneficial for them but also for you. Keep in mind that the people reading through your application are your future colleagues, and they are not just interested to see your technical skills but also your motivation and your interest in becoming their team member. That is why it is sometimes also known as a motivation letter. Your story helps us decide on an interview offer. If you get called in, you are likely to get more out of the discussion as the interviewers can also prepare for the interview better, having read your story.', 'If you start creating your story from scratch, one tip is to list the requirements mentioned in the job posting as a guideline for yourself. After that, you can go through each point and reflect on how they match your situation. Our recommendation is to contextualise your experience rather than just list skills. The context can be a work task, project, role or hobby, for example. If you do not have a ton of experience yet, you can emphasise your learning interests instead. Share things that we can‚Äôt see in your CV. Don‚Äôt assume that the recruiter knows what kinds of challenges you‚Äôre looking for and what kind of relevant experience you might have.', 'To help you land that interview, here is a list of questions we recommend you to answer in your application.', 'If there are additional details you would like us to know about you that might affect your application, this is a great place to mention them as well. Consider the following, for example:', 'As a general rule, write your application in the same language that the job listing uses. For example, if your native language is Finnish and you‚Äôre applying for a position based in Finland, don‚Äôt let that affect your decision ‚Äì always go with the language used in the job listing. This applies even if you‚Äôre certain someone in the recruiting team understands Finnish ‚Äì there may be others involved in the decision that don‚Äôt. Think of it as a great opportunity to show off your language skills.', 'A job application is not the same as an essay, and recruiters typically have tons of applications to go through in a fairly limited amount of time. They have to make decisions relatively fast ‚Äì so brevity is key, and first impressions matter. With that in mind, you can do a lot with different methods and formatting choices to help the recruiter to recognise your core strengths.', 'You can think of this as optimising the user experience of your application. This is not rocket science, and the tricks to deliver relevant information about your history and future interests more efficiently are fairly simple. Consider for example using formatting (such as bold text) to highlight important keywords, creating structure with headlines, organising information with bullet points, and using links where necessary. All these help you say a lot about yourself without writing a long text that contains everything under the sun.', 'Once you have a first draft ready, don‚Äôt say you‚Äôre done yet. At Futurice, we love feedback, and it‚Äôs always a good idea to ask a close friend or family member for their opinion. Does the cover letter present you well and is it easy to read, and can they understand it even if they‚Äôre not familiar with your field of expertise? If your application includes referrals from people who know you professionally, they can be a great source of feedback as well.', 'When recruiters are hiring new talent, they‚Äôre looking for more than just faceless resources, or pairs of hands to allocate to different tasks and projects. What they‚Äôre after is a team member, and in our business, those tend to be living, breathing human beings complete with a unique personality.', 'So, as people trying to find a new teammate, we‚Äôre not only interested in your skills ‚Äì we are just as eager to know who you are and what you‚Äôre like to work with. To help us see that, let your personality show in your application. This is a major part of standing out if there are other people applying for the same job as you.

Consider including information that is unique to you, such as:', 'Early on in your career you may not have a lot to share in this area. Don‚Äôt let that discourage you!

Here are some other things to emphasise if you‚Äôre still in the beginning of your professional journey:', 'And since we‚Äôve been talking about personality, there‚Äôs one more important thing to mention here. In some cases, having a personality is misinterpreted as being overly extroverted and able to constantly broadcast your personal brand. Don‚Äôt fall for that ‚Äì be yourself.

A recent survey shows that DevOps will remain in high demand and states that by 2026, the DevOps market will be worth $14.9 billion (over ‚Ç¨13 billion).', ' Recent study by Fortune Business Insights‚Ñ¢ titled, ""DevOps Market"".', 'So what exactly is DevOps? It‚Äôs complicated. DevOps is not necessarily a specific set of tools or processes but rather a key set of ideas and practices in modern software development that enable the fast, stable and more frequent releases of software. It achieves this through optimizing the release cycle of the software, improving software development practices, improving automation and bringing transparency to the release process.', 'But to really understand what DevOps is and why it is so important, we need to look at the ideas and principles that DevOps was built on. This begins by looking a little into the history of software development.', 'In the early days of software development, the software release process was similar to the hardware it ran on. Mistakes in hardware are expensive (or impossible) to change once released and the impacts of mistakes can be huge. The software release process mirrored this and releases were meticulously planned, carefully built into products before being tested and finally, when it was ready (or ready enough), released on physical media to end users.', 'But software is not hardware - it can be constantly changed and rebuilt cheaply.', 'Throughout the 1990s, software developers were seeing the problems with these inflexible development processes and starting finding ways to improve the software release cycle. This is often seen as culminating with the 2001 release of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, which combined many of these ideas into a set of principles to guide teams and businesses on how to become more efficient at building software.', 'Agile practices and how they can be implemented is a whole topic in itself, but for the purpose of this article we can look at the key aspects that agile development brought:', 'Throughout the 2000s, agile development (including frameworks such as Scrum, Extreme Programming, Kanban etc) grew in popularity with teams using short, adaptable iterations to construct software. To optimize their workflows, teams also started using Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD) and test automation frameworks.', 'Continuous integration is the process of taking changes from developers and merging them as early as possible into the main product code. This is also coupled with automated testing, so that each of the changes are individually tested and the overall quality of the software is always understood. A natural extension to CI is Continuous Delivery, where the automation and testing tools were extended to include automatically building releasable units of software.', 'All of this tooling shared a common goal: decrease the time taken for teams to see the impact their changes had on the product as a whole. The optimization of this feedback loop reinforced the mindset to automate the whole release process to make it as efficient as possible. The optimization of this feedback loop set the foundation for DevOps methodologies.', ""Combining the development teams' agile mindset, capability to incrementally build software and the growth of the internet and SaaS platforms throughout the 2000s led to the formation of DevOps. It took the ideas of agile development, including continuous integration and delivery, but expanded to encompass the whole release cycle."", 'This goal became known as ‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù, a term formed from bridging the gap between the development of software and its operation (i.e. its deployment and monitoring for end users). It aimed to provide the answer on how to deploy software updates that bring value to end users quickly and transparently whilst retaining high quality.', 'As an extension of the general principles of agile software development, the DevOps methodologies were similar but allowed the whole organization, including developers, project stakeholders, testers and operations, to understand the overall release process and work more effectively together.', 'DevOps took the CI & CD tools and made them broader in scope to automate the complete building, testing, release and deployment of software (known as Continuous Deployment and confusingly also referred to as CD). This DevOps tooling takes code changes from a developer, feeds them into one end of an automated pipeline and pushes software updates out of the other. This focus on continuously deploying software also led to an evolution in software architecture, where systems were designed to be easily deployable, configurable and recoverable.', 'Finally, the growth of internet connected products & services also meant that real-time monitoring of production software was possible. This provided a lot of transparency into the released state of the software and gave developers visibility into the impact of any released software updates.', 'Even after a decade, DevOps is still evolving and a critical aspect of modern software development. It is a culture born on agility and failing fast. The influence of DevOps can be seen in other modern methodologies such as DataOps in the data science domain and MLOps for machine learning.', 'More concretely, DevOps provides the practices and frameworks that guide the organization focused on software releases to collaborate through transparency and visibility into the whole release pipeline. This transparency leads to measurable ways to optimize the release process which in turn allows organizations to iterate on new ideas faster and adapt to change.', 'DevOps influences software architecture as modern solutions are chosen and designed in a way that allows for the continuous deployment of the software. The huge ecosystem of DevOps tooling allows organizations to understand the state of their software releases and feed these findings back into the development process.', 'The importance of DevOps cannot be understated as it brings a fundamental mindset that encourages iterative learning. This ability to try new things, quickly observe what works and what doesn‚Äôt drives an innovative mindset within teams and organizations.', ""The good news is that DevOps is a set of ideologies and approaches that you can start working with straight away. There is no rigid end state, no question of ‚ÄúAre we DevOps yet?‚Äù, no mandatory tools. It starts with the goal of optimizing the software release cycle and grows from there. Depending on the organization's size & needs, the integration of DevOps tools and methodologies may be handled by developers, individual DevOps engineers or dedicated DevOps teams."", 'To get started with DevOps, ask the following questions:', 'DevOps is a broad and sometimes difficult topic to describe. It is built upon decades of software development practices and there is no single way of implementing its ideologies.

As companies hesitate to adopt more inclusive language policies, they pay a heavy price ‚Äì without necessarily even realizing it.', 'Even in relatively international business hubs throughout Europe, organizations with English as their corporate language are still typically in the minority ‚Äì and by a considerable margin.', 'While some companies are able to adapt their language requirements to welcome international professionals, this group is relatively limited. The harsh reality is that many organizations are still constrained by a culture that doesn‚Äôt offer much in terms of flexibility or willingness to accommodate exceptions. The most unfortunate cases are categorically opposed to the very idea of changing their language policy.', 'It‚Äôs hardly a surprise, then, that for example in Finland, international professionals see strict language requirements as the largest career obstacle affecting them. But why exactly is that the case? Experts seem to agree that reluctance to step out of the comfort zone and make arrangements is a good guess; outdated attitudes and conscious or unconscious biases ‚Äì sometimes even outright prejudices ‚Äì are another.', 'But that‚Äôs not all there is to it. A 2021 study commissioned by Finland‚Äôs largest private staffing agency Barona suggests that the lack of adequate English skills on the employer‚Äôs part is also a substantial contributing factor. Nearly 40% of the companies surveyed were not ready to accommodate English as a working language.', 'Three out of four companies in Finland suffer from a shortage of available talent, but at the same time, nearly half of the affected companies insist that international employees speak native-level Finnish. Connecting the dots presented here shouldn‚Äôt be particularly hard, but the requirements still don‚Äôt seem to budge.', 'Futurice has increasingly invested in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts over the past few years. Using English as our company language is a key part of offering an inclusive working environment, and it also helps us reach a much wider group of potential recruits. The main reason for us to promote this topic is to actively help and encourage other organizations to benefit from making the same move.', 'Cherry-picking potential hires based on their language skills rather than their proficiency in the field they‚Äôve mastered is massively shortsighted. In doing so, organizations are actively limiting their access to the talent pool. Especially in fields heavily affected by the shortage of talent, this can have far-reaching consequences.', 'But things seem to be changing, albeit slowly. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the change has started from the most severely throttled domains ‚Äì such as software engineering or design ‚Äì where the educational pipeline simply can‚Äôt keep up with the demand of the labor market. Out of necessity, organizations have had to come to the conclusion that language does indeed come second, and professional skills, especially when in high demand, matter most.', 'What may surprise you, though, is that for example in Finland, public sector organizations are actually driving this change. The Barona study"") (report available only in Finnish, ironically) found that four fifths of the public sector organizations surveyed did in fact employ international talent, making them more international than private companies.', 'Karoline Kwon moved to Finland in 2013 to study new media design at Aalto University. She has since worked at a number of Finnish organizations, all the way from startups to large enterprises like KONE.

After that initial decision, the practice of hiring international talent has spread out into other functions as well.‚Äù', 'The shift has not gone unnoticed in other parts of VR‚Äôs organization, and it has been easy to accept. Given the nature and importance of the strategic problems they are solving, the necessity of international talent is not questioned.', '‚ÄúGood experiences with the first teams helped us build a nice momentum, which, in turn, has made it easier to reinforce the practice and do the same elsewhere. It‚Äôs also much easier for us to work with our partners, many of which have international professionals in their teams. We have been able to put together really high-performing teams, and we are very satisfied with the outcome,‚Äù Schugk praises.', 'Building the momentum is also massively beneficial from the perspective of international employees. Karoline Kwon notes that the change at Posti really picked up the pace when Angelos Arnis joined the design team as the second non-Finnish-speaking person.', '\nAngelos Arnis', '‚ÄúWhen Angelos joined, it made things so much easier. He helped amplify the positive impacts of diversity and change. It took a lot of the pressure off being the only non-Finnish speaker, and we were able to start building the momentum for that change and go, ‚ÄòHey, could we be more inclusive here?‚Äô whenever there was room for improvement,‚Äù Kwon says.', 'In the next hiring round, new people pushed the Posti design team to a 50-50 split between Finnish-speaking and international employees, which made it easier to continue in that trajectory and keep converting the team‚Äôs work into English.', '‚ÄúA lot of employers still have Finnish as a job requirement without really questioning it. In reality, it‚Äôs just one skill of the many someone can offer in a role. During my two years at Posti, there were few cases where Finnish hindered me or our team‚Äôs work to create positive change. In the end, we always found a way to work together and use our diverse skills to support one another,‚Äù Karoline Kwon reflects.', 'And that‚Äôs the thing ‚Äì naturally, language does still matter in some roles, but certainly not all of them. At VR, Marika Schugk points out, customers expect to get service in Finnish or Swedish for example when dealing with customer service agents or train conductors.', '‚ÄúBut the work of software engineers and designers is very different in comparison. It‚Äôs fairly universal and independent of language, and there‚Äôs typically no need to interact directly with the customers. Whenever we need usability testing, for example, we can translate the feedback so that our teams understand it,‚Äù Schugk says.', 'When making changes to things like a company‚Äôs language policy, there‚Äôs bound to be some friction. In Angelos Arnis‚Äô experience, adjusting to new ways is usually harder for the people with more years of service under their belt.', '‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked at a couple of companies in Finland, and when it comes to attitudes towards language, things depend a lot on how many people have been at a company ‚Äòforever‚Äô. It can be a pretty steep hill to climb with people who have been there for ages,‚Äù Arnis says.', 'Karoline Kwon has a very similar impression based on her past experiences.', '‚ÄúThe longer you‚Äôre used to working in a certain way, the harder it is to change, or even want to. Sometimes people didn‚Äôt reply to me if I wrote in English or acted like I could understand when I really couldn‚Äôt,‚Äù Kwon says.', 'Arnis has faced no issues with language at Posti, but his observations at previous workplaces suggest that if there‚Äôs just one non-Finnish-speaking person involved, people are more prone to just keep having meetings and doing things in Finnish.', '‚ÄúI‚Äôve sometimes been the only English speaker in a meeting that was held in Finnish, so I would just have to sit and go through my emails while waiting for the others to finish, and then get a summary from someone afterward,‚Äù Arnis says.', 'Both Arnis and Kwon chalk the successful language shift at Posti up to one thing in particular: an exceptionally skilled supervisor. He had tons of experience working with international teams, and he was very pro-diversity in the one he steered.', '‚ÄúHe had previously worked at Google, and when he joined Posti, he simply started to hire the best people in design who could do what the company needed. He would never consider language as a restriction,‚Äù Arnis says.', '‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge motivational boost when you don‚Äôt have to justify being able to understand what‚Äôs going on around you,‚Äù he adds.', 'Similar trends have also been recognized at VR.', '‚ÄúOur product owners have been accustomed to working in large global teams, and that‚Äôs a big benefit. Working in English comes very naturally to them, and that has helped us drive and expand that change,‚Äù VR‚Äôs Marika Schugk says.', '\nMarika Schugk', 'But as talented as a supervisor or product owner may be, their reach only goes so far. In a large organization, it is absolutely mandatory for upper management to be committed to the change as well.', '‚ÄúSomething like this requires a considerable change in mindset, and it takes a lot of leadership effort to demand and ensure that the chosen language sticks. There‚Äôs a huge difference between just letting things run their course, and actually nurturing the decision you‚Äôve made and ensuring that it‚Äôs honored throughout the organization,‚Äù Schugk argues.', '‚ÄúThere are countless details to take into account ‚Äì for example, paying attention to having sufficient language skills on the supervisor and product owner level, and offering support for those who want to brush up on their English.‚Äù', 'Embracing international teams isn‚Äôt exactly a cakewalk, as we‚Äôve established by now. It takes plenty of effort to get things to run smoothly, and there is a wide range of pitfalls to look out for at the same time. This begs the question ‚Äì why should organizations go through all that trouble in the first place?', 'One of the main reasons that comes up time and time again is the connection between a team‚Äôs diversity and its creativity and capability to innovate. Both Karoline Kwon and Angelos Arnis seem to agree with that notion, arguing that a fresh perspective is a considerable strength in any creative task.', '‚ÄúHaving different experiences and perspectives can contribute a lot to your perception. When you‚Äôre not used to the way things are done here, you have a great way of seeing and solving problems in different ways,‚Äù Karoline Kwon says.', 'The real impact comes when you multiply those perspectives, and end up with an amalgamation of different viewpoints:', '‚ÄúDiversity comes from the fact that you can combine all these different cultures and perspectives together. If an organization is predominantly Finnish, and you add all these people with their own backgrounds on top of that, it‚Äôs a unique opportunity because they apply their expertise from a different point of view,‚Äù Angelos Arnis says.', 'Experts have also found a correlation between the diversity of a team and its performance. When you consider this from the language angle, the implication is fairly obvious: If you are willing to hire international talent, your options open up drastically. You can hire from all over the world, not just the local talent pool.', '‚ÄúBeing able to welcome the best professionals out there into our teams is the biggest advantage there is. There‚Äôs already a massive shortage of talent in the software industry, and digitalization is certainly not slowing down. There‚Äôs just no way we can train enough people in Finland alone to meet the demand,‚Äù Marika Schugk says.', 'And really, when you think about it, language is just one of many skills and characteristics that you might be looking for in a candidate. Are you really going to let one thing hold you back from hiring a great candidate? And can you afford to do so?', '‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to lose by hiring international talent, but so much to gain. If you consider individuals, there are so many more skills beyond language that a person can contribute to your organization ‚Äì not to mention their unique motivations, interests and perspectives,‚Äù Karoline Kwon sums up.', '‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt stay in your own bubble forever, because there‚Äôs no space to grow there. And it‚Äôs a horrible excuse to not want to change because you‚Äôre afraid or you think it‚Äôs going to be a hassle.‚Äù', 'Founded in Helsinki, Finland in 2000, Futurice has used English as its official language since 2007. At the beginning of 2022, we employed more than 650 professionals representing 52 nationalities. In Finland alone, 14% of our headcount consists of international employees covering 38 different nationalities.']",[]

Here is a short introduction to NFTs on what you should know about NFTs and why you should care.', 'About me: When I first encountered digital media and web art back in the ‚Äò90s I knew this was going to be my thing. And it was ‚Äì for about a decade ‚Äì then the limitations of exhibiting, selling, and archiving work started to get to me, and I went back to painting for a while, which was on many levels very satisfying (monetization being one of them). Still, I never stopped being fascinated with new technology, so when beeple‚Äôs $69,3 million sale catapulted NFTs into public awareness, it caught my attention. On a quest to learn more I found myself drawn into a complex web of issues, positions, and considerations, in which technology is arguably the least important.', 'This was a question many people had when NFTs suddenly emerged seemingly out of nowhere. It was the topic of numerous podcasts and articles. This SNL sketch sums it up very nicely.', 'NFT stands for Non Fungible Token *. Even though NFTs could be just about anything, they have in the public eye become synonymous with digital art. They are a type of cryptocurrency and represent a specific item (usually digital art or computer game artifacts). By certifying uniqueness NFTs create artificial scarcity for items notoriously very fungible ‚Äì something easily replaced by an identical copy indistinguishable from the ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô. With the purchase of an NFT you take ‚Äúownership‚Äù of the item it points to. This item could be a piece of digital art, a digitized photo of non-digital art, an accessory in a game, or any other type of thing that normally is considered easy to replicate and, therefore, absolutely not unique.', 'It is important to point out that it is not very clear what exactly such ownership consists of. The NFT is just a token, not the thing itself, so if someone turns off the server the asset resides on or alters the item, all you own is a digital link. The people who came up with the idea of NFTs did so at a hackathon in 2014 and could not find a solution for how to secure the actual item, so they used a temporary fix of merely referencing its location. This shortcut is still in place now and very few people seem deterred by it. But questions of ownership, copyright, and quality were not what was driving the hype.', 'For the art community it was the promise of a democratized art market, and the question of the moment became: ‚ÄúSo have you minted an NFT yet?‚Äù', 'The first major damper to the general enthusiasm was the realization that minting and selling an NFT on a POW (proof of work) blockchain ^ was about as energy intensive as powering a family home for a couple of months. With the world rapidly sliding into man-made climate disaster, minting NFTs of one‚Äôs work and making profit by helping to destroy the planet seemed hard to justify. At this point in the discussion, NFT enthusiasts will tell you that there are greener options, that Etherium itself will be clean in no time at all, (it was supposed to be ‚Äúgreen‚Äù already a couple of years ago), and that the banking industry and other evil forces produce just as much energy, or more. While all this is true, with this energy the entire banking industry handles billions of transactions for billions of people, while cryptocurrencies are still used by only a small fraction of the population. If the world‚Äôs entire population were using cryptocurrencies, we would run into massive energy shortages, and other serious problems. Strangely and disappointingly, the greener alternatives ( proof of stake = POS based blockchains ^ ) are not really catching on, possibly due to an unwillingness to convert or an instinctive belief that high energy inefficiency is somehow associated with value, or simply fear of the new.', 'NFTs were proposed as an answer to a variety of problems, and offer a solution for:\nMarketability: Thanks to the rise of the Non Fungible Token, there now is a way to commodify previously difficult-to-market assets. With the NFT narrative we can create a marketplace for just about anything. \nCredibility/visibility: Finally digital art is being considered a serious investment.\nOwnership: is trackable, and the history of ownership is verified.', 'This last point is a segue into the issues NFTs have yet to address:\nCopyright: Not only has this issue not been solved, but it has been complicated even further: The person selling and profiting off the NFT is the creator or owner of the NFT, not necessarily the creator of the artwork it refers to. Countless artists have been complaining about having their work stolen (including the estates of dead ones).\nRoyalties: It is often claimed that the smart contracts underlying NFTs will ensure that the original creator receives royalties in case of a resale. And while this CAN in fact work, it is not a given as there are many ways around it. The smartness of a smart contract turns out to be very limited. The smartness and integrity of the people involved is another point of contention.\nElitism: Another big one - the problem of the impenetrable art market. Now that anyone can sell their NFTs on a platform like OpenSea, we should finally have achieved total democracy, a level playing field, opportunity for all. However, the data we now have on who sells what suggest that 10% of the participants are responsible for 90% of transactions - pretty much replicating the real-world art market.', 'It depends on what we mean by safe. But actually, no.', 'There still are open legal questions, such as how data protection laws apply to a blockchain, where nothing can be deleted. There is very little regulation around this market, theft and scams (especially rug pulls) are frequent and most often have little or no negative consequences for the fraudster. Also, NFTs can contain malware, so any offer of a ‚Äúfree‚Äù NFT should be treated with caution. Another very common risk is that people lose access to their wallet by losing their access key, and chances are this wallet is lost forever‚Äìwhich is tragic because, ironically, there are aspects of this technology that are very safe. And with the loss of your wallet, there goes your art collection.', 'Speaking of the technology - as Tante puts it: ‚ÄúNFTs are technologically stupid. That‚Äôs just what any person working in digital media or any reasonable engineer will tell you ‚Äì if they are not trying to scam you of course. If you look at the facts, the properties of the thing, there‚Äôs nothing of substance there but exploitation in the same vein that we have seen in games with microtransactions.‚Äù', 'One of the main selling points of NFTs is that they run on a blockchain ‚Äì the technology that is the basis for anything to do with cryptocurrency. It is not that new, but until the invention of BitCoin there had not been much application for it. A blockchain engineer explained that the only use case he could think of was deregulated, decentralized cryptocurrency and nothing else. If any party involved in a transaction can be considered trustworthy, then in pretty much every scenario a database would be a more efficient alternative. The only case in which a decentralized system is necessary is if no one can be trusted at all ‚Äì otherwise it is unnecessarily wasteful. (This view, held by a number of software engineers, is discussed in more detail here.) And even though many very smart people have been trying to find an application for it, so far none have been convincing.', 'With this in mind, the hype around it and the rise of crypto-anything is positively dystopian. Still, the belief that the technology must somehow revolutionise the world is pervasive, something Stephen Diehl calls Blockchainism. And there just might be a use case - but we yet have to find it.', 'One of the most fundamental questions is what NFTs can bring to the table that could not be solved by traditional methods. There have been attempts at selling non physical art before. Tino Sehgal (who studied both dance and economics) has successfully sold many a performance using (appropriately) the form of a verbal contract.', 'However, it was not until 2021 and the sudden rise of NFTs that the marketability of immaterial art took off. Galleries now both show and sell digital art - but why they didn‚Äôt in the past was not for lack of technology. The new trend is related to a societal shift rather than technological advances. A Berlin net-art gallery admitted that the sale of an NFT was largely symbolic. With the purchase of an NFT, the buyer was able to show his appreciation while supporting the artist and the gallery.', 'They agreed that people could have supported the artists all along by sending them actual money in exchange for a real life token, like a postcard or free entry to a show - yet they didn‚Äôt. But with the NFTs suddenly they do.', 'All the NFTs at the gallery except for one ran on the Ethereum blockchain, even though most artists at this point are aware of the energy consumption and the availability of greener options. This was most likely for financial reasons, and at least in part because of ‚Äúthe community‚Äù.', 'The way ‚Äúthe community‚Äù is referred (and deferred) to gives it a mythical air - just short of sounding like a cult. It feels like you are either part of the community or you are an uninitiated outsider. Calling it ‚Äúthe‚Äù community is just as misleading as talking about ‚Äúthe‚Äù blockchain. There are many blockchains and many so-called communities, but pretending that there is just one serves to add authority while at the same time shrouding it in mystery.', ""The community is an essential part of NFT culture. There are in fact many communities, exclusive to varying degrees. The community in general is the interaction between people interested in NFTs. Post-mint, the community revolves around a specific NFT project ‚Äì often only open to those who can afford to buy into it. The quality of the community around an NFT project can make or break it. The community offers psychological, social, financial and, of course, marketing support by buying, trading, and pushing each other's NFTs, so starting a community around your work usually precedes the actual minting.There are now agencies offering support in setting up communities and help in selling NFTs. \nOne of the biggest and most well known is the Bored Ape Yacht Club. If you are an Ape holder you have access to real life meet ups with fellow Apes, events and presales ‚Äì not to mention the support and encouragement of 10000 others who assure you that you are doing the right thing. Quite possibly this membership is what you are actually buying when investing in an NFT. It‚Äôs the equivalent of what used to be an exclusive  golf club membership. The communities mainly communicate on Discord, Twitter, and Instagram, but also any other social media platform. Posts are generally vague and very optimistic, comments are so affirmative that it‚Äôs hard to picture real people behind the profiles. \nCovid-19 almost certainly exacerbated the need for virtual community and digital art -  as nft now CEO Matt Medved at Art Basel put it: ‚ÄúHow much time do you spend looking at your wall compared to how much time you spend looking at your screen?‚Äù"", 'It is undebatable that nowadays screen time far exceeds wall time, but what kind of art are we staring at? One should never generalise, and there are always outstanding and very creative works of art in every medium and on almost any platform. But what is being pushed on social media and in the marketplaces is, in almost all cases I have seen in the wild, amateurish, self-referential, and heavy handed ripoffs of some project that was, financially, highly successful ‚Äì despite being questionable in terms of its artistic value. Therefore references to cryptocurrencies and cryptoconventions are at least as common as apes and pixelated portraits. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a host of war related images got minted. Not to accuse anyone of being opportunistic here, it still shows how instantaneous this kind of art is. Instantly produced, minted, and sold. To be a runaway success √° la Bored Ape, time needs to be invested into building the community and positioning the product properly. But even more so than in the real-world  art market, algorithms and stakeholders influence the success and visibility of NFTs in these virtual marketplaces, with quality often being an afterthought.', 'Even though some think that web3 is bullshit, and even the original creators of the NFT concept are disillusioned with how it ended up being used, it probably isn‚Äôt going to go away any time soon. Commerce has found a new way to sell things they previously couldn‚Äôt, and even though H&M‚Äôs plans to offer outfits as NFTs, so you could dress up your avatar in the metaverse, ended up being a joke - it does make a lot of sense, and many people bought the idea.Cryptocurrency is rapidly infiltrating the mainstream, and there are many more issues to be talked about there. It probably is not going to go away, but hopefully in our excitement we will still try to address the problems they have not solved, and the problems they create. Even if we could download our consciousness into the metaverse and decide real life on planet earth is not worthwhile, we would still need to take care of quite a few real life issues. We might be entering a situation like the one described in ‚ÄúThe Three Stigmata Of Palmer Eldridge‚Äù by Philip K. Dick, where life on earth is so unbearable that we need to fantasize ourselves into avatars ‚Äì but we would still need to transition to this state before life on this planet has become impossible. Greener blockchains and renewable energy might be a start. Maybe we can stop driving and flying if we do most of our socialising in the metaverse.', 'There are detailed tutorials and even books on how to create NFTs and/or get started with cryptocurrency. The first thing you need to do is open a wallet, which is as easy as downloading an app from your preferred app-store. Setting it up does not involve divulging any personal information, it does not even involve buying any coins. You then connect this wallet to a marketplace of your choice  and now you are just steps away from being an art star and/or a star art collector.', 'May I suggest you start by investing in ‚ÄúUntitled Chain 1‚Äù, the NFT I created specifically for you -  any funds raised will be used to try and stop the madness.', '* Non Fungible Token: in currencies tokens are usually fungible, meaning that one can be substituted for its copy without any effects on value or recognition.

Quite rarely, I would guess.', 'But the problem is that there is no real alternative at hand. Your options are very limited: the fastest is the default, and sometimes you may have the luxury of picking the shortest route. And this is where our idea ‚Äì The Safe Route ‚Äì steps into the picture.', ""The Safe Route is a service that uses a number of relevant data sources to direct the user to ‚Äì yes, you guessed it ‚Äì the safest route. It's currently based on accident reports provided by the Swedish Transport Agency, and a preferred next step would be to add more relevant data points, such as weather, road surface and how busy various streets are. Other potential traffic hazards, such as intersections, left turns, and roundabouts, are also taken into account."", 'With The Safe Route, we wanted to use our expertise, knowledge, and methods to help increase traffic safety for cyclists and get more people to pick the bike as their choice of vehicle. If we get there, we will have succeeded.', 'Does society benefit from more people switching to cycling? Yes, in several ways: Bicycles do not emit any carbon dioxide and they reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. On top of that, they contribute to a positive development of public health and help make cities less congested.', 'This is not the first time we involve ourselves in a project intending to contribute to the benefit of society ‚Äì see for example how we‚Äôve used a robot to help teach autistic children sign language, or created a service to help consumers make more sustainable choices.', 'We want The Safe Route to have a long life and develop over time. And we know from experience that a successful outcome depends on the contribution of insights, ideas, and knowledge from people with other areas of expertise.', 'So please give The Safe Route a try, and if you have an idea on how to make an even bigger impact with it, please give us a call ‚Äì we want to do this together!']",[]

In this blog we discuss some tools for taking future thinking and strategic foresight into action.', 'Disruption is inevitable in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world. We can talk about micro-level risks   or opportunities such as the ones listed in technology trend reports by agencies, and massive risks of magnitude, such as the pandemics. Based on our experience, organizations need guidance in terms of prioritization and execution. This is why a Future Thinking process is a necessity. The only way to make future-proof decisions is to boldly imagine a concrete future world together with actors from the same value network, and backcast and define an action plan to get there.', 'Businesses need to understand the long-term impacts of today‚Äôs phenomena. Systematic future thinking and strategic foresight are the keys to this understanding. The traditional macro-environmental analysis method like environmental scanning, i.e. going through political, economical, societal, legal, technological and environmental drivers of change, gives us an overview of what is happening. Scanning the environment to see what‚Äôs there is, of course, important, but feeling what isn‚Äôt is just as vital. By spotting both patterns we see and what we cannot see, we can start creating a holistic picture of what future phenomena stand out. To do this, we can use both existing data and our instincts. The former we do by utilizing big data and machine learning, the latter by feeling our way. A forecaster Faith Popcorn calls the technique ‚Äúcultural brailing‚Äô - feeling the bumps.', 'After scanning the horizon and mapping out the key trends, themes and topics, building different scenarios for the future worlds, helps us make the future concrete. Scenario analysis is an essential component of future research in which scenarios of the alternative worlds that might lie ahead are built. It is a creative process in which we imagine where the drivers of change might lead us in the future and sort of  alternative futures that might lie ahead. It also helps to bridge the gap between the past and the future. Next, we connect the scenarios of the future with business strategy. This is the step in which we estimate how the business and strategy perform in different futures and use these new insights in today‚Äôs decision-making.', 'The most important part is linking the future work with today‚Äôs business. Future thinking assists us in strategic planning and communications. By taking the scenarios and the current business plans, and comparing how current key elements of the organization and the strategies perform against the future worlds, future thinking assists us in strategic planning and communications. This is what our Lean Futures Toolkit is designed to do - creating an actionable roadmap and business strategies based on the alternative futures.', ""Until recently, many companies followed the Diffusion of innovations model by Everett M Rogers, created in the 1960's for their future initiatives. The internet pretty much wiped out that whole curve. Regardless, we still feel that companies should stay true to their vision. There are many layers to observing the world and envisioning the future, and it is important to understand where your company is at. Some phenomena are fast, some are long-term. Some things change, some things stay the same. Our human minds still operate the ancient way: we want to eat, love and we search for higher meaning. Actions should be considered and decisions made with long-term consequences in mind."", 'As it is important to understand where a company is at the moment compared to the possible future worlds, it is equally important to understand the impact of the different decisions on the way towards the different futures - how are the decisions forming the steps towards future and what kind of cause and effect they might have in a long term.', 'In strategic foresight we take key topics, identify alternative outcomes and make strategic connections. Making a list of business-critical aspects, such as strategies, functions and business units, is a good idea. \nEvaluate their impact. Cross-reference how the current set-up holds against the future scenarios. Are our key functions weak, neutral or strong? When the strategic connections have been found, consider how to improve the weakest performing areas, with the company vision and position in mind. Finally, make a list of actions to commit to and evaluate our actions on a systemic level. What is the economic, social and environmental impact of the solutions? And what are the risks? A company can always decide to play against the results of the comparison, but it should be a conscious choice, not one based on ignorance.', 'Interested in future research and strategic foresight methods.

Their business models and market approach tend to differ from the more established companies ‚Äì but just how big of a generation gap is there, really? Let‚Äôs find out in this final instalment of our series on turning digital footprint data into actionable industry insight.', 'Over the past few months, we‚Äôve been experimenting with public digital footprint data to figure out how we can better understand our clients through sources like their capital market day materials, social media, open job positions and patent data.', 'So far, we‚Äôve run three experiments, the first one looking at sustainability-related messaging in social media content and investor materials, and the other two comparing the sustainability agendas of Europe‚Äôs largest energy providers ‚Äì through the lenses of their open job positions and patent data. This time, to conclude this series, we‚Äôre doing a quick experiment to find out how these big players compare with the new kids on the block.', 'We collected all the recent social media posts from two energy startups ‚Äì Octopus and OVO ‚Äì and compared them with those of our energy giants from the past two experiments. A number of noteworthy differences stood out across three themes:', '', 'While this sample only covers a total of 2,000 posts, the differences are rather significant.', 'We then looked into the context of the relevant posts ‚Äì which we‚Äôve learned is always a vital step in these analyses. As it turns out, matches for ""lean"" might just mean that they‚Äôre talking about cleaning a lot, so you have to be careful.', 'A clear tone was present across most of the posts from the new-school providers:', 'One post shines a spotlight on an employee who is the ‚Äúbrains in charge of helping other companies adopt our agile tech and culture,‚Äù while another talks of the company‚Äôs ‚Äúcommitment to building a truly diverse community and an inclusive culture where everyone can thrive because they are valued.‚Äù', 'They laud how their ‚Äúsustainable technology helps to improve social welfare‚Äù and how they can ‚Äúbuild #mobility back in the post #COVID recovery in a way that optimises the economic, social and environmental benefits while we continue on our path to #decarbonisation.‚Äù', 'And so on ‚Äì you get the idea. A healthy dose of hot air, sure, but it‚Äôs a compelling, modern message, and it‚Äôs jumping out everywhere. Yet, where the big energy companies are concerned, this kind of messaging is something we rarely see.', 'To find out whether the difference in outward-facing messaging is also reflected on these companies‚Äô talent hunt, we took a closer look at how their open job positions compare:', '', 'Here we can notice an even clearer split. For Octopus and OVO, their hiring profile looks remarkably close to that of a tech company (we should know). Compared to the more established energy companies, the new kids are seeking lots of software developers, cloud experts as well as data scientists or engineers, and they‚Äôre placing a much stronger emphasis on customer service. They‚Äôre also actively hiring tech recruiters to help with the talent search, so this similarity to tech companies seems set to keep growing.', 'Granted, a somewhat different hiring profile is to be expected here. Octopus and OVO are focused primarily on energy retail alone, while the big providers are also involved in things like power generation and transmission, too. But the contrast is still stark ‚Äì they‚Äôre all in the retail business, yet our two new-school players are hiring almost as many data scientists as seven of Europe‚Äôs largest players combined. Let that sink in for a minute.', 'Admittedly, all this is just another weak signal ‚Äì the data is quite sparse, and further research is still needed. But what we are able to see from these new-school players sure makes them seem like modern tech companies. Given that we spend a large proportion of our time helping our clients with digital and cultural transformation, that‚Äôs a profile we‚Äôd bet our money on in the longer run. Either the larger players have some catching up to do, or they need to make sure their digital footprint better represents what they‚Äôre actually doing.', 'Through this experiment, we‚Äôve learned a lot about using the public digital footprint to generate market insight. There are many pitfalls to avoid if we want to find the real signal in among the noise. And the insights rarely tell you the whole story ‚Äì the real value comes from combining the weak signals from the data with human insight and market knowledge.', ""But the value is clear. The data gives us a new level of visibility over our market, which drives our client centricity. After this experiment, we now have a better idea of which trends to build our offering around, what our clients' challenges are, and what language they‚Äôre speaking."", 'As this capability matures, it can become part of our data and analytics offering as well ‚Äì the same sort of insights that enable our own client centricity can also enable our clients.', 'The general vibe among our team is that there‚Äôs definitely something here. What started out as a small experiment has generated quite a bit of knowledge that we believe might be of interest to the energy sector. That‚Äôs exactly why we‚Äôve decided that as our next step on this journey, we‚Äôre going to level up the insights we‚Äôve gained and refine them into a report ‚Äì covering everything we‚Äôve learned about the energy industry and the public digital footprint so far.

I am Senior Software Developer Katri Selonen. I‚Äôve worked at Futurice for six years and specialized in the healthcare sector for a personal reason: to make a real impact in an important area. Every day I learn something new. Now, I shed light on what my work is all about.', ""I believe digitalization is the key to creating the kind of impact society needs, so I decided to orient myself in the healthcare sector two and a half years ago. Currently, I work within the clients‚Äô teams with a focus on the front-end coding of an appointment system. The project also includes improving contracting services and performing user analysis. As the development processes in the healthcare sector become increasingly agile, we proceed by listening to the clients‚Äô and patients‚Äô needs and iterating solutions. My current team is multidisciplinary and consists of Futuriceans, the client's experts and third-party employees. Despite working remotely, it‚Äôs still social. I think we‚Äôve also managed to maintain a good collective spirit during the pandemic. Of course, getting new people involved is now harder, and I miss the company of my fellow workers."", 'My work in the healthcare sector has covered many other areas, like developing programming and operative tools for clients and helping them work more efficiently, thus improving customer experience. Overall, I think the pandemic has accelerated the healthcare sector‚Äôs need to create better solutions and helped it understand the value of our work. There is a lot of enthusiasm and no ready answers, making the work a journey of discovery. I think the best things about my current role are the chance to do diverse projects with diverse people, our team spirit and, of course, the nice people I get to meet and work with.', 'I am also happy to continue learning new things every day, especially about healthcare processes and customer journeys on a tangible UX level. My personal goal is to develop my in-depth experience even further and therefore make a bigger impact in the future.', 'Software development in the healthcare sector is all about balance. For example, you need to make things easy to use, but also secure. Often people can be frustrated when they feel strict regulations are standing in the way of progress, but the truth is you can do new things ‚Äì they just need to be done right. There are no shortcuts. Finding a balance between financial profitability and peoples‚Äô best interest is vital and here I think the public and private sectors still have a lot to learn from each other. Despite the fact that the healthcare sector touches all of our lives, it uses a lot of special terminology and regulations, so we need to find a balanced way to communicate between the clients and patients. And, as our work can get hectic, you need to balance your work and leisure time. Personally, I like to bake, play board and console games, do yoga and swim. At Futurice, your personal time is always appreciated.', 'I think working as a software developer in the healthcare sector is suitable for a diligent person because of the regulations and diverse needs. The ability to see things from other peoples‚Äô perspectives is also important. In the end, we code for the people and a healthier future for them. Team working skills are crucial, too, as we are often developing many different and often interlinked complex systems. An important thing to keep in mind is that working in the healthcare sector is based on building your clients‚Äô trust, so it may take time to get involved with more sensitive and regulated parts of the systems, thus impacting the system entities happens only in the longer projects.', 'Generally, I want to encourage new Futurice employees to be open-minded and interested in what‚Äôs happening around them. Experience new and different things, and discover what you are into ‚Äì it‚Äôs a journey. Futurice has many clients in many industries, and there will always be something that suits you. There are both short and long projects available, and you learn not only through education and training but by doing, too.', 'At Futurice, matching the right people with the right projects is highly valued, and what matters the most is your attitude.

While working on a partner API for our client Bromma, our team opted for using personal access tokens. This blog post takes a look at our experience and which things we had to take into account along the way.', 'Recently, the team working with our client Bromma was tasked with creating a partner API for the service we are developing. In close collaboration with Bromma, we have been building their spreader monitoring system (SMS) which is being used by ports across the globe. A spreader is a machine that moves containers, primarily from cargo ships to shore and vice versa. The system allows ports to better maintain their spreaders, which in turn improves their productivity and creates a safer work environment.', 'The partner API is an add-on to the service, designed to enable port owners to make use of the data produced by their spreader fleet. This opens up a range of possibilities for the port owner to better manage their operations. In this article we will dive into how we created this API together with Bromma, as well as which considerations we took into account ‚Äì from security and documentation to access management and monitoring.', 'APIs ‚Äì application programming interfaces ‚Äì allow systems to communicate with each other. This can improve business processes by automating workflows and adding integrations with other systems. Different kinds of APIs exist, the most common ones being private, public and partner APIs.', 'A private API is an API only accessible within a private cloud environment, such as within a VPC. It is only accessible by the organization that manages it.', 'A public API is one that is available to the general public. Its purpose is to make it as easy as possible for application developers to make use of the API, and it can be used by anyone.\nA partner API is one that is available to a partner that has been given access to it, often via a contractual agreement.', ""This article will look at how we created a partner API. First of all, it's important to understand what value can be derived from an API. Together with one of the port owners, we assessed which data was of interest. After that we started designing how this data would be made accessible through the API."", ""Since this API is available as an add-on, it's important that only customers that pay for the service have access to it. We do not want to maintain a set of API keys for the users ourselves, since everything should be automated. We found great inspiration from the GitHub API, which lets users manage their own personal access tokens (PATs)."", 'Personal access tokens (PATs) provide a secure way of managing access to an API. They give users the ability to create their own set of tokens, which can be used to access the API, shifting the responsibility of managing the keys to the user. It also makes it easy to track how often the token is used, and to revoke access if the token ends up in the wrong hands. PATs are used by companies such as GitHub, GitLab and Microsoft, to name a few.', 'Based on our experience, these are the most important things to take into account when creating a partner API using PATs:', 'PATs give us the ability to give restricted access to data in our API, so that users can only see data that belongs to them. Users can create several different PATs, each with their own permissions, as this is set by the user. Users can then revoke the access token as they wish.', 'PATs function similarly to passwords. Once a PAT is created by the user, it receives a unique identifier, which is then stored as an encrypted hash on our servers. In user authentication, the user provides their own password, but with a PAT, a unique identifier is created by the service.', 'As the user then tries to access the API, they provide their unique identifier to the server, which checks whether the PAT exists and is still valid, and that it has permission to access the requested data. Every request made to the API is logged ‚Äì this is useful because we want to trace usage patterns in case the PAT is used in a suspicious manner from a security perspective.', 'GitHub has summarized the benefits of using access tokens instead of passwords as being:', 'Unique ‚Äì tokens are specific to GitHub and can be generated per use or per device', 'Revocable ‚Äì tokens can can be individually revoked at any time without needing to update unaffected credentials', 'Limited ‚Äì tokens can be narrowly scoped to allow only the access necessary for the use case', 'Random ‚Äì tokens are not subject to the types of dictionary or brute force attempts that might threaten simpler passwords that you need to remember or enter regularly', ""It's important to think through the security aspects of the API. PATs must be created in a trusted channel, and in our case, that means using HTTPS when issuing a PAT. The PAT is also made visible to the user only once; after that the only way to see the identifier is to re-generate an identifier for the token."", 'Documentation is very important in order for application developers to easily get started with working on the API. It describes how to use the API and which endpoints are available. An industry standard for API documentation is using the OpenAPI format. It is a programming language agnostic format for describing HTTP APIs. Using it also makes it simple to host your API documentation using tools such as Swagger UI and ReDoc with ease. With Swagger UI, you can provide a testable environment where developers can test the API in their browsers, before starting to use it in their own software integrations.', 'Stripe is known for having good API documentation, with code examples and easy to follow descriptions of different functionalities. This can be a good source of inspiration when creating documentation.', 'Having monitoring in place gives you the ability to see the usage patterns of your API. This is good both from the security perspective as well as for making sure you have provisioned enough resources to handle the load. If the token is suddenly being used in a different part of the world, then the token can be revoked, and the owner can be notified. GitHub also scans the web for exposed tokens, that way they can also revoke tokens and notify token owners in case they have been compromised.', 'The above lists the most important aspects of using PATs for this purpose, but that‚Äôs not all there is to it. There are also other considerations to take into account, such as rate limits, which limit how many requests can be made for your API. Along with monitoring, this comes in handy in making sure your API is capable of handling the load that is being put on it.', 'Versioning is equally important to take into account, as you will have to think about how to update your API so that existing users can still access it when you make updates. Semantic versioning should help you with this.', 'Communicating to token owners that their tokens are about to expire ‚Äì or if a token is revoked for some reason ‚Äì is a good practice. Additionally, communicating when your API is being updated to a new major release is something to keep in mind.', 'To summarize, implementing this partner API yielded several important learnings. Using knowledge accumulated from other companies as well as from internal discussions with experienced developers meant we were able to implement a solution that successfully took into account several key factors (including how to manage access to the API in a secure manner using PATs). Additionally, it enabled us to provide a smooth developer experience with documentation that lets users easily read about the different endpoints and test them.', 'If you‚Äôre interested in the Bromma SMS API, you can read more about it here.']",[]

I don‚Äôt imitate them, but it feels natural to see how they do things and adapt this into my own work. I‚Äôve had two supervisors in my career from whom I‚Äôve learned a lot ‚Äì one of them taught me how to work collaboratively alongside clients and the other showed me how to convince stakeholders about why users should be heard and why service design matters. Both of them also believed in me when I was a little hesitant myself, encouraging me to go further in my work and take on more leadership, which is so crucial for learning.', 'New opportunities can be big career turning points, but they can also be a bit scary sometimes. In my first seven or eight years in this field I was learning constantly, but at some point I needed something new.

While taking on new roles and responsibilities can be challenging and frightening, those are also the moments that help you achieve the most.', '', 'I used to travel a lot for work, doing customer research in the USA and China. Nowadays I prefer to stay at home with my family, but working in other cultures and countries taught me a lot about design and the relevance of context, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really possible to fully understand these things without seeing different places. For example, I once visited several paper mills in China for a previous job. Being in those places, meeting the people there and understanding the context of use taught me things that no one could have ever explained to me, and it has had a lasting effect on how I do design.', 'I wanted to be a teacher when I was in high school, but I changed my mind at the last moment and applied to study economics. When I didn‚Äôt get accepted, I ended up at Tampere University of Technology, and the rest is history! This is an example of how my intuitive decisions have combined with things I couldn‚Äôt control to guide my career. The little decisions have probably ended up more important than the big ones overall, for instance choosing a project that didn‚Äôt seem like fun but offered some new things to learn. I‚Äôve often put very little thought into the decisions that have had the biggest impact on where I am today, because their importance only became clear at a later date.', 'I‚Äôve recently been teaching service design and design thinking at a university, with adult students from other professions and backgrounds. Talking with them and answering their questions has been a beneficial experience for me, as their varied perspectives challenge me to refine my understanding of the subject that I‚Äôm an expert in.

The power of consumer choice', '2. Roll-out of the charging infrastructure', '3. Leveraging the power of data', '4. Teamwork makes the dream work', '5. Support from financial institutions', 'Conclusion: People and companies working together']","['At the recent Futurice seminar, game-changing developments in the mobility sector were the subject of discussion. The speakers delivered a solutions-oriented blueprint for how the mobility sector can achieve zero-emission mobility through five key aspects that give cause for optimism.', ""If the headlines around COP26 told us anything, it's that climate change is now at the top of the global agenda, with governments under pressure to take steps right now to bring global warming under control."", ""With the news agenda understandably dominated by worrying predictions, what's crowded out are the opportunities and innovation gathering pace around the transition towards net zero. Governments may be dragging their collective feet, however, scientists, engineers, technologists and innovators across a wide range of sectors are busy investing heavily in research, ideas, planning, and crucially funds in a net-zero future. What's more, technology and data exist to allow smart solutions to be implemented and their impact assessed much more quickly than at any other time in our history."", 'This wave of innovation was the subject of a recent Futurice seminar, I hosted,  where  Claire Miller, Director of Tech and Innovation at Octopus EV, Carlton Cummins, Co-founder and CTO, Aceleron and Ben Lane, co-founder and CTO of Zap Map outlined game-changing developments in the mobility sector.', 'Rather than dwell on the roadblocks to transition, they delivered a solutions-oriented blueprint for how the industry can achieve zero-emission mobility. Here are five key gear shifts that give cause for optimism.', ""For the first time in the industrial age, there is a realistic alternative fuel for cars. Conversations about electric cars, hybrids, hydrogen fuel cells, mini-nuclear reactors, biofuels and more are all compelling examples of consumers questioning society's everyday addiction to fossil fuels. This new autonomy means people don't have to wait for their governments to act ‚Äì they can seize the initiative. By feeling more engaged with the carbon zero debate, they can exert direct pressure for change."", 'The companies that survive the transition away from fossil fuels will be the ones that introduce products and processes that enable consumers to follow their own road map towards a clean energy lifestyle. Rising competition in the European EV market suggests that this trajectory is already underway, with every new EV model seeming to crack a key obstacle to adoption. 2021 was another record-breaker for EV purchases, with the Tesla Model 3 becoming Europe‚Äôs best-selling car in September. Legacy manufacturers are responding in kind, with Ford planning to increase EV production capacity to 600,000 by 2023.', 'Read more on the electrification of mobility as a mega-trend\n', ""Consumers have been reluctant to buy EVs because they are not sure about the charging infrastructure. This issue won't be tackled overnight, but there is a clear understanding of what action is needed. Countries including Netherlands, France and Germany have made good progress ‚Äì while the UK and Australia are also increasing their investment."", 'One of the big opportunities will be the installation of charging points where cars are parked for significant periods of time, such as home driveways and recreational areas (sports and entertainment venues etc). This, combined with a shift towards shared charging models, will allow consumers to take advantage of new tariff structures and rewards. It‚Äôs a massive boost for the EV industry that all new build homes in the UK will have to have charging points from as early as 2022. While concerns remain about the UK‚Äôs  public charging infrastructure, Shell‚Äôs pledge to install 50,000 street EV charging points by 2025 should go some way to alleviating these.', 'Some drivers worry it will take ages to recharge their EV battery during holidays and business trips, even with charging points available. But there is also progress here, with batteries coming out in the next year set to charge up to 80% in 30 minutes. In addition, companies like Aceleron Energy are tackling issues around the longevity of batteries and their recycling and reuse.', 'Data will play a central role in helping consumers and businesses navigate the transition to carbon zero successfully. For example, data analytics can help overcome the real-time, dynamic complexity of transitioning by helping EV customers to navigate new challenges. These could include calculating what proportion of a domestic energy bill to charge to their employer because the company EV is charged at home.  Data will also play a key role in payments and routing, thanks to innovative companies such as Zap Map.', ""At the same time, data-powered insights are already supporting pivotal players in the race towards carbon zero, such as fleet managers ‚Äì who face the challenge of transitioning to electric fleets while in 5th gear. This shift involves moving towards a mixed fleet: managing multiple fuels and various kinds of vehicles, controlling emissions and dealing with supply shortages and regulatory changes. That's precisely the kind of challenge that the data analytics business can help solve."", 'One of the most exciting and positive aspects of the mobility sector is that companies of all shapes and sizes are willing to put their heads together to problem solve and overcome the barriers to net zero. This collaboration is partly because the market is expanding fast, with plenty of room for different players.', ""A great example of cooperation in the sector is the Open Charge Alliance, a consortium of public and private EV infrastructure leaders which promotes open standards. Open Standards play a significant role in enabling new and cooperative business models, allowing different technologies to talk to each other with the ultimate aim of providing consumers with a completely seamless experience. For example, ISO15118, which specifies the vehicle to grid communications interface for bidirectional charging/discharging of EVs, has the potential to enable a scenario where an EV driver plugs into a charger, and the driver is automatically charged for the amount they've used without having to do anything."", 'Design, communications and IT interoperability are areas where companies in the mobility value chain can cooperate to remove barriers and help drive EV take-up.', ""While financial institutions are typically cautious around carbon-neutral plays, Mark Carney's finance coalition, which has $130tn to spend on meeting 2050 net zero targets, is an important boost to the net-zero agenda in mobility and other frontline sectors. All told, 450 banks, insurers and asset managers are involved, a promising development for mobility sector pioneers."", ""Similarly, BP CEO Bernard Looney has also said investors are warming to his company's game-changing pivot to carbon zero fuels. Another positive sign of investor confidence in the sector is Amazon-backed Rivian's IPO this month, whose (arguably inflated) $100bn debut Nasdaq valuation overtook that of its stakeholder, Ford."", 'Tech innovation is key to accelerating EV adoption. But the mobility sector is also working hard to encourage a shift in mindset among its core consumers ‚Äì encouraging them to embrace the transition at an emotional level. This mindset shift is crucial since many consumers have yet to grasp their role in solving the climate crisis fully.', 'For those who value car ownership, salary sacrifice schemes like Octopus Energy‚Äôs Electric Dreams represent an imaginative way to motivate people to use EVs. Meanwhile, VW has helped address the high cost of purchasing a new EV with plans to lease second and third hand EVs, lowering a barrier of entry for first time EV consumers and allowing the manufacturer to keep hold of valuable batteries.', ""The good news is that Gen Z and millennials don't seem as obsessed with car ownership as previous generations. So there is a real opportunity for the mobility sector to lean into this generational shift and come up with new business models and solutions which balance consumer needs to get from A to B, quickly, conveniently and cheaply, and in a way that safeguards the planet for future generations.""]",[]

For patients and their relatives affected by severe and long-term health conditions like cancer, the value of a smooth experience is even greater. In this interview, Carina Roost tells her first-hand account of using the Futurice Connected Health Kit to improve the patient journey for people undergoing cancer treatment and those accompanying them.', 'The Connected Health Kit by Futurice is an innovative service design tool created to help the health sector adopt data-enabled digital services and solutions. It makes it easier to visualize and analyze workflows and processes in healthcare, and simplify them for the benefit of healthcare professionals as well as patients.', 'Introduced in 2021, the Connected Health Kit has already seen use in various real-life scenarios. One of these has been at Triemli Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland, where Carina Roost utilized the kit while working on her master‚Äôs thesis in digital management. In this interview, we talk with Carina about her experiences with the kit and what it is like to use from the perspective of a creative consultant.', '\nCarina Roost', 'I wrote my master‚Äôs thesis within the context of a case study at the medical oncology and hematology clinic at Triemli Hospital in Zurich. My main focus was on the many challenges presented by the increasing complexity of the healthcare system, the flood of information, and the integration of relatives into cancer patients‚Äô experience. This is also where I see promising future opportunities for service design as well as use of the Connected Health Kit.', 'In order to initiate a cultural shift that leads towards a more holistic approach, different stakeholders in healthcare ‚Äì like medical staff, patients and relatives ‚Äì need to interact more actively. And to enable the ideal and most appropriate flow of communication, we need better processes. The exchange of data and information between stakeholders needs to increase, and we have to understand the different parties‚Äô needs throughout the patient experience.', 'This is where my master‚Äôs thesis comes in. In it, I‚Äôve taken a human-centered design approach to make a case for the integration of the relatives of cancer patients, as well as for fostering the exchange of information with the medical staff.', 'The first step in improving a patient journey is to understand it ‚Äì holistically. The journey is highly individual for each cancer patient, and often cannot be generalized.', 'Nevertheless, it is crucial to understand the individual stations, experiences, and touchpoints that a patient and relative might experience over the course of a cancer diagnosis and treatment. For me, listening to the needs and wishes of the people involved is the basis for developing sustainable solutions that actually help those people and their needs.', 'As a tool, I used the Connected Health Kit to visualize the status quo of the existing processes in order to gain a holistic understanding of it. Visualizing the service blueprint helped me illustrate and comprehend the complexity of the journey from the patients‚Äô and their relatives‚Äô perspective, as well as the point of view of the hospital.', 'The service blueprint‚Äôs content was outlined based on insights from shadowing and interviewing the experts, and it constantly evolved throughout the research I did with the head physician of the medical oncology and hematology clinic. The blueprint captures all relevant touchpoints, services, communication tools and means, as well as the different actors and their connections, and it covers the essential elements of a cancer treatment journey.', '\nUsing the Connected Health Kit to create a service blueprint', 'Naturally, the service blueprint does not address all individual circumstances imaginable, and it is not a finished product. It requires constant revision and updating in order to reflect changes in the complex everyday life of a hospital.', 'Once it was put together, the clear and holistic visualization helped me identify gaps and new opportunities for the process of integrating relatives into the patient journey. The main learning for me was that lack of structure could be identified as the most crucial driving force and element. It leads to complexity, lack of resources and uncertainty, and additionally, it tends to overburden people and neglect individuality.', 'The Connected Health Kit is intuitive to use, it promotes discussion at different levels within an organization, and it has an appealing design.', 'Personally, I found that it helped me focus entirely on the content and present it in a clean, efficient, and understandable way. Anyone who has created a service blueprint or something similar knows how much time is needed to create a consistent and appealing end product. The Connected Health Kit provides an enormous boost in efficiency and it is also fun to use ‚Äì I‚Äôm a fan!', '', 'The Connected Health Kit is very versatile and can be adapted to the individual needs of each project.

This article might help the designers who are trying to improve but are uncertain what to do.\n', '\n\nMy supervisor once said, ‚Äúwhen you grow more senior, you have to choose projects where you feel you can grow.‚Äù It is a valuable quote to me. Like many other very kind designers, I don‚Äôt want to turn people down by saying ‚Äúno‚Äù. Thus, I have in the past accepted projects that I don‚Äôt feel particularly enthusiastic about. However, saying no is a very critical skill to have. Especially when someone asks you to build up some features instead of solving a problem, it is a sign that it might not be an enjoyable or impactful project to take on.', '\nIt is essential to understand and weigh the wishes of different stakeholders. When I was a junior designer, I only focused on completing my task. Now, I have learnt that building good relationships and understanding stakeholders‚Äô wishes are crucial. A project could fail if we forget to involve a key stakeholder at the beginning of the project.', '\nWhen I was a junior, I had confidence that I could create any design from my imagination. However, it didn‚Äôt always work out. Later a friend recommended me a book called Steal Like an Artist. I realized then how important it is to get inspiration before starting.', 'Before starting a design, think about what feelings you want to bring to your users. For some designs, ease-of-use and clarity are the essential experiences, e.g. finding a product as soon as possible from a website. For others, a sense of safety and certainty is the key, e.g. payment-related design. Thus, we have to rethink each experience to create a user-centred design.', '\nAlmost any object and service we experience are designed by someone. When using them, our emotions help us to build a better connection with our users. As humans, we all experience similar frustration or happiness. Thus, as a designer, we can translate our experiences and emotions into the actual design.', '\nAfter participating in many user tests, I figured that many users value content writing a lot. I used to think visuals is the most important for the users. Now I understand if I want to improve the user experience, I have to take care of the copywriting because it is one of the most crucial pieces for a user‚Äôs journey.', '', 'Accessibility is getting popular lately, partly because of regulation. It is not a mandatory skill for a designer to have, but understanding its basics is essential. For example, accessibility skills helped me to build empathy towards disabilities and the elderly. Also, with these skills, I can spot unreasonable designs before the implementation. Thus the developer doesn‚Äôt need to be concerned about the designs‚Äô accessibility during the implementation phase.', '\nBefore handing over a design, we need to think about all the possible scenarios. Otherwise, there might be endless discussions among developers and designers. The not well-prepared design will slow down teamwork and create a lot of worries for the developers. Also, it is crucial to understand what the developers‚Äô wishes and habits are. Some developers need all the design details, while others only want to have a few designs and enjoy interpreting the idea by themselves.', '\nAfter reviewing a design, some developers will propose design changes to make the code easier to manage. Most of the time, it is not a big deal. But sometimes, it is crucial to keep the original design because it has a massive impact on the user experience. It is not easy to understand at the beginning which one can be changed. When you grow more senior, you will find that there will be more evidence to back up your decision. Some examples of the evidence can be ‚ÄúIt is crucial information in this journey‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe have millions of users using this feature.‚Äù', '\nIt is not always easy to communicate the design in a way everyone would understand. Many designers have good hands-on skills but lack communication skills. For both stakeholders and designers, our shared goal is to solve users‚Äô problems. Realizing that is the key to communicate with your stakeholders.', '\nIt is vital to keep a positive attitude while working on a project.

But is it also the safest route? ,[],"['When cycling to a new place for the first time, you might have to find a new route‚Äîand the most common way is to look up the fastest one. But something that often falls out of the equation is safety since there isn‚Äôt that much information available about it. We at Futurice, therefore, started working on creating the safest bicycle routes.', 'Finding and evaluating data for cyclists is not always easy, since a lot of the data that is needed belongs to privately owned companies and different governmental organizations. But studying the data we actually have gotten hold of has made it easy to find routes that avoid high-risk areas, while simultaneously making the route fast. With this prototype, we‚Äôve not only made commuting by bike fast, we‚Äôve also made it safe.', 'At the moment, with the data we have acquired, we can currently determine the cycling routes in Stockholm with the most accidents. And this should be considered a big step in the right direction, as the information was nonexistent until recently. In some cases, it‚Äôs enough for the cyclists to think a second time before speeding their way to their destination. But in order to assure cyclists of when it‚Äôs safe to choose a certain route, we need additional information and data.', 'Our aim for the future would be to collect large amounts of quality data in order to run predictive models and let artificial intelligence (AI) identify locations where accidents are more prevalent. But if we are to do so, we need a lot more answers to our questions, something that is going to be a challenge. Machine learning and AI depend on large amounts of qualitative data. So if we are to create a product that aims to make cycling in the city safe, drivers, car manufacturers and other actors have to be generous enough to supply us with it.', 'We‚Äôve come a long way since we started our work with The Safe Route. We‚Äôve managed to get a hold of the coordinates to the most unsafe places in the city as well as establish an idea of what type of interchanges are the most recurring according to the data that STRADA (Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition) has shared with us. This means we‚Äôre able to provide information based on the number of accidents and the places they occurred. But we‚Äôre not able to provide a full answer to the question ""What is the safest route?"" since there are a lot of factors that have to be accounted for.', ""Safety is a spectrum that can be defined by risk, time, causes of previous accidents among many other things. Answering the question of how safe a certain place might be is therefore difficult without the proper data to back it up. But determining what places are safe or not is on the other hand pretty easy. For example, crossings and roundabouts are the most recurring interchanges in the reports we‚Äôve been able to analyze. Add the fact that the city center also has the highest density of accidents in Stockholm and you‚Äôre able to say that a crossing right next to T-Centralen simply isn't that safe."", 'But once we get a hold of data that tells us when accidents occur in certain neighborhoods, we will be able to give further intel as to when a route happens to be safe. Meaning, by adding more relevant data points from example electric scooters companies or building sites, the picture will get more nuanced. By having several data points, some areas might turn out to be more unsafe than what they are telling us from only one data set. Which in the end would provide for a better product.', 'In recent years we‚Äôve seen an increase in couriers across the city. A profession that relies on time efficiency. You need to get from A to B as quickly as possible and give less thought about dangers. Not that the couriers or the companies are to be blamed for this. It‚Äôs just that it has led to an increase in cyclists across Stockholm. However, data surrounding factors like these are of the utmost importance for us when creating The Safe Route.', 'A future where cyclists actually can make a decision based on safety is not that far away. But for that to happen, we need the city of Stockholm, corporations, and organizations to release more data. Currently, we are having conversations with different companies and organizations that might play a big role, but there‚Äôs still a lot that can be done.']",[]

What does the future in 50 years look like to you?']","['Our Managing Director Gian has been part of the Berlin office since the very beginning. Today, he proudly looks back on our evolution from a small group of developers to a growing diverse community and unique culture. In this interview, he reveals the most important lessons  he‚Äôs learned from some inevitable setbacks, shares his take on DE&I ‚Äì a topic very close to his heart ‚Äì and busts a whole bunch of myths about managers.', 'The focus of my studies was on diving deep into various technologies and methodologies. When I started working as a software developer later on, I gained experience in collaboration with diverse teams and clients. I learned how to drive projects and deal with the relevant stakeholders.', 'It has also helped me to acquire a very deep understanding of our business ‚Äì but I haven‚Äôt kept up with today‚Äôs technologies. Working as a software developer has rather taught me very valuable and handy soft skills that are still immensely relevant in my position today. Particularly my experience in project management has helped me find my way into leading people.', 'What I can say for sure is that an MD doesn‚Äôt have just business, numbers and money on their mind. To me, my role as MD is somewhat similar to that of a parent ‚Äì just like when your kid learns to take their first steps. Children need to experience things on their own and stumble every now and then in order to grow. As a parent, you want them to have their own experiences, and you‚Äôd only intervene when your help is needed.', 'That said, I believe in the philosophy of supportive leadership. For our business, this means putting trust in our people and empowering them to tackle new challenges, but without making anyone feel like being thrown into the deep end of the pool in the process.', '', 'Our culture is our most important pillar ‚Äì and that‚Äôs not just an empty phrase. I believe it‚Äôs good that we invest and develop a lot in this regard. And of course, it also helps us succeed in business. Our core values put the people front and center ‚Äì and it‚Äôs the people who make our community and culture what it is today.', 'In the beginning, we were a very homogeneous bunch of software developers and Finnish expats in Berlin. Today we are a much more diverse group of people, with different skills and backgrounds. That is very valuable. Of course, the Scandinavian mentality has had a very strong influence on us: we are all living in a very collegial, consensus-oriented and non-hierarchical culture. Today, all of our different locations have their own office-specific touch, which I think is great. Each individual contributes and shapes our culture and community.', 'The goal is to become one of the most renowned companies in our business in Europe. We want to grow ‚Äì not only quantitatively, but above all qualitatively. We want to work with clients that make an impact and we want to offer our people exciting and meaningful projects along with opportunities to grow and develop. Growth that happens just for the sake of growth cannot and will not happen. There must always be a healthy balance to preserve our culture.', ""We developed our 4x2 framework because we don't want to think one-dimensionally, but rather in all directions. This framework is meant to help us reach our goals while staying true to ourselves ‚Äì to reach not just a bigger impact, but a better one as well. Along this journey, we need to hold on to our core and level up to 4x2 thinking: people, clients, numbers, the world around us ‚Äì now and in the future."", 'At the beginning we were only a small group of mainly software developers in Berlin. In terms of business, a very important step for us was the expansion towards service design and consulting. We have started to support our customers end-to-end in more diverse and multidisciplinary teams, and already have three different locations in Germany.', 'A recent milestone was the introduction of a very modern and agile organizational structure ‚Äì more towards holacracy. A reorganization like that ‚Äì almost like open-heart surgery for Futurice ‚Äì should never be underestimated. But I am very confident that this can significantly increase the flexibility and opportunities we can offer our employees, and that we will master this challenge successfully.', 'There have been a few, but the most severe setback was the Covid crisis. We were living a very euphoric time at Futurice around the beginning of 2020 and suddenly the pandemic changed everything overnight ‚Äì causing many sleepless nights during what followed. No one knew exactly how the economy would develop and whether we might end up losing everything that had been built up before.', 'But we‚Äôve managed by drawing from what has been ‚Äì and still is ‚Äì the most important thing for us: the sense of togetherness. Especially in times like these, no one should be left behind. Instead, we‚Äôve gone through the crisis together. The greatest lesson I‚Äôve learned is that if you stick together as a team and community, you can survive even the biggest of storms.', ""To me, there are two sides to it. First, it has been proven that diverse teams achieve better results. Controversial discussions and perspectives simply produce better and more inclusive ideas. Second, I believe in the liberal and humane principle that everyone should have the same opportunities to grow. So it is also the company's job to break down potential barriers and set a fair course for everyone."", 'We have a working group that focuses on DE&I topics, but I am also convinced that this should be everyone‚Äôs concern. Each individual can really make Futurice a more inclusive environment. It‚Äôs particularly apparent in our language, communication and behavior ‚Äì everyone can and must contribute.', 'I think we have to understand that our resources on this planet are limited. So within the next 50 years, we must create a healthier, fairer and more peaceful Earth. We should use technology for the benefit of all, and work harder on issues that have a strong impact on our customers and the greater good. From the perspective of our three core themes, this means creating new ways of mobility, making our society and planet healthier, and influencing climate change in a positive way.', ""Interested in reading more stories about us and our people?

In machine learning (ML) without automation, data scientists explore different machine learning pipelines and, based on the results, choose the best performing pipelines (or keep on improving the models based on analysis). In AutoML a computer tests different machine learning pipelines and, based on the results, it keeps iterating to find the best possible one. So, in essence, AutoML automates the laborious work of finding the best possible pipeline (and all the necessary parameters).', 'AutoML has mainly been used for supervised learning applications, i.e., regression and classification, but it can also be used for unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. AutoML supports various data modalities such as structured data, text, images, sound, and temporal and multimodal data, and it can therefore be used in many different applications.', 'A user does not necessarily need to understand ML to use AutoML, meaning AutoML could potentially make anyone a citizen data scientist that can harness the power of machine learning to help them in their daily tasks. This could have a huge impact on how much machine learning is used to automate and support decision-making. Domain experts have the best knowledge and intuition about what they need to predict and what kind of data can be used to make such predictions to automate laborious tasks. Therefore, it is logical to let domain experts teach computers to help them to automate routine tasks without the need for a data scientist. This avoids the knowledge transfer gap ‚Äì and obviously removes the need to have a data scientist. Seeing the impact directly motivates domain experts to train computers, i.e., to provide carefully labelled data. It is critical because ML including AutoML needs high-quality training data.', 'In this post, we study how AutoML could be used in practical applications and discuss its limitations.', 'To get a good understanding of the current status of AutoML tools, a few experiments were carried out. Instead of running toy data examples such as MNIST or Boston house price predictions, which are being used in universities to teach the basics of machine learning, we wanted to test AutoML in a more realistic environment.', 'In Kaggle, thousands of human experts compete against each other in various tasks using data derived from real live systems. Therefore, Kaggle provides realistic datasets, and in addition, top-performing solutions can be considered state of the art.', 'Based on our experience, the three most common use cases for ML (for supervised learning) are structured data classification and regression, text classification and image classification. For this experiment we studied a couple of popular open-source libraries and cloud services for AutoML, then compared their performance to the top results in Kaggle competitions.', 'We chose to use text classification for our experiment because it is one of the most common and challenging problems in machine learning. Google‚Äôs JigSaw organised a Toxic Comments Classification Challenge in Kaggle three years ago. It was very popular and a challenging task, so we thought that it would be a good experiment for this study. In the challenge, the goal is to detect different types of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults and identity-based hate in Wikipedia‚Äôs edit page discussion comments.', 'AutoKeras', 'AutoKeras is a framework that searches for an optimal neural network architecture (and its hyperparameters) using neural architecture search (NAS) and Bayesian optimisation. AutoKeras is built on Keras and it uses Tensorflow as its backend to run computations. The benefit of having Tensorflow as the backend is that it is possible to use graphics processing units (GPUs) and even distribute computations to multiple GPUs.', 'AutoKeras supports structured data, text, images and multimodal data and it can be used for classification and regression of one or multiple outputs. Therefore, it can be used in many ML applications out of the box. It can also be extended rather easily for unsupervised learning applications.', 'AutoGluon', 'AutoGluon is built on Apache MXNet. AutoGluon supports stacking traditional scikit-learn pipelines together and also supports NAS. It can therefore efficiently find high-accuracy models for structured data and can also be used in more challenging cases such as text and image classification.', 'AutoKeras vs. AutoGluon ‚Äì a comparison', 'In the following table, we compare the features of AutoKeras and AutoGluon.', '', 'One of the biggest drawbacks of AutoGluon is that it does not support multi-label or multi-label classification, meaning multiple models need to be trained for a multi-label classification task.', 'AutoKeras\n', 'Embedded content: https://gist.github.com/teemukinnunen/d519813deccbd15e6e526cb1ecd5afc0.js</a>', 'AutoGluon\n', 'Embedded content: https://gist.github.com/teemukinnunen/acccf2e6d96559392b0dfdb3fefa329e.js</a>', 'As you can see, it is possible to train an AutoML model using AutoKeras with just a couple of lines of code. Since AutoGluon does not support multi-label classification, we had to implement a new class that consists of multiple AutoML text classification models (one for each label). It is not the most efficient way to do multi-label classification, because instead of training a single model, you need to train a single model for each label. Also, in inference, you need to run all the models once for each label.', 'All the major cloud vendors provide managed AutoML services. When using AutoML in a managed cloud service, you don‚Äôt need to worry about the infrastructure. It is enough to convert the training data into an appropriate format and upload it to the cloud service.', 'Amazon Web Services (AWS) bundled all their machine learning-related services into AWS Sagemaker. In AWS Sagemaker you can label data, explore data in hosted notebooks, and train models both with and without AutoML using Autopilot.', 'Microsoft provides a similar setup in their Azure ML workspace. Their AutoML solution is called Automated ML.', 'Google renewed its ML solutions recently. Now, all their machine learning tools are under the Vertex AI brand. Google Vertex AI also provides tools for data labelling, running hosted notebooks to explore data, and training and deploying custom ML and AutoML models.', 'On a high level and feature wise, all the cloud vendors have pretty much the same offering. For this study, we focused on Google AutoML.', 'Results of the experiment', 'In order to get a good understanding of AutoML, we carried out experiments using the Jigsaw Toxic Comments challenge in Kaggle. Naturally, the results of a single experiment cannot be generalised to other AutoML applications ‚Äì and only barely to other text classification tasks. However, they give a glimpse of what you can expect from open source and cloud vendor AutoML tools.', '', 'AutoGluon performs the worst in the experiment. The reason could be that it does not support multi-label classification out of the box, and we had to combine multiple binary classification models together. AutoKeras and Google Vertex AI AutoML perform virtually the same, with AutoKeras performing slightly better.', 'Running times and costs', 'Two important aspects in AutoML and the data science process are iteration speed and infrastructure costs. This is especially true if you want to deploy ML to a wider audience as cost and iteration speed could become bottlenecks.', '', 'It took ~5 hours to train a model using GCP Vertex AI AutoML and ~10 hours to train a model using AutoKeras (10 models, P100 GPU, 4 CPU cores, 16 GB ram). Training a model using GCP AutoML costs 15 USD, but making a prediction cost 750 USD: training models and running inference using AutoKeras and Notebooks in GCP cost a bit over 20 USD.', 'Development experience', 'It is easy to get started with cloud services if the data is already in a proper format. However, based on our experience, sometimes it is easier to use open source libraries than cloud services because their format for input data can be tricky in practice. For example, the CSV format is not suitable for text where a single document can contain multiple lines. JSON is more appropriate, but then converting from table format into nested JSONL is not trivial either, especially when the documentation is outdated and inaccurate.', 'AutoML can be used for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning; however, the most successful applications in AutoML use supervised learning where researchers and data scientists have achieved encouraging results. Because of this we recommend AutoML is used for supervised learning rather than unsupervised or reinforcement learning.', 'If the data is structured, it is most likely that a simple shallow model such as logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Random Forest will work just as well as more complex deep neural networks. In this case you should use shallow learning and find the best model using a standard model selection approach to save computational resources and time.', 'When using AutoML for unstructured data for a classification or regression task using supervised learning, lots of labelled training samples are needed or AutoML will not be able to train complex models. In such a case, you should use transfer learning or train a model for feature extraction using self-supervised learning, then finetune the model for the specific task with labelled data.', '', 'Limitations of AutoML', 'One limitation of AutoML is its slow iteration speed. In a typical data science project, a labeled training set evolves throughout the project. Training a model using AutoML takes hours or even days, which is not ideal for a quick, iterative process.', 'AutoML is reaching SOTA and even outperforms human experts in some domains, for example in image recognition when there is a large, labeled training set available and enough computational resources and time available. For smaller datasets and with a limited amount of time and resources available, it might be better to use human expertise and intuition to design neural network architectures. Not all AutoML libraries support transfer learning or the use of pre-trained transformers, which can be essential for working with small amounts of data.', 'The AutoML tools tested in this study are easy to use and robust enough to be used in real-world applications.', 'Cloud solutions make experimenting with AutoML easy because you don‚Äôt need to manage infrastructure or write code. However, cloud services don‚Äôt support all use cases and as they work more like black boxes, using them can become surprisingly expensive.', 'The open source AutoML tools tested here seem to perform at the same level if not better than the cloud solutions. They are more flexible and can therefore be used in virtually any use case. Of course, it would take more effort and maybe need the help of a data scientist. Also, when using open source tools, you need to manage the infrastructure to train the AutoML models and to make predictions. For a data scientist, that gives more freedom and flexibility, but for a citizen data scientist, it can be too challenging.']",[]

Digital services play an equally important part in creating truly inclusive mobility services and experiences.', 'This article is part of Finding the way forward, our publication focusing on new mobility in the age of data, platforms and ecosystems. Download the publication here, and learn more about our approach to the mobility industry here.', 'As a result of increasingly demanding user needs and expectations, the concept of mobility has evolved from individual products and technologies that cover a simple leg of a journey to ecosystem thinking that covers a whole set of journeys and use cases. In this context, accessibility plays a critical role. It is no longer about how a product could be inclusive for particular user groups, but is instead about how the services around it are an opportunity to improve the accessibility of the whole experience for everyone to the same level of quality.', 'Recall, for example, how a few decades ago making a printed map of bus stations accessible to visually impaired people was extremely difficult. Now a mobile app could easily accomplish this with screen readers and voice description.', 'The impact of this technological evolution goes beyond the simple fact that more users can now access your service; it allows for whole new use cases. Investments in accessibility and inclusivity have also spurred innovation. The work to develop screen readers for the visually impaired lead to digital assistants like Google‚Äôs Alexa and Apple‚Äôs Siri that benefit everyone. In this way, accessibility can have a large societal and business impact, leading to new opportunities.', 'Accessibility is often addressed in the context of a specific medium like a website or app. But today, mobility must be designed considering a system with multiple touchpoints, both digital and physical, and we need to analyse how different services can complement each other to improve accessibility.', 'Products are no longer independent of each other. They exist in the context of larger service ecosystems or networks, interlinked through integration, or as part of different steps of a multi-leg trip with different modes of transport. It is the task of the creators to think of these integrations, reducing complexity for end users and partners ‚Äì especially for the elderly and those of us who live with disabilities.', 'Planning the mobility experience with accessibility in mind is a great opportunity to make the service system more inclusive. However, this is a big challenge for the mobility industry, which must adopt new ways of creating inclusive ecosystems and move away from the idea of only analysing accessibility on a product-by-product basis. We need to consider accessibility starting from the first idea for a solution all the way through to its implementation.', 'Regulations like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 and EN 301 549 can give guidance but will not automatically result in great user experiences. Generally, it helps to adapt the POUR principle, which states that accessible technology should be Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust.', '', 'Making experiences on various screens and control devices perceivable can be tricky due to the diversity of interfaces that could be found in one service. Examples include:', 'These technologies must be understandable from the perspective of users‚Äô varying disabilities, like limited vision or hearing or motor disabilities. When displaying information you should take care to follow the two-sense rule. For example, with navigation the user might see an arrow on the screen as well as hear directions from a speaker.', 'Creating accessible solutions requires a combination of business, UX, UI and developer expertise, with constant prototyping and validation with test groups made up of people with different ages and abilities.', 'Sometimes the experience can be improved without additional user interaction, like how safety was improved with eye tracking by Lexus or self-balancing by Segway. Companies like Volkswagen, with their democratising mobility campaign, have already embraced this and many more are bound to follow. Biometric technologies like fingerprint, facial and voice recognition are also making user input more convenient and secure.', 'Accessibility is a driver for human-centred innovation, in mobility and other domains. Designing with accessibility in mind forces us to engage with and better understand our users. Accessibility practices make us think in new ways. It is therefore no surprise that improved accessibility often benefits all users ‚Äì including those without disabilities.', 'Every user benefits from clear, meaningful notifications. Here is a real-life example: John Blascovich is the president of The Matthew Foundation, a non-profit that seeks to improve the lives of people with Down syndrome. He writes in an article:', '‚ÄúCities could also use technology to make commuting safer and more predictable for people who have cognitive disabilities. Typically, these folks have memorised what bus to get on and how many stops to go, and if the route changes or the bus isn‚Äôt operating, they run into problems.‚Äù', 'When it comes to public transportation, users can be actively informed about delays and detours in real time and they should be advised how to handle route changes, such as by sending notifications to smartphones or wearables.', 'Mobility is a large part of our everyday life and needs to work seamlessly and effortlessly. The first-time use and the onboarding process need to be simple and easily understandable; a mobility product for the masses should not require the advanced technical skills of an early adopter but reduce barriers for setup. They should include easy personalisation and setup of assistive functions without visual noise so that people can get used to and adopt the service.', 'In a connected world, the same piece of information or required action can be presented to the user at various touchpoints. To create an understandable and predictable experience, consistency is key, otherwise users will be left confused and disoriented. Those with cognitive disabilities might even be unable to use the service at all. If data is being synced across multiple touchpoints, it needs to be clear to the user where the information is distributed and when it was last updated. This becomes especially challenging once a service is connected to third parties in a bigger ecosystem.', 'As designers we are often guilty of neglecting the importance of clear, simple UX copy in creating an accessible user experience. Rather than making it a core part of the design process from the start, we often delegate content planning and creation to a copywriter almost as an afterthought. Poor UX copy creates frustration and steepens the learning curve for users. The KISS principle is a good one to bear in mind ‚Äì keep it simple, stupid. Front-load your texts with important information, use simple language, avoid metaphors and abbreviations, and provide definitions for technical terms.', 'Besides avoiding legal issues and related costs, accessible design increases the potential customer base of a product. Disability statistics depend upon definitions used, but some studies estimate that 10‚Äì20% of the global population live with one or more disabilities. Among older populations the estimation ranges between 60‚Äì70% because most people acquire disabilities with age.', 'When an inclusive mobility experience has been designed properly, it avoids the additional cost of a specific accessibility audit, which is often required to meet current standards and regulations, and avoids the problem of using resources to fix preventable mistakes. Applying proper design thinking and accessibility best practices is essential.', 'Great accessibility in digital services can be a competitive advantage for your business. By making your services more available, usable and popular you can increase both your bottom line and the quality of life and happiness of your users.

https://futurice.com/blog/product-vs-project,Product vs project ‚Äì similar words but very different approaches,12 Dec 2021,Technology,What are the key differences between software as a product and project and which one to choose when?,"['What is SaaP - Software as a Product', 'Is your software initiative a project or a product?', 'A product', 'A project', 'Real-life project examples of software as a product and project', 'A note on uncertainty', 'What your choice of approach means for managing risk', 'Do you have to choose just one approach?', 'Final thoughts on software as product vs. a project']","['In the first blog post of this series, Chasing a vision, I talked about finding the right idea and communicating it. Now I‚Äôd like to share some thoughts on how to execute your chosen idea and whether you should approach software as a project or a product. \n', 'Long before software development was a thing, people were working on projects. From building a house to writing a book, a project is a broad term covering many processes where you start with a plan and then you execute it. Software development is a relatively new knowledge area so people borrowed methodologies that they were familiar with and adapted them using a term that everyone would understand: projects.', 'But one big problem with software and projects is that projects assume a lot of previous knowledge and understanding ‚Äì there‚Äôs the need for that plan that we mentioned. Writing software doesn‚Äôt tend to be like that, you don‚Äôt have the certainty of a plan when you start, instead you type the first line of code and you learn as you progress. From a rough idea you discover things over time, then iterate the software and shape what you‚Äôre working on into something that is good enough to be released for   users.', 'Recently people have taken this to mean that projects are therefore always wrong for software development and we should always be talking about products instead. But I feel this newly established wisdom is flawed ‚Äì while the vast majority of digital-first companies should embrace a more software product-based approach, projects are still the way to go in some situations. To know whether to approach software as a product or service, you should understand the benefits and limitations of each, so you can take the right approach to gain maximum value and avoid the kind of mistakes that can kill initiatives.', 'There are several key differences between product and project approaches.', 'could be software or a service, but it aims to meet a specific need and will require ongoing maintenance and upgrades. Product teams therefore stay together long term to ideate, build and run the product. Unlike projects, which are about the result, products are about the journey. There is no known end point and participants are learning as they go. With a product you never know when each lifecycle stage will end ‚Äì for example when you‚Äôll move from experimenting to growth. Even if everything seems predictable in the maturity phase, you don‚Äôt know when there‚Äôll be disruption. You can‚Äôt control the product lifecycle; all you can do is try to prepare for change.', 'on the other hand, is a way of executing an idea. In practical terms, with a project you need to understand a lot of things before you start: what time, money and people you have available, the expected quality and all the other constraints and drivers across the project execution. These all need to be outlined in the scope. A project is super focused on execution ‚Äì if you deliver late or over budget, it‚Äôs usually not a success even if your story tells otherwise. Projects are temporary with a defined beginning, one or more milestones and a fixed deadline. When the project is finished, the team members leave and begin a new project. Projects assume a predictable environment to start and be successful and planning is an essential part of the process.', '', 'One clear example to compare the difference between the two approaches would be the act of planning and writing a book (project) and that of maintaining a blog (product).', 'Software is complex and abstract, there are many solutions to the same problem and it‚Äôs hard to outline what you want to achieve. This means that a product approach is frequently the best way to execute software, but there are still plenty of exceptions.', 'Security is a case in point. For example, I was once working with a large team of people taking care of data leakage prevention. In this case the solution was to install a set of tools so we had a lot of certainty ‚Äì we knew exactly what was required, we had a deadline and a budget. It was totally predictable so managing it as a product would be completely wrong. It was a project and needed to be treated as such.', ""Hackathons are another good example of software as a project. Many software products are the result of a hackathon, but the hackathon itself is a project because it‚Äôs short term with fixed constraints and few learnings are allowed within the hackathons' timeframe."", 'One final example: any time you have a minimum viable product (MVP) you should be working on a project. When you release the first version of the MVP you can then decide to drop it or continue. But if you continue from MVP with a project approach, you will most likely not reach a           sustainable pace that is essential to create a good product ‚Äì a software project is a sprint, a software product is a marathon.', 'Organisations ‚Äì and people in general ‚Äì hate uncertainty, so they seek predictability. This can lead to endless planning and market research, rather than truly iterative and incremental practices like Agile. When we‚Äôre working on products we need to focus on the value we want to deliver and embrace the unknown by understanding that we know some things but there are many others that we are yet to discover.', 'Releasing ""good enough"" solutions to the problem at hand rather than spending time planning solutions to implement has been proven over the years to be the most successful approach to digital product development. This is essential because most modern software engineering practices only pay off in the long term, so the predictability that a project structure requires is often illusory in these timeframes.', 'Certainty plays a vital role when we need to evaluate if a project is feasible or not. Understanding our limitations ‚Äì be it the budget or time or something else ‚Äì to create as much certainty as we can for the situation will allow us to decide if it still makes sense to continue with the plan.', 'While projects focus on the outcome and the fixed constraints (cost, time, resources) available to achieve them, products need to focus on crafting a sustainable environment that allows the development of a high-quality outcome regardless of what it is. The sustainable environment is what allows the team developing a product to learn and evolve instead of just following an unrealistic plan.', 'The level of uncertainty embraced ultimately affects the relationship with risk and this is a major difference between products and projects.', 'When executing a project, risk is part of project management. For every risk, a decision needs to be made as to whether you accept it or mitigate it. This is possible because within a project you have your constraints and landscape mapped out for you. Risk is a constant for projects ‚Äì you have the same risks throughout the project timeline, although in a good project the risk will decrease as you get closer to project delivery. Project execution is all about managing risk with the assumption that if you can control all risks everything will go smoothly.', 'With a product you have to embrace risk, be aware of your surroundings and make decisions on the go, with everyone in the team accountable for different risks depending on their role. Risk changes a lot throughout the product process and you have to be ready to pivot on the fly. In a product the risk is constantly high because your product is affected by external factors that you have no control over. For example, when a new competitor releases a better, cheaper product.', 'To combine project and product approaches you need to be aware of the differences between them and choose carefully when to go from one to another. Most big tech companies maintain software products, but sometimes a project is needed. Perhaps a competitor has created something interesting and your company wants to see if it would work for you. This would require a software project: a burst of effort, delivery, and then see if it‚Äôs something to pursue. Another time a product-focused company would pursue a project is to mitigate risks: maybe some new legislation is introduced and you need to purchase software to continue to operate. A software project can address these needs and solve the problem alongside the product approach.', 'That said, I disagree with people who say that a product lifecycle is lots of small projects. This can be very harmful because if people aren‚Äôt allowed to pull their heads out and see the big picture the long-term perspective can be lost and there is no product innovation or evolution. In a project you need to reach your goal no matter what. While this is good for your project, it‚Äôs harmful for your product and people over time.', 'In a product approach you need to have the freedom and autonomy to take pauses; the team is accountable and they should be trusted to take breaks. When you have one project after another you‚Äôll soon see stress, burnout and high employee turnover, all of which are barriers to innovation. While everyone can work at 100% for two weeks to meet a project deadline, for a product everyone should work at a more sustainable pace, say 80%. Then if there‚Äôs a product lifecycle change you can work a 150% burst to pass the critical phase and then return to a sustainable 80% level.', 'As you can see, it‚Äôs not a matter of product being better than project ‚Äì they are wholly different approaches ‚Äì like a hammer and a drill, two different tools for two different jobs. The benefits of both approaches can be leveraged but you need to be aware of the pitfalls of each and when to switch from one to the other. For most software development cases, a product approach will be the right one, but a project approach can be invaluable if deployed at the right time and conducted in an excellent manner. By considering the difference between the two you can continuously make the right choice to extract maximum value from all your software initiatives.']",[]

When used in combination with existing choices like public transportation, taxis, bicycles and walking, it offers a seemingly emission-free and fast way of completing daily journeys.', 'Micromobility covers various types of small vehicles intended for personal use over relatively short distances and particularly in cities, ranging from regular bicycles and scooters to their electric counterparts and beyond. The phenomenon itself is not particularly new, but the term has\xa0recently spiked in popularity with the emergence of e-scooters and -bikes, as well as a variety of new rental and sharing services built around these vehicles.', 'The use of shared modes of mobility was already skyrocketing before the Covid-19 pandemic. While the development has temporarily slowed down, shared mobility is projected to represent 16% of all global travel by 2040, clocking in at an impressive 4,250 billion kilometres. That‚Äôs over 100 million laps around the world.', 'These new modes of transportation continue to grow because they are convenient, easy to use, and fun. And they are what people want. By working together with the users to understand their needs and wants, micromobility companies have scaled up at an unprecedented pace, introducing their services to new cities and countries in record time.', 'Due to the complicated nature of massive transportation systems, all involved parties must collaborate to create the change we need: the private and public sectors; the regulators and the citizens; the end-users and service providers. All must work together for a common goal.', 'Cities ‚Äì and travelling within or between them ‚Äì have evolved over hundreds and thousands of years. Changing the way we move means changing the cities themselves, and this will take time.', 'Ubercab, as they were originally called, launched their first commercially available service only 10 years ago. Since then, UBER‚Äôs disruption tactics have led them to become one of the most hailed, and many times most hated, new mobility service providers. The company was valued at over 80 billion USD at the time of their IPO in the spring of 2019 but crashed to half of that in 2020 (and has since recovered).', 'After the early days, Uber has become much more collaborative, working with cities and regulators, and even at times partnering with former competitors to be able to exist in certain markets.', 'In Europe, cities and governments aim to provide citizens with transportation options that help make cities livable and thriving, both now and in the future. Choices used to be limited to public transportation (busses, trams, trains) and private cars, but since the advent of Uber and the emergence of other new modes of transportation, transport officials have had to start discussing, planning and collaborating with a variety of new service providers entering their streets.', 'As they have matured, the new service providers have also realised that they need the city as a whole to function in order to provide a good service for their users. The early days of Lime e-scooters littering the streets and sidewalks of San Francisco did not work, and the end customers ‚Äì the people living in the cities ‚Äì were not better off. But the early success proved that people wanted more and quickly adopted new modes of transportation.', 'For mobility services to thrive in the long term, the parties involved must set new rules for a new era of mobility.

Due to the massive size of the ecosystem and the complexities involved, it‚Äôs clear that nobody can just follow their own agenda or protect their positions. Collaboration is the only way forward.', 'For many organisations, this calls for new and unusual ways of conducting their business.

It needs to provide all stakeholders with a win-win-win proposition, and the sum total needs to be positive ‚Äì greater than its parts on their own.', 'Ecosystems are based on trust, not lock-in agreements and terms, and end-users must have easy access to their service of choice. Technical compatibility as well as clear rules for managing and sharing data are a must, and fighting for customer ownership will undermine the ecosystem. The collaboration between established mobility services and new mobility solutions is inevitable, but also a massive undertaking.', 'At the end of the day, the success of new modes of mobility, or new mobility ecosystems, depends on the end-users. If they don‚Äôt like what they see, they can easily get back in their cars or choose other means of moving around.', 'Understanding the customer is where service creation and ecosystem building should start.', '\nDesigned with resources by Freepik.', 'When the automobile was launched, Henry Ford used the promise of free and open highways for everyone as the ultimate prize for buying and owning a car. That promise still echoes in all automobile advertisements. But the reality of the ensuing congestion and pollution, and the ineffectiveness of that paradigm in today‚Äôs world, has led to a need for new solutions.', 'Freedom of mobility ‚Äì travelling when you want to and where you want to ‚Äì is still what people look for in mobility solutions. Reaching that freedom now needs to take new forms in the face of the massive number of people travelling in cities, and beyond, every day.', 'When asked directly, people will have a hard time expressing their wishes for new mobility solutions. Had Mr. Ford asked people what they want, the answer could indeed have been faster horses. But, when exposed to actually using ‚Äì or at least imagining using ‚Äì new solutions in their daily lives, potential issues are quickly spotted and promptly solved. This is one of the cornerstones of user-centric service creation, employed by our Lean Service Creation methodology.', ""For example, when people are asked how many trips they take per day, how many kilometres they travel during these trips, or even how long they travel ‚Äì they don't really know. Travel patterns are automatic and deeply ingrained. That is actually an advantage when designing new mobility solutions, since it turns out people mostly don‚Äôt change their habits."", 'In Finland, people take around 3 journeys per day, for a total of around 40 kilometres per day, and this has remained the same for a long time. In London, for example, the number of trips per person stays similar, but the time spent stuck in traffic may be different. When journeys require new multimodal solutions ‚Äì i.e. combining one option with another ‚Äì things get more complicated, and users need to be nudged towards making an effort and changing their habits. There is slow but certain change towards more sustainable choices, as the 2020 Travel in London report suggests.', 'One part is understanding the needs of the users (e.g. travelling from point A to B) and the potential obstacles users feel they might face if they change their travel habits.

The benefits of choosing new ways need to be clearly communicated while giving the users what they need: freedom, comfort, predictability and control over their movement.', 'There is no stopping the future. The way we travel is going through more radical changes now than it has over the past 100 years.

How will we buy commodities and from where?","['Creating the vision', 'Behind the scenes', 'Services for every sense', 'Embrace the possibilities']","['What will we eat, drink, and consume in the future? How will we buy commodities and from where? Together with 100 Futuriceans, 7 groundbreaking companies and 1 university, we decided to find out. In our recent webinar, we deep dived into the vision work and learnt our collaborators‚Äô views on the future.', 'Together with our professionals and Finnish companies Kesko, Valio, Olvi and Berner, as well as Aalto University, we crowdsourced a vision of retail in 2030.  To create the content, we used our Lean Futures Creation Toolkit, a comprehensive set of tools and templates that guided the participants in understanding how things can change and what opportunities different futures can bring. We chose the most central ideas and PESTLE-analyzed them. Next, we formulated key topics and put them in a futures chart and created different future scenarios based on the alternatives. The four scenarios included creating live shopping experiences with influencers, developing optimized groceries-as-a-service systems, managing the politically torn consumer base, and restructuring services through digital twins.', 'For each scenario, we storified the lives of future consumers in 2030: a social media influencer using augmented reality to point customers to his portfolio products in the local shops, a breast cancer survivor giving sensitive data to get goods delivered to her home, a senior nurse working remotely and letting the system make the ethical decisions for her, and a doctoral student building a digital twin of a shopping mall in a suspicious world where paying is based on face-recognition. The main trends related to each scenario are also mentioned in the stories.', 'Based on these scenarios, we identified the most significant future trends, described in detail in the future of retail vision.', 'The moment you have a story about the future, it can be visualized, and then you start looking at ideas as if they were actual services. This speeds up thought processes and accelerates innovation. ‚Äì Mia Muurim√§ki, Design Director at Futurice.', 'The key retail innovations behind the scenarios, or ‚Äúprovotypes‚Äù as we like to call them, were:', 'For each innovation, there is also a tension. For example, to get personalized services and portfolios, customers first need to provide retailers with their personal data, and people can get suspicious on how their information is used. At its core, digital marketing in the 2030s depends on people who trust you, support your cause, and connect with you. These are also the people that buy from you on social media.', 'Also, although the climate change is going rapidly forward, people still get nostalgic and attached to what they‚Äôve used to consume‚Äìat the same time, they want to make a positive impact. Thus, we need more openness from retailers. For example, the retail ecosystems are strongly interconnected for example with water-intensive sectors that have a major impact on water pollution.', 'Since products have a huge number of given environmental attributes, they should be easily available to the consumer, so they can make their choice. ‚ÄìMaria Nylander, Communications and Sustainability Manager at Berner.', 'The triumph of hyper personalization continues towards 2030; what we eat and consume is data-inspired and tailored to match our unique bodies and minds‚Äìshopping has become the statement of self. The main factor in retail is digitalization, harnessed to make consumers‚Äô lives easier.', 'We all, as consumers, want retail as a service. ‚Äì Tuomas Sointu, Business Development Director at Kesko Trade', 'Therefore, all businesses, including retail, will transform into data business and products into personalized services.', 'For example, when you are buying a car, are you buying a product or movement? ‚Äì Lasse Mitronen, Senior Fellow at Aalto University', 'Also, a better standard of living affects consumers‚Äô behavior and expectations.', 'We believe that the standard of living will continue to grow. This means the consumers will be both more demanding and willing to pay more. For example, home deliveries increase also because less and less people will have a driver‚Äôs license, and all kinds of out-home-consumption will grow. ‚Äì Olli Heikkil√§, Marketing Director at Olvi', 'Retail brands in the 2030s are experienced in every sense, fluently through digital and physical channels. Ordering goods from the internet is more popular than today, but physical stores still exist and are important for customers‚Äìthey are centers of experience and socializing. Stores are used as centers of information and entertainment where customers utilize technologies, such as AR. Also, rapidly growing groups of single households and elder people are taken into consideration. When it comes to generation Z, those currently 15‚Äì25 years old, ethics and ecological views have become more important than ever.', 'The future of retail is new technologies and data-driven personalization.', 'Consumers are not anymore only at the end of a linear value chain as recipients, and the retail companies need to ask themselves how they create partnerships that allow hyper personalization and make the customer journey as convenient as possible. ‚Äì Tuƒüberk Duman, Head of Innovation at Futurice.', 'From the downloadable retail vision, you¬¥ll get a detailed and practical view on all these subjects and more.

Since last summer, every Futuricean has had the opportunity to freely decide where to work, which I am very happy about. Let‚Äôs take a look at how remote work at Futurice actually works.', 'Times change and we‚Äôve all adapted ‚Äì during the pandemic, even organizations that weren‚Äôt used to remote work just had to. But getting used to something doesn‚Äôt mean it works. Every new situation takes its time, and the new normal is no exception. At Futurice, our starting point for making the rapid and unexpected shift to remote was about as good as it gets, having used remote meetings, digital communication channels and other related technologies for years. I believe our familiarity with this way of working was important for those of our clients the situation was new for.', 'Currently, I choose to work 100%. I am a family man with kids, and remote work makes organizing my life easier. It now seems unbelievable, but I used to drive more than 100 km to work and back every day. Take that away and I have a lot more time and energy for actual work and can better serve our clients. At home, I have no distractions and I can close channels to concentrate on complex tasks when I have to. Remote work is more sustainable, too, so it‚Äôs a win-win-win situation.', 'Remote meetings and digitized communications have become routine for all organizations. People have realized that we can actually work this way and understand its benefits. And organizations want to support it now.', 'I think I will keep working from home until my kids grow up unless I become interested in a career position that requires a physical presence.', 'Earlier this year, I returned to Futurice from a position elsewhere. I worked remotely some of the time at my previous employer, too, but immediately remembered how good things are around here. I get to work as a part of an agile and multidisciplinary team, use the best practices and technologies and, on top of that, stay connected to clients and each other on daily basis. We use different channels for weekly meetings, fast chats for quick questions, and systems for project management. We start every day with a morning meeting of the development team, during which we check out the current situation and workloads, and discuss a lot of technical stuff. There is always room for talk on any topic. It‚Äôs the details that help remote work flow ‚Äì not just for us, but for clients, too.', 'As employees, we‚Äôre given a lot of responsibility, and we get to manage our own calendars very freely. It‚Äôs great and allows me to be independent and social at the same time. Without Futurice‚Äôs culture of trust and openness, none of this would be possible.', 'The fact that no one here is left alone gives me a warm feeling. We carry a strong sense of belonging and have a close support network ‚Äì in addition to a secure, regular income, these are the only things that make the difference for me between a position at a company and work as a freelancer. Along this support system comes the chance to ask for professional coaching advice and peer support to adjust your career trajectory. Futurice has a lot of versatile projects and career paths to choose from. For a freelancer, achieving the same would be a lot harder.', 'In my opinion, the key to success in remote work, in addition to a culture that genuinely supports it, is remembering three things:', 'For example, I dress at home just as I would for the office and try to keep my working hours from 8am to 4pm. I am also a social person, so I visit the office regularly. Face-to-face discussions help keep me up-to-date and suit my need for real human contact.', 'The possibilities for success are now better than ever.

But we wanted to get a handle on where we are in the cycle from high-level talk to scalable action.', 'Sustainability action is industry-specific to some extent, so to go deeper we chose to focus on one industry ‚Äì in this case, the energy industry, as it‚Äôs so central to the sustainability discussion. Based on a couple of trend articles like this one, we selected the following sustainability action areas: wind, solar, distributed production, energy storage, geothermal, hydrogen, biodiesel, carbon capture, virtual power plants and social sustainability. Not the perfect selection, but good enough to test the insights that data can provide.', 'We then picked seven of the biggest pan-European energy companies, with workforces ranging from 20,000 to 165,000, and analysed their social media posts for these themes, as well as their synonyms. We anonymised the companies as this study was about observing industry trends and not pointing the finger at any individual company in case our findings get dicey (spoiler alert ‚Äì they will).', 'Out of 1750 total social media posts, guess how much these action areas are being discussed?', '', 'It‚Äôs no surprise to see that wind and solar show up a lot ‚Äì in 23% of the posts analysed.

If we take out just two of the companies, the ones labeled Company D and F, our action areas are basically non-existent in this data, outside of wind and solar. Granted, social media is only one part of the picture, but if these companies were taking action, wouldn‚Äôt you expect them to be shouting about it more?', 'As with the previous analysis, there are plenty of interesting weak signals to follow too. For example:', 'Who we hire often indicates where we‚Äôre investing in action. So let‚Äôs see how our sustainability action areas show up in open job postings we found from the same companies.

This enables us to see how these themes are reflected in the actual role descriptions of these open positions.', '', 'Again, solar and wind come out on top, as expected. But beyond that, we see even less activity than in the social media posts ‚Äì with just 5% of the job postings relating to any of our action areas.', 'Let‚Äôs look at the company breakdown:', '', 'Most are hiring around wind and solar. But if we remove Company F, only 1% of the open job postings relate to any of our other action areas.', 'We‚Äôve still only looked at two data points, so the findings need to be taken with a pinch of salt. But is high-level sustainability talk leading to real action in the energy industry? If we take out wind and solar, this data indicates there‚Äôs little concrete talk and even less action.', 'We‚Äôve also uncovered some more weak signals to explore:', 'We‚Äôre making decent progress and further validating our hypothesis ‚Äì that analysing digital footprint data can give us unique visibility into our clients and markets.', ""Next, we‚Äôll analyse the companies' sustainability efforts from a different perspective, by focusing on patent data and figuring out what clues that might give us on their approach.

They‚Äôve also started to explore machine-learning applications that help them solve complex problems that can be answered through insights gained from large volumes of data.', 'They‚Äôve started to understand and identify what valuable data that they possess. They‚Äôre collecting it, analyzing it and using it to improve their business and operations.', 'The two most obvious ways for companies to commercialize data are:', 'We help companies understand the commercial opportunities digital data provides and believe that these two ways are necessary, but just not enough. Companies must go beyond the obvious and apply creative thinking to their data commercialization efforts. They typically master the structured engineering-like process of data collection and analysis, but fail in the innovative and commercial side of things. They fail to make use of and commercialize all the data they have.', 'We want to inject fresh, new thinking into data commercialization and provide perspectives that companies tend to neglect. Following are six inspirational ways for companies to make money with their data, with real-life cases to illustrate how they work in practice.', 'Taking existing data, aggregating and enriching, and then selling it to customers as new valuable insights makes sense. Reports, online dashboards and indexes can be standalone products bundled with the company‚Äôs existing offering, helping increase the price of the bundle that is sold to customers. User interfaces can be augmented with machine learning applications to help customers get what they need or interact with the brand. New insights are created ‚Äúon-the-go‚Äù, as a part of the customer encounter.', 'An example: Oikotie.fi, a leading player in job portal business in Finland, has created a smart way to commercialize its data. Oikotie.fi created a payable product for its B2B customers: after paying a fee, recruiters can see how their job ads perform against the rest of the (anonymized) players of their industry. This data helps the B2B customers improve their recruitment advertising and provides the job board with new revenues.', '(For the sake of full transparency, the writer of this blog used to work for Oikotie.fi earlier in his career)', 'A sales organization‚Äôs role in a company is to maximize sales. Data can be a highly effective tool in reaching that target. Smart companies empower their sales force with rich customer data sets that help them easily identify customer problems, potentially churning customers and sales leads. With data, the sales force can give better product presentations, improve customer service and use more tailored sales argumentation when meeting customers. Smart companies position themselves as outstanding data leaders, and sales people play an important role in delivering that message to customers.', 'An example: The Finnish elevator and escalator company Kone is a good example of a firm that has given its sales force access to valuable data. When a sales rep meets a customer who has a Kone elevator or escalator installed, he/she is well informed on the condition of the device, including any potential problems, and can help the customer extract the most value out of the device. Often this leads to additional maintenance services and/or spare parts sales.', 'Data that tells us something about consumers and their interests can be used to create marketing and advertising solutions. You have two options: either the company uses its data to optimize its own marketing and advertising or sells its data to other companies, so they can do it.', 'An example: The search-and-discovery service app Foursquare sells its data to retailers so they can optimize their outdoor advertising and online marketing to match the routes people use to navigate the city. Media companies collect digital data on people‚Äôs interests - e.g. sports, food, clothes, etc. - and sell it to online advertisers. Weather forecasting companies like Foreca can help clothing retailers optimize their advertising to match the weather conditions (e.g. sales of umbrellas, swimsuits and winter jackets). eCommerce companies like Zalando collect data on unfinished shopping carts in their services and target their own online advertising at the Facebook feeds and other channels of those potential buyers.', 'Companies often view their business as a ‚Äúsilo‚Äù and the data they have, they‚Äôve derived from their own operations and own customer interactions. They use it for their own purposes only. The reality is that they‚Äôve been operating in network environments and value chains where the final customer delivery is the result of the joint effort of several collaborative companies. In recent years many companies have woken up to the fact that these networked business environments create opportunities for sharing and capitalizing data from company to company. Data can be an important asset in optimizing the operations and cooperation of the players in the value chain. Companies can monetize their data by selling it to their suppliers and vendors down the value chain or by selling it to retailers, resellers and other sales-related partners up the value chain ‚Äì or both.', 'An example: The provision of data from one player to another is typical in pharmaceutical value chains. Finnish pharmaceuticals distributor Tamro sells data on drug purchases by the Finnish people to local pharmacies, who can compare their own sales against their competitors and optimize their drug display and stock in stores. Tamro also sells data to drug manufacturers like GSK and Novartis, who then use the sales data to set prices for their products. Tamro very cleverly capitalizes its data both up (pharmacies) and down (drug manufacturers) the pharmaceuticals value chain.', 'A not-so-obvious opportunity to monetize data is to look outside the company‚Äôs industry or value chain. There might be a number of players interested in insights on economic activity, consumer behavior or other relevant topics. These players might be found in surprising fields. Companies should actively seek out these players and explore innovative joint opportunities.', 'An example: Due to a legislative changes in the EU, retail banks like Nordea and Danske Bank are required to open their accounts and payments data for use by others. This opens up lucrative, new business opportunities for fintech, information services, telecoms firms and others with the capabilities to create new digital services based on consumer banking data. Another potential example comes from the sportswear industry: companies like Nike have started to collect data generated by smart sports clothes. In the future they may start to offer that data to insurance companies, who can use the data to predict a customer‚Äôs health insurance needs. A third example: export and import volumes of goods in harbors are a good early indicator of economic activity in a given country, so some harbor operators have started to sell that data to players who wish to forecast economic fluctuations, such as banks and financial institutions.', 'The ultimate way to make money with data is to consider data as an asset in the company¬¥s balance sheet and sell the entire company to a buyer who desperately needs the data. In this case, the data is considered valuable, because it can help the buyer to grow or improve its business. The data is sold as a full package, as part of the rest of the company assets.', 'An example: Would Facebook have paid $22 billion for the shares in WhatsApp in 2014 if the M&A target didn¬¥t have data on 600 million consumers worldwide? Probably not. WhatsApp‚Äôs revenues were very low at the time of the deal - only $10 million in 2013. The reason Microsoft paid $2,5 billion for Minecraft in 2014 had little to do with the actual revenues of the acquisition ($330 million in 2013). It was the data. A key element in the very high valuation of these acquired companies was the consumer data they possessed.', '---', 'Making money with data is a gigantic, worldwide business opportunity and many smart companies are already moving ahead with their data commercialization plans. Partnerships with players in and outside industries are instigated with the aim of combining data from different sources to enrich it into valuable, new insights. Functions within companies, such as sales, marketing and product development, are benefiting from rich data and able to create new revenues. Some companies even approach their customers directly to offer data as a new packaged product - something that generates revenues immediately.', 'In the hands of skilled experts, data combined with the high processing power of computers enables the creation of machine learning applications with the potential of revolutionizing entire industries. These technologies will help companies move from the reporting of past events towards monitoring real-time events and, eventually, towards predicting what is likely to happen in the future. Given the recent advances in machine learning and the six innovative ways of making money with data mentioned above, I believe we¬¥re about to witness a real proliferation of companies whose business is heavily reliant on data exploitation.', 'There are legal issues related to data commercialization and consumers‚Äô privacy concerns must be taken seriously. Governmental players like the EU are actively and constantly shaping the way data should/can be made available and how it‚Äôs stored, so companies should stay on top of legislative changes, now and in the future. Whenever the law allows data analysis, disclosure, transfer and sales, there‚Äôs plenty of room for innovative thinking, technology exploration and new business creation.', 'Mastering machine learning and data commercialization is serious business and requires management‚Äôs full attention. Any company not doing its best at it is most likely leaving loads of money on the table.', 'Mika Ruokonen is an expert in AI driven business transformation at Futurice. His 15+ years‚Äô experience in digital technologies and software solutions have included various roles such as P&L responsibility, business development, research, sales, and consulting.

As soon as you've got a good requirement and a sustainable cadence, it's just a matter of translating those requirements into lines of code."", 'Of course this is an oversimplification ‚Äì especially in the context of tech-centric businesses where all the knowledge areas (such as business, design, tech and marketing) are all mixed up into interdisciplinary business units ‚Äì but humour me on this one.', ""Assuming that we know how to write good software and release it to our end users, the real issues actually exist before the first line of code is written. These problems usually grow over time and penetrate software engineering processes, generating some of the pain points that are often discussed as being ‚Äòcontemporary software engineering issues‚Äô when, in my humble opinion, they're business issues."", ""When I say the actual issues exist even before the first line of code is written, I'm referring to lack of alignment between everyone involved in the vision that they want to achieve."", ""It's not hard to understand the reasoning behind it since software engineering ‚Äì like most digital products and services ‚Äì is a complex and abstract area. Complexity in this case means that there are multiple correct solutions to the same problem, and abstract means that there's a lot of room for ambiguity when it comes to describing expectations."", ""Intuitively we can understand that it's simpler to communicate our vision when things are concrete, because you've got more tools to describe the expected output and therefore you rely less on other people‚Äôs interpretation. The fancy name for this is ‚Äòa low representational gap‚Äô."", ""For example, if I want to build a car, I can create a super-detailed 3D model to describe how each physical component should work. Try to do that with a web page and you'll soon realize that it's harder than you think. The same applies to problems that only have a few possible solutions. It's easier to create alignment when there is only one possible path forward."", ""The actual output of software usually depends on other people's interpretations of a description of complex and abstract expectations. That alone can help you imagine how challenging our problem is."", ""Now, I'm not advocating for extensive documentation ‚Äì been there, done that, and it will most likely fail. Plus, the fact you'll spend tons of time producing it and the problem still won't become less complex or less abstract."", 'The good news is that the solution to these problems is simple ‚Äì but unfortunately it‚Äôs not easy. The solution is that people need to talk to each other.', 'Plain, simple conversations have been proven to be the best tool to create alignment over an abstract vision, helping to empower people so they can work autonomously to solve complex problems.', ""And as creating alignment over an abstract vision is the topic I want to cover in this article, let's jump into an overview of the processes and tools I've seen in use over the years."", 'In my experience, creating alignment is carried out either sequentially or iteratively. The main difference between these two approaches is not so much the order of things or how much time you spend on them, but rather how comfortable the team or organisation is with working in unpredictable environments.', ""The sequential approach relies on the assumption that dedicating time before jumping into building a new product or service will make the overall process quicker because you'll be able to fail faster before bootstrapping a new team or initiative which requires upfront investment. The premise is that you will ‚Äòwaste less‚Äô carrying out activities like market research and prototyping before moving into active development. This is ultimately the idea of pursuing as much certainty as possible to ensure only relevant experiments are tested. The best-known example of this approach is the waterfall model of software development, but activities such as exhaustive market research before developing a new product are also examples of a linear, ‚Äòwaterfall‚Äô approach."", 'Iterative approaches rely on the assumption that team dynamics play a strong role in product success. Therefore, allowing a team to work together as early as possible will allow them to fail and learn. This helps the team to develop a strong dynamic which maximises product success because when relevant opportunities present themselves, the team is mature enough to seize them. Design Sprint, Lean Inception and Lean Service Creation are examples of iterative approaches.', 'It might be appealing to choose one of the approaches and just leverage its benefits, but I truly believe that the greatest value is achieved when we understand and leverage the best of both approaches. This is what most successful digital organisations have been doing for a while: they run both approaches in parallel, creating an uninterrupted workflow based on continuous discovery. They rely on research and on stopping irrelevant experiments, creating delivery teams that understand their job is also to challenge assumptions and pursue facts. This leads to teams that are always experimenting and testing hypotheses rather than accepting any assumption as a fact.', 'In summary, these organisations adopt a research-oriented approach to reduce the number of experiments they need to carry out and then transition to iterative ways of working when developing an actual product. Regardless of the research carried out, successful organisations embrace the unpredictability that is a natural characteristic of digital products ‚Äì especially consumer-facing ones.', ""The importance of eliminating irrelevant hypotheses is intuitive because it's tied to the elimination of waste, and this is the main benefit that a sequential approach brings. On the other hand, the iterative approach contributes to the development of two fundamental capabilities: resilience and agility."", 'Resilience and agility make teams good at pivoting and fearless when facing new challenges or opportunities. This ultimately leads to teams that are capable of maintaining and updating a product vision over time.', 'By building a vision that relies on both sequential and iterative development approaches we reduce the likelihood of wasting time and money, and also create innovative teams that develop products based on continuous learning and discovery.']",[]

But major trends within the automotive industry mean changes are on the way.', 'This article is part of Finding the way forward, our publication focusing on new mobility in the age of data, platforms and ecosystems. Download the publication here, and learn more about our approach to the mobility industry here.', 'As autonomous driving technologies, electrification and improvements in hardware drive down the frequency of servicing and repairs as well as the majority of other aftermarket activities, each individual service interaction becomes a more important opportunity than ever. Can data ‚Äì and a holistic view of the entire aftersales process ‚Äì help unlock an experience that offers something more to both customers and employees?', 'As the car industry becomes more sustainable, vehicle hardware is becoming more robust, while electric vehicles tend to need less maintenance due to fewer moving parts and higher quality components. Additionally, the increased adoption of driving assistance systems and onboard sensors can decrease the risk of collisions and improve the predictability of wear and tear. These factors are all resulting in aftersales, which has until now been the primary customer touchpoint after the initial sales and delivery process, involving far less frequent interactions between customers and car manufacturers.', 'There may be a reduction in the number of aftersales interactions ‚Äì but at the same time, new tools, methods and business models present a golden opportunity to transform the interactions that remain into efficient and positive experiences for vehicle owners. In fact, offering a smooth experience in stressful situations like a breakdown or when routine maintenance is needed has been shown to have a major influence on retaining clients and increasing brand loyalty.', 'Right from the start of the consumer journey, digital tools that improve the user experience are becoming an increasingly important differentiator for vehicle manufacturers, while the differences in hardware are becoming less significant. In fact, a vehicle‚Äôs onboard and offboard UX is becoming just as important as its performance or comfort in consumers‚Äô decision-making processes. Beyond the purchase decision, connected apps and digital touchpoints still have a lot of untapped potential in terms of the aftersales customer journey. For example, data gathered from vehicles can be used to more accurately predict the expected lifetime of specific components and spot any potential failure before it happens, allowing timely service interventions to be made when needed instead of according to a rigid, calendar-based schedule. Digital channels can also foster proactive relationship management, with proactive interactions and over-the-air updates turning the vehicle UX into an important ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô touchpoint ‚Äì a way to stay connected to customers and deliver enhanced personalised experiences without the need to visit a physical dealership.', 'A great aftersales experience for the customer is one that minimises or even entirely eliminates classic pain points like waiting for staff to key information into a system, being asked for the same information on multiple occasions, scheduling a service visit or a lack of understanding about the work that has been performed on their vehicle and why. Digital tools can help eliminate all these issues, for example with real-time interaction during the service process that explains the reasons why a new part or procedure is needed. This kind of proactive, transparent communication not only saves customers‚Äô valuable time, but can transform the whole experience from a negative or neutral one into something much more positive.', 'For the OEM, creating a seamless, efficient and integrated process starts with visualising the current information architecture and understanding where existing customer and vehicle information is collected and where new information is entered ‚Äì for example in the dealer and workshop management systems, CRM systems and spare parts catalogues. The goal should be to create intelligent services and touchpoints that can use the data from various systems without making the back-end complexity visible.', 'While much of the focus is naturally on the customer, employees are also a crucial part of the equation. With lean, integrated and well-structured processes and systems to work with they can perform the right tasks to the best of their ability, avoid frustration and contribute to creating a great customer experience. Skilled and dedicated employees are an invaluable asset in aftersales, and they will not only be happier with the right tools and support, but also more loyal.', 'Aftersales service points and individual employees already have a lot of internal workarounds to out-of-date processes and infrastructure. An important part of the digitalisation process is to understand how employees are already working, make the small hacks they use available to others and build solutions that share that often informally transmitted wisdom with others who can benefit from it. Furthermore, staff in workshops are increasingly faced with the challenge of information overload caused by a baffling number of vehicle variants ‚Äì a challenge that existing systems and processes, not to mention the employees themselves, are not set up to cope with. The goal of any new solution should be to help employees quickly understand what is in front of them instead of them having to know everything about every vehicle model.', 'Shared knowledge management with intelligent insights can improve efficiency and reduce the workload on service support personnel in workshops. A platform that self-validates or automates tasks reduces the risk of human error, improves decision-making and enables faster, more proactive responses when problems do occur.', 'Maintenance and repair are, by their very nature, dependent on manual labour and bound to local limitations, regulations and workforces. Integrating a variety of scattered digital tools into this setting has led to unmanageable complexity. At Futurice we see opportunities to improve operational excellence by rethinking processes and structures along the value chain through service design and integration as well as creation of different tools rather than blindly digitalising current, non-optimal practices. Remember: if you digitalise a poor solution, you will get a poor digital solution.', 'Carmakers have more and more data available, and it‚Äôs vital to create intuitive, intelligent services and touchpoints that can leverage it to assist not only in decision-making but also in operations.

While this wish is also regularly verbalised in transitions, there are often systemic patterns that prevent teams from being able to take full ownership. A great example of this is the separation between ‚Äútechnical ownership‚Äù and ‚Äúfunctional ownership‚Äù where one team is responsible for setting out requirements and the other for implementing them, and one of these responsibilities remains with the incumbent team. Another example is the existence of roles where individuals function as gatekeepers between the team and the users, such as the commonly seen Proxy Product Owner role. This role provides mediation between the product owner and the development team, reviewing product backlog items and later accepting them. While this might sound valuable in theory, the role is highly vulnerable to the customer-vendor antipattern and could prevent direct contact with end users, which is critical for teams to feel ownership over their product.', ""Transferring knowledge about the product and its development is an important aspect of any transition, but it's only one part of the story. Indeed, the term ‚Äúknowledge transfer‚Äù is flawed in itself as it implies that you could simply copy-paste knowledge from one brain to another, just like copying files on a computer. Building up knowledge is a complex process that develops over time, so reaching the required level of understanding encompasses much more than simply turning up and listening to a presentation."", 'Building up the receiving team‚Äôs knowledge and ensuring transparency regarding progress is already fairly difficult ‚Äì but even if this challenge can be overcome, the knowledge alone is not enough. To illustrate this point, think about cooking a meal. Having a good recipe and understanding how to follow it (knowledge) won‚Äôt automatically make you a good chef! You need to practice over time in order to gradually convert your knowledge into ability. Traditionally, the progress of a transition is measured by the ‚Äútransferred‚Äù knowledge and not by the emerging ability of the receiving team.', 'In product development it‚Äôs become extremely common to refer to the Stacey Matrix or the Cynefin Framework and to follow their suggestions for decision-making. However, software transitions are often approached as though they should be part of the simple domain: expecting clear cause-and-effect relationships, mechanically applying best practices, setting up a predefined plan and then simply executing it. Yet most software transitions exhibit many hallmarks of the complex domain, such as unknown factors and unforeseen events, which calls for the kind of ‚Äúprobe-sense-respond‚Äù approach that we tend to see in agile frameworks. This requires us to have a clear goal in mind while also remaining humble enough to accept that our assumptions might be incorrect and that our actions can have unintended consequences.', 'Being unable to follow a predefined path or ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù during the transition processes for our two mobility products, we were faced with the question of what guidance we could follow to make good decisions. Rather than a cookbook, we needed principles! So, inspired by the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, we developed the ‚ÄúProduct Ownership Transition Manifesto‚Äù. Two of the principles might already sound quite familiar, and as with the original manifesto, while we give due emphasis to the items on the right, we focus more on the items on the left:', 'Below are some examples of how we applied these principles for our two mobility products.', 'To give the transition aim and direction, both teams, together with their stakeholders, started by clearly and openly defining a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. It‚Äôs pivotal that you know whether your primary goal is to follow an insourcing strategy or simply to lower costs. Continue to openly communicate your rationale, reminding your team and stakeholders of your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù.', 'The next step in our transition was to build a mixed team consisting of members from both the incumbent group and the receiving party. This left us with a huge team of 20 members, so we immediately split this down into two mixed teams. This split was made between the two products that were developed by the original team, meaning we now had two cross-functional mixed teams that were each handling a single product. Carrying out the software transition was now the responsibility of these new teams, who decided on the next most valuable steps for a successful transition. This contrasts with seeing the transition as an externally steered transfer activity.', 'In this setup, knowledge ‚Äì and even more importantly, ability ‚Äì were now continually emerging among the members of the receiving party. This has more similarities with the biological process of osmosis, where a substance gradually flows from one region to another naturally, without any external push or pull. And rather than ‚Äústeering‚Äù the transfer, leadership was responsible for creating a favourable environment for this osmosis process to unfold.', 'We made sure that each team had a team coach (in our case a Scrum Master), who was also aware of the intercultural aspects of the collaboration. Especially in the beginning, it‚Äôs important to be aware of cultural aspects, however the longer and more closely a team works together the more they develop their own team culture that begins to supersede existing national and other cultures. At this stage, you need to be careful not to ‚Äúover-culturalise‚Äù.', 'Over time, this enabled the receiving party to take over end-to-end ownership of elements of the product. These end-to-end elements were rather small to begin with ‚Äì we called it ‚Äústory ownership‚Äù at this stage, but this gradually expanded to ‚Äúepic ownership‚Äù and finally ‚Äúproduct goal ownership‚Äù. We put a lot of emphasis on developing real end-to-end ownership, in contrast to the team only being responsible for certain phases of product development (like discovery or implementation). Splitting ownership according to development phase results in common problems such as significantly increased lead times and the ‚Äútelephone game effect‚Äù. By not doing this we really helped the receiving party to quickly develop a real ‚Äúskin in the game‚Äù.', 'We started the transition with a short, intense series of knowledge transfer sessions, afterwards switching to a more hands-on approach where team members from the receiving party quickly started to work on product backlog items in sprints. To support the emergence of abilities, we applied best practices from agile software development like pair programming and mob programming. Getting people from the incumbent and receiving parties to collaborate actively in sprints helped tremendously.', 'To track the progress of the transition, we worked with an ‚Äúability map‚Äù ‚Äì we intentionally chose not to call this a knowledge map. We started by defining the relevant product development ability areas and developed a scale that included examples of observable behaviour (e.g., ‚ÄúThe person does easier tasks by themself and works together with the team.‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe person adds value to the project, but still needs help with harder topics.‚Äù). We then ran reflection sessions at monthly intervals, where team members assessed their own product development abilities. All self-assessments were made fully transparent within the team so that individuals could easily assess their own abilities in relation to others‚Äô. While this approach is clearly not an accurate scientific process, it did create valuable insights into our progress.', 'As with the Agile Manifesto, documentation can refer to documents written before or after implementing code. Classical software transition approaches try to create lots of documentation even before a single line of code is written. This can go as far as writing low-level design documents in a futile effort to make sure that the receiving party knows exactly what to implement. On the other hand, extensive system documentation is also often created and seen as the main medium for transferring knowledge.', 'In contrast, we worked with a product backlog that was co-created by the mixed team and the product owner. Running product goal setting and story mapping workshops together with the whole team served us well in this context. Of course, we made sure that the results of these workshops were properly documented, which is not too difficult if you‚Äôre working with virtual whiteboards like Miro or MURAL.', 'In addition, we put a reasonable amount of effort into maintaining system and user documentation. We saw this as being the collective responsibility of the whole team, making it part of our ‚ÄúDefinition of Done‚Äù to have the necessary transparency over what‚Äôs expected in terms of documentation.', 'Instead of coming up with a predefined strict deadline, we decided to measure our initial progress and then, based on this, forecast the point when the receiving party should take over full responsibility for the product. This forecast was constantly updated based on our latest learning. We didn‚Äôt use the number of knowledge-sharing sessions we were running as an indicator of progress, instead we looked at the emergent abilities within the receiving party. Our ability map helped us to visualise this progress and communicate it towards our stakeholders.', 'In order to increase focus on our transition and have clear goals to work towards, we decided to define quarterly transition goals alongside our product goals. These transition goals included things like reaching a certain level on the ability map and reaching the next ownership level.', 'We also regularly ran so-called ‚Äúcheckpoint sprints‚Äù in which the incumbent party was only operating in the background, or even not supporting the receiving party at all. These checkpoint sprints served as experiments where we could simulate the phase when the incumbent party would have finally left the product team. We also used the insights from the checkpoint sprints to plan further software transition activities.', 'Our transition process is not yet fully completed, so it‚Äôs too early to draw any final conclusions. However, there are already three important lessons that I‚Äôve learned from the experience so far:', 'Transitioning software products is a complex endeavour, with many surprises along the way. Working with the principle-based approach outlined in this article helped everyone involved in our transition to respond to these surprises competently.', 'Curious to learn more about this topic? Check our mobility page to dive deeper and learn more about our approach to the industry.']","['Insourcing product development knowledge that has previously been outsourced', 'Freeing up development capacity for innovative products that is currently tied up in more mature products', 'Team-driven osmosis over externally steered transfer', 'Developing ability over transferring knowledge', 'Close collaboration over comprehensive documentation', 'Responding to change over following a plan', 'Creating end-to-end ownership for a product takes longer than many classical transition approaches. However, it‚Äôs already visible that this approach is more sustainable as it creates teams with real skin in the game.', 'As this approach appears to be slower, it‚Äôs essential that you have management buy-in right from the start. Without this, you‚Äôll find yourself dealing with constant backlashes and attempts to drag you back into traditional transition approaches.', 'It‚Äôs important to communicate your progress transparently and be honest about the state of the transition at all times. This will increase your credibility and allow you to retain the trust of your stakeholders.']"

The business value creation potential of analytical techniques is considered sky-high, rivaling the introduction of the internet and smartphones. Still, there is much demystification to be done and many stories to be told to help companies capture the remarkable business value of data.', 'Machine learning (ML) is a core data value creation technology. Sanoma is a large European media and learning company. In this article, we focus on how machine learning has been put to work at Sanoma to transform the core customer experience and deliver business growth.', 'We are thankful to Timo Rinne, VP Digital, at Sanoma for collaborating on this in-depth article with us. You can read through Timo‚Äôs key takeaways on the Sanoma ML journey at the end of this article.', 'Sanoma is one of the companies leading the way in the use of advanced analytics in the Nordics.', 'For years Sanoma has demonstrated its strategic commitment, sharp business focus and bold experimentation within advanced analytics. In particular, the company has gained significant experience in using ML to create a loyal customer base through personalized, contextualised and timely content. Sanoma‚Äôs machine learning solution portfolio is extensive, with the capability to experiment rapidly with new ideas and further improve existing production models and solutions.', 'In business terms, Sanoma has been able to deliver an impressive return on investment (ROI) thanks to these efforts. The question ‚ÄúCan machine learning create business value?‚Äù has already been proven multiple times. Sanoma has been able to move forward using advanced analytics as a core part of their day-to-day work that is now built into all media operations. The plan is to continue to identify advanced analytics opportunities and deliver solutions.', 'Based on a generalized framework of data maturity Sanoma can be identified as an advanced user of machine learning in operations.', '', 'Data and advanced analytics have been recognised as a source of competitive advantage for the future. This recognition has made it possible to integrate analytics workflows in core business value creation and day-to-day operations.', ""With multiple successful point-solution production use cases the value of data and advanced analytics have been clearly demonstrated. Now there's a shift towards holistic ML portfolio building which enables optimisation of entire value streams instead of point-solution optimisation."", 'Sanoma has been able to build a strong technological base for moving forward with advanced analytics use cases. A common data enablement layer provides shared capabilities for data collection and analytics, respecting and complying with data privacy legislation. With more business unit centric data business cases Sanoma has been shifting towards a data mesh approach where business units self-manage data for their use cases.', '  When should organisations consider data mesh?', 'As Sanoma‚Äôs various business units have quite different value drivers, Sanoma has built data teams close to the units‚Äô value creation core. In all units there are a few different ways of working that suit the business units‚Äô operations overall. There is a clear shift towards more aligned ways of working and the inclusion of business unit-specific multidisciplinary teams in order to cut the time to market of advanced analytics use cases with end-to-end implementation capabilities.', 'In order to prove its value, advanced analytics has historically been developed using the help of centralised teams. This has enabled shared capabilities that could develop core data enablers and prove the value. Currently there is a team of highly skilled advanced analytics professionals from which business units can source dedicated skilled individuals for their business cases. This has enabled a deeper understanding of the business unit-specific value creation logic and better alignment with business goals.', 'High-quality journalism and customer-centricity are the themes that define the strategy of the Sanoma news business. All of the advanced analytics projects are built to support these two themes. Furthermore, ‚Äòprivacy first‚Äô is a core guideline for all solutions.', 'This is how high-impact ML opportunities are identified in Sanoma‚Äôs news business.', '', 'The diagram contextualises the opportunity identification, prioritisation and planning process and how it consists of thematic layers which together form the opportunity space of potential ML business cases. Let‚Äôs go through each layer in turn.', 'This is where high-level guidelines related to the main strategic business objectives are set. It consists of the top-level strategy, the ambition level within data and advanced analytics, and the current data maturity of the organisation.', 'Sanoma‚Äôs top-level strategy, as well as its data strategy and data maturity, have already been discussed.', 'Sanoma has adopted a strong privacy-first approach for developing new ML solutions, with data minimisation as one of the core tenets. This demands that all solutions should minimise the amount of data collected and minimise the length of time the data is stored. From a legal point of view, GDPR and the data protection act create hard limits on what can be collected. Another guiding factor is journalistic integrity, which states that for all news sites the final decision is always made by journalists. The explainability of ML solutions is also seen as a mandatory requirement.', 'This layer focuses on operational value creation in which the organisational structure, the business unit and its resources, the value streams and the limitations are taken into consideration.', 'An example value stream at Sanoma boils down to the essential mission of journalism: how to provide important information to customers in a timely and efficient manner.', 'This can then be divided into five bigger themes:', 'Editorial planning: Understanding what is important and interesting to customers.', 'Article production: The core value-creating part of the journalistic process.', 'Distribution: After the content has been produced we need to make sure that users find the most interesting content on the right service, at the right time and in the right context.', 'Paywall: The commercial side of journalistic services. Presenting customers with content that could give them additional value, but they don‚Äôt yet have access to.', 'Subscription: Providing customers with a plan that best suits their needs.', '', 'Sanoma uses key performance indicators (KPIs) to direct the alignment and efforts of business units. These can often be high-level metrics, but as operational value creation teams often feel they cannot effectively influence high-level metrics, they often need to be broken down into smaller and more manageable targets.', 'KPIs can either be mapped to objectives and key results (OKRs), or helpful tools such as value-stream mapping can be used to make things easier to handle. This linking makes sure that the concrete objectives of the business unit directly guide ideation by linking top-level strategic targets to actual development ideas.', 'Example of a KPI: Increase active Sanoma accounts', 'Example of an OKR objective: Create a usage habit for a new user', 'Example of an OKR key result: Increase total time spent across user devices by x%', 'OKRs are again broken down into specific and more granular drivers that are close to the day-to-day business operations. This allows us to measure the impact and gives a starting point for the impact estimation and ROI calculations as we can estimate how big a change we would require to recoup the estimated investment. At this stage it should be noted that not all drivers can be mapped directly to monetary impact; business consideration should be applied to balancing monetary drivers and, for example, quality drivers.', 'Example of a driver:  Increase number of sessions per user', 'This is the layer where the identified drivers are finally mapped to concrete ML (and non-ML) development ideas.', 'Development ideas are created in, for example, a workshop using the established mapping as a starting point. At this stage, plenty of development ideas should be added even though they might be technically or otherwise limited as in the next layer ideas are pruned to just a small prioritised subset. Existing solutions can also be mapped here in order to carry out a gap analysis and see where previous efforts have been directed.', 'Example of an ML development idea: send personalised and contextual notifications at the right time to the right channel/device.', '\nIn the picture above a partial mapping chain is shown for the content distribution process.', 'The main goal of the prioritisation phase in the mapping process is to cut down the list of possibilities by carrying out light impact estimations, with heavier ROI calculations for a select few. There are multiple frameworks available, for example, some Sanoma teams are applying Impact, Urgency and Effort analyses.', 'Impact analysis: Every ML development idea contains some elements of uncertainty, but if there is evidence available that something can be improved, or that the results fluctuate, there is a good chance that it could be improved with ML.', 'Because ML projects have an element of uncertainty, one should take into account the different routes that the project might take; this could be that some portions or sprints might need to be redone in fast iterations in order to get results. The project team should also be ready to kill their ML darlings if all accessible avenues are tested and nothing seems to stick.', 'Effort analysis: Effort should not only include the developer time required but also all the stakeholders, training, infrastructure and maintenance related to the ML development idea.', '\nUrgency analysis: This is to assess the business criticality of the use cases. This boils down to assessing clear functionality gaps in the current portfolio. For example, an incremental model update could bring some uplift to the current model, but in terms of urgency it would most likely be low as there is already a solution in place which yields results. Examples of high-urgency cases could be launch blocking, a core ML feature or something concerning a mandatory privacy regulation.', '\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/prioritization-matrix', 'These two matrices help to map ML development ideas in relation to each other. From the matrices, you can start selecting ML development ideas in the following order for more detailed investment calculations.', 'Easy wins ‚Äì High impact, high urgency and low effort', 'Must do ‚Äì High urgency', 'Big bets ‚Äì High impact, high effort (building longer road maps)', 'Incremental ‚Äì Low effort, low impact (day-to-day continuous improvement)', 'Avoid/Later ‚Äì High effort, low impact', 'After the calculations are done, the readiness to take the solution into use and the continuous improvement potential is assessed.', 'Organisational aspects:\nThe most important thing to consider is the organisational readiness to take advantage of the developed solutions. Most ML projects only generate value if they are fully integrated into the process for which they are developed. This often requires training for end-users and a plan for how the solution is rolled out, and an understanding of how these things influence the current process.', 'This is especially important in business cases where the solution heavily modifies current processes. A good example of this in the Sanoma case would be how the news front page is structured. Frontpage layout has been done in pretty much the same way for hundreds of years: editors manually select content for a certain position and it is shown to all users in that specific position. Then the personalised frontpage was introduced, which was a huge process disruption where every user got a personal frontpage and the editorial selection process of the frontpage was transformed completely.', 'This was critical to take into consideration in the solution planning phase when the editorial workflow was analysed in-depth and necessary tooling was created to help journalists manage change.', 'Technical aspects:\nIn general, ML solutions are never fully finished ‚Äì some will absolutely require, and others can greatly benefit from, further development and design iterations. All ML solutions have some maintenance needs attached to them.', 'This means when assessing the effort and investment ‚Äì but also the impact ‚Äì one should calculate the workload associated with a few additional sprints, as there is a good possibility that the information collected from the solution‚Äôs performance leads to new improvement ideas that have the potential to multiply the total effectiveness of the solution.', ""Lastly, maintenance should not be overlooked as often it is time taken out of the team's future development potential, so one should try to understand the maintenance needs as accurately as possible."", 'In the Sanoma case where there were only small, dedicated teams, the trade-off between maintenance work, new development and continuous improvement was extensively weighted as more maintenance work would cut significant chunks out of the time that could be dedicated to continuous improvement. Especially for solutions on the verge of being taken into use, emphasis needs to be placed on the continuous improvement needs coming from journalists and business.', 'In hindsight, keeping the focus on continuous improvement has paid off at Sanoma. For example, the continuous improvement work related to news personalisation has increased the outcomes dramatically.', 'To decrease the maintenance and continuous development workloads, Sanoma solutions lean heavily on managed services from cloud providers.', 'At Sanoma, in order to justify significant investments in data, analytics and AI, all ML development projects are directly linked to top-level strategy and business KPIs, with results translated into impact on the KPIs. This end-to-end linking has worked as a great communication tool for business stakeholders and other teams. It is much easier to justify development when you can show the direct strategic effect it has produced. This is especially important with continuous incremental improvement.', 'Continuous improvement was the key element that made, for example, news personalisation work. As Sanoma is one of the earliest adopters of personalised frontpage functionality in a digital news service globally, there was no clear blueprint of how it should be done. The lack of blueprint was very clear from the significant impact it had on the journalistic process and from the modest results it achieved in the early piloting phase. Because of the uniqueness of the solution, a heavy, iterative AB-testing approach was taken into use where fast simplistic solutions were continuously deployed to assess their overall potential. This allowed Sanoma to improve the results significantly.', 'As Sanoma is quite far along in its data maturity journey, it has become clear that ML solutions need careful monitoring. Dashboards have been developed with the purpose of understanding how personalisation solutions work and how they impact content distribution. Operational dashboards were mostly monitored by the team with notifications and recommended actions to relevant stakeholders if anything out of the ordinary was detected. On top of this, weekly stakeholder meetings were held in which the weekly performance and AB tests were discussed and action plans for any deviations were created and followed. This helped all key stakeholders to understand the situation, which in turn helped the full-scale production use.', 'How has this kind of approach helped Sanoma?', 'A clear focus: Deriving ML development projects directly from top-level strategy and business KPIs ensures clear focus and that scarce resources are allocated where they will make the most meaningful impact for customers and business.', 'Organisational alignment: It gives all teams clear points on which they can attach their work and see which items are interlinked between multiple teams and their objectives.', 'Impact measurement: With a full-mapping strategy-KPI-OKR-driver-ML development project, all use cases have clear success metrics attached to them with a link to processes they contribute to in the value stream of the business.', 'Portfolio view: End-to-end mapping gives an overview of all developed and possible solutions in the right business context. This can be used to effectively assess where there is coverage and where there are apparent gaps that need to be addressed.', 'Team impact: Contextual mapping allows team members to understand better the business impact they are trying to achieve. This is important as it also gives the team members tools for forming a deeper understanding of why they are doing something and helps them question whether the selected use cases are the best way to achieve the desired results.', 'Communication and transparency: With complete mapping from strategy to an actual ML development item, teams can clearly communicate what is being done and why. It provides quick contextual information within and across business units as top-level strategy and KPIs are linked to ML development projects. Especially as ML development projects can still have quite obscure and hard-to-understand value, placing ML development projects in the context of direct business impact provides all stakeholders with a better understanding.', 'News has always been about providing information to the mass with a touch of serendipity to help you discover new things. With the ever increasing amount of visits, and increasing depth and breadth of the content we have in the digital age, we came five years ago into a conclusion that we need to be highly relevant to our users in every single one of those visits.', 'This meant that we would need to treat someone who visits us the first time today differently to someone who has visited us already three times. Same goes for our special interests we have as users, someone is into Premier League football and someone else into cooking.', 'To give all the users an optimal experience we believed we have to go personal, to leverage ML and AI and the cloud technologies to deliver a personalized experience to all our users that adapts continuously to their usage. In our transformation from print to digital there had been two transformational waves - introduction of desktop computing and then mobile. We believed that personalization would be the next transformational wave. It really turned out to be just that, big time.', 'News and journalism are special. Our mission is not about optimizing economic drivers or user KPIs. It is about journalism. When we started the personalization journey, the markers of what harm can be done with AI and data were all there - the intelligence was used to purposefully impact election results in different countries and the algorithms of the facebooks let the users find people thinking the same way, leading to extremism and increasing hate speech, along with other problems.', 'For these reasons the mission and ethics were at the core of the project since day one. The journalists and editor in chiefs were involved in all steps, we were careful not to give algorithms data that could lead to polarization, we used explainable models only, and took time to test and see that we did not narrow, but rather widen, the perspective with personalization. AI is a core part of Sanoma environmental, social and governance (ESG) guidelines.', 'The results of this five years journey are historic and groundbreaking and I believe we have just touched the surface of what can be done. The next five years will definitely be just as groundbreaking as the past five have been as we continue to push intelligence and insight into more of our core processes and value streams.', 'Timo Rinne, VP Digital, Sanoma Media Finland, News & Feature Media', 'About Sanoma', 'Sanoma is the leading learning and media company in Finland with operations in eleven countries across Europe.

After graduation, I moved back to Brazil for work, then went back to Mexico, and eventually took another job offer at a startup in Silicon Valley in California. After we achieved product stability, I left the startup, and travelled the world for another year and a half. Later, I completed my masters in Helsinki and Paris, including a project in Tanzania. What I learned during my travels was that I am a building type of person who needs to create and build things. Besides, I learned to cope with different people and environments and I discovered that at every moment of life, I have the power and privilege to change my environment and circumstances.', 'Definitely. Personally, I really enjoy the process of absorbing my surroundings and adjusting to a region as part of the cultural learning. When it comes to working conditions,  the different places all have their pros and cons. While I experienced India as the country of extremes and the Indian corporate culture as quite hierarchical, the San Francisco start-up mentality is also extreme in its own way. In more modern companies in Latin America, you can find very close relationships between co-workers. Some of my closest friendships date from my time there. Europe is very employee-oriented. Both employees and employers see the importance of a good work-life balance and no one questions the value of vacations and taking some time off to recharge. These are personal observations, based on my own experience.', 'Silicon Valley is a special place and I do miss it. I haven‚Äôt found another place with such a specific mix of people from all over the world who feel it is within their power to change the world. I benefited a lot from having access to some of the brightest minds in tech there, and I learned a lot. A mix of factors made me leave San Francisco. At the time, I was extremely happy with my contribution to the project I was part of and I felt it was time to move on. At the same time, I understood that Silicon Valley can make you feel very disconnected from the rest of the world. I‚Äôve always been involved with the needs of developing nations. Also, I felt I was ready to try something else. So I used my time after leaving Silicon Valley to travel around the world for one and a half years.', '', 'Munich weather. :) I also noticed that Munich is the southernmost city in Europe with the highest salary for software developers. In the end, my decision to move to Munich was a combination of factors. I knew Futurice from Helsinki, and was pleased to discover another office in Munich!

Today, and especially during the lockdown due to COVID-19, I place an even greater value on the green inside and around Munich.', 'The people! The company culture has been very important to me when choosing a new company to work for, and Futurice was a perfect choice. I also really like the relationship between tech and design at Futurice - always moving together. And lastly, I really enjoy that Futurice allows me to try new things, especially new technologies, languages and ecosystems. What could be improved? I think I would like to see a more diverse client base. Munich is very automotive-centered, but I think there is a lot more creative and innovative stuff happening here, too. I am already excited to put myself out there to find these clients at meetups.', 'I‚Äôm happy to engage with any project that involves innovation and/or the freedom to use new technologies. I also really like open-source philosophy, and I am hoping to become more engaged with open-source projects. Generally, I feel a project that contributes to society is a good cause to get invested in.

Download the publication here, and learn more about our approach to the mobility industry here.', 'Human history has been deeply impacted by the ways in which we get around. Over the last couple of centuries industrialisation and then globalisation have relied on the movement of people, goods and ideas. And while the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the fossil fuels it uses has been a major facilitator of this, it has brought both economic benefits and severe environmental consequences.', 'In general, moving people and goods accounts for about 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions. And while there are already technologies being deployed to reduce this, a major challenge is finding new solutions to the most significant ‚Äòtransition blockers‚Äô, many of which are financial, meaning it is more expensive to choose a greener mode of transport. Part of the solution has to come via partnerships between companies from different industries ‚Äì completely new forms of collaboration that haven‚Äôt existed before. Yes, manufacturers are responsible for developing electric vehicles (EVs), but to achieve the pace of change we need, we also require new data-enabled business models and digital services that compel people to use them.', 'The e-mobility sector faces many challenges globally. Many of the solutions in this field are new, small, and need financial or legislative incentives to support them as they mature and scale up ‚Äì for example in the form of government subsidies or scrappage schemes to help achieve price parity between electric and ICE vehicles. Building and maintaining the infrastructure we need is also a challenge. To charge a nation full of EVs requires a dramatic evolution of our energy production and distribution networks: where, how and when energy is consumed and stored.', 'Read more on electrification of the mobility industry here', 'EVs need batteries, and we have seen enormous investments in battery development and manufacturing. Competition for the materials needed to make the high-capacity, fast-charging batteries needed today is already reshaping the global geopolitical landscape. This is problematic if material extraction is done unethically, manufacturing is done unsustainably or if they are not recycled properly. In short, we need better batteries and an improved infrastructure to use them in. The UK government-funded Faraday Battery Challenge is acting as a facilitator, backing new ideas and novel partnerships to the tune of 246 million pounds. One beneficiary of this funding is Birmingham-based Aceleron Energy, a company that is working to create the world‚Äôs first serviceable, upgradeable and recyclable lithium-ion battery. This kind of circular economy thinking is a fundamental design principle when it comes to e-mobility solutions.', 'E-mobility is more than just electric drivetrains; it includes the interconnecting systems and infrastructure of electric transportation for people and goods. The intersecting nature of these systems means that e-mobility can be the great connector, weaving new patterns at all levels from individual private vehicles to municipal and international transportation networks. This means that, rather than an industry or even an ecosystem, e-mobility is an environment ‚Äì a collaborative space for professionals who want to dedicate their careers to the meaningful pursuit of addressing climate change. However, this appetite for collaboration can be hampered by the lack of a consistent approach to innovation. Remedying this requires a combination of domain expertise, critical digital capabilities and advanced facilitation skills.', 'Collaboration is especially critical in the e-mobility environment because very few individual companies are able to fully cover the EV customer experience from end to end. Therefore OEMs, energy providers, battery manufacturers, charging infrastructure players and local authorities must come together to create value for consumers, businesses and, by extension, society as a whole. Among other things, this requires removing some of the barriers and complexity that come from transitioning to, and operating in, the new mobility paradigm, and in doing so meaningfully accelerating the transition to carbon-free mobility. In addition to businesses, the public sector and universities must also expand their collaboration in this dynamic environment. The right partnerships enable a deeper and broader climate impact ‚Äì and are often the difference between commercial success and failure.', 'Once the right partnerships have been formed, the next big challenge in the field of e-mobility is how to validate and create new solutions and get them to market as quickly as possible. Futurice has long been involved in many different sectors, so we have a deep understanding of how relevant expertise and best practices from one industry can be applied to another, helping partners to innovate together and achieve common goals.', 'The best way to achieve this is through rapid co-creation. Rapid co-creation is the act of cross-functional teams iteratively creating new user-centric solutions at speed, frequently validating ideas and concepts and de-risking at every stage of the innovation process. For successful rapid co-creation it‚Äôs important to have the right people in the same room, plus a foundation of high-quality research and insight, a shared language and the right tools. You also need to know how to best utilise the data you have access to and can gather.', 'This is where our Lean Service Creation methodology comes into its own. It begins with determining precisely what is needed and then efficiently creating the service to meet that need with as little waste as possible. Our methodology is a blend of three principles: design thinking, agile development and a lean startup mentality. These principles are about evolving the culture of an organisation, be they startups, scaleups or long-established industry leaders. The net result is a user-centric approach that transforms an organisation through practical delivery of new digital solutions.', 'Data ‚Äì or more specifically, converting data into business value ‚Äì is another crucial element in the increased adoption of EVs. There are opportunities for companies at many levels, from improving operational efficiency, to optimising sales and marketing activities, enhancing the customer experience, and identifying completely new revenue sources.', 'At Futurice, we see our role as helping e-mobility companies to create commercially viable services and business that take us closer to a carbon-free mobility environment. We can do this by helping to facilitate data-driven innovation at the intersection of the various industries that come together in the e-mobility space. Ultimately, it starts and ends with people, and we firmly believe we‚Äôre better together.', 'Octopus Group is one of the most disruptive and progressive companies across the financial services and energy sectors with more than 2,500 employees serving 2.5 million customers, headquartered in UK. The group‚Äôs renewable energy business is disrupting a ¬£2 trillion industry by using technology to make the green revolution faster and cheaper for tens of millions of customers.', 'Octopus Electric Vehicles exists to support people on their transition to a green future and mobility plays an important role. We talked to Claire Miller, Director of Technology & Innovation at Octopus Electric Vehicles.', '\nClaire Miller, Octopus Electric Vehicles', 'How are you working to fulfill your purpose as a company?', 'Currently, we‚Äôre working with companies to enable their employees to make the leap to EVs through salary sacrifice schemes. Our focus is on providing a great experience ‚Äì that great customer service all the way from somebody first looking at an EV all the way to ordering through to it being delivered. And on through the life of that lease, so that at each point, whenever they need to speak to us, they get that brilliant Octopus experience.', 'What do you see as the key to providing those amazing customer experiences in the digital realm?', 'We put the customer at the heart of what we do and let that dictate and determine how we design products and experiences.

Why would you make it complicated?', 'Besides user-centric design, what do you see as other vital aspects of creating memorable user experiences that help us inspire people to make the transition to EVs?', 'Using data in a high-impact way is essential. This places some serious demands on how both your own organisation and your partners gather and process data. Data quality and APIs are common bottlenecks in this area. We want to do more than just keep the customer roughly updated. We want them to have an experience. Getting a car is a big deal, and getting an EV you‚Äôve chosen should be exciting. Some of the tech in these cars and the models coming to the market is incredible. The features are like science fiction and the experience should reflect how amazing that is.

There is a bright future ahead for those who stand up, react, and earn their customers‚Äô trust ‚Äî which is exactly what we concentrate on in this blog post.', 'We all know the situation the world‚Äôs in right now, but instead of grieving what‚Äôs lost, we encourage you to seek what‚Äôs possible. The best starting point is to understand what expectations today‚Äôs travelers really have. They are more ecologically conscious and have more requirements for safe, smooth, and personalized traveling. Through climate change, sustainability is now longer just a nice add-on. It‚Äôs a must. Even if groundbreaking clean technologies in aircraft engineering lie years ahead, there are still countless possibilities for the people and businesses to make an environmental impact. Now, let‚Äôs see how digitalization can help in all this.', 'In the current situation, short-term impact is key to keeping the show on the road. Both airports and airline companies need to adapt to the ever-changing rules and regulations by innovating easier, digital ways for check-in, pre- and post-flight procedures, etc. In addition, hygiene is just as important. These application areas can be divided into categories of infrastructure, open data, digital touchpoints and biometrics, virtual control rooms/IoT, and other innovations. The solution is agile development‚Äîunderstanding the customer pain points and responding to them by creating better services that are easy to use and update.', 'Fundamentally, the digital transformation in the travel industry is about developing services to deliver a better experience to passengers by adopting and implementing new technologies and integrations with existing ones. The goal is to create a smooth experience which offers a seamless flow not only through the airport or on a plane, but from passengers leaving and returning to their front door. These solutions not only drive results but also create completely new business models.', 'The customer challenges must be first prioritized, and then the plans must be based on these findings. This is the way to build trust, and therefore customer loyalty. The easier customers can solve their problems by themselves, the better. Stronger focus on customer needs means improving the user experience in all and across the channels, as well as digitizing and personalizing the whole travel experience. Enriching the customer experience is the key here‚Äìit‚Äôs all about creating a seamless and connected travel experience and improving the way the customer feels about their journey. This includes the chatbots used to book a trip, the smart devices that support booking a parking spot or airport lounge, personalized information about the traveling updates to the AR applications that help guests navigate their destinations and book hotels. In developing door-to-door customer journeys, ecosystem thinking is needed. Ideally everything that customers need is in one place. For example, Lufthansa has integrated its tickets with Deutsche Bahn. In business travel, there is an urgent need for more flexible service packages and benefits.', 'New technologies can deliver personalized services to customers worldwide. This is based on something you already have, and what you gather more of every day‚Äìbig data. By gathering information on individual flight history, preferences, habits, social-networking and use of services, and using AI and algorithms based on passenger profiles and location, you can provide them the right information at the right moment. Machine learning enables customizing new services, communications, interactions and additional sales, and this is only the beginning.', 'It‚Äôs an endless world of new possibilities, and we at Futurice are ready to help you take the next step.

It‚Äôs time to think bigger and ensure the future of mobility serves both people and the planet.', 'This article is part of Finding the way forward, our publication focusing on new mobility in the age of data, platforms and ecosystems. Download the publication here, and learn more about our approach to the mobility industry here.', 'The past few years have seen a rapidly growing degree of awareness on sustainability, and more importantly, increasing adoption of sustainable practices in businesses across industries. This is particularly important for work against climate change, which depends on collaborative effort on a global scale.', 'Make no mistake, organisations in the mobility business are at the very centre of this transformation. Roughly a quarter of global CO2 emissions come from the transportation of people and goods, which is a fairly clear indication that prompt action is needed.', 'This, of course, applies to developing new services and offerings as well as adapting existing ones to better tackle the challenges at hand. This article will discuss different ways for the mobility industry to approach sustainability challenges.', 'For the past few decades, human-centric design has been a key element of design and innovation studies as well as a prominent principle in real-world use. Building on Maslow, human-centric design is largely based on the fulfillment of basic human needs such as physiology, safety, social and individual needs as well as self-actualisation.', 'This mode of thinking, however, comes with a major issue: short-term thinking and emphasis on individual needs at the cost of the big picture and society ‚Äì things like the environment, overall traffic flow, or safety ‚Äì does not contribute to a sustainable world for the collective. As we‚Äôve already learned in several large cities, e-scooters are admittedly very convenient, but they are also problematic particularly for the elderly and people with disabilities when haphazardly parked. We believe it‚Äôs possible to change the direction of this development, but we need to adapt our thinking, tools and models.', 'People have the tendency to favour comfort, and often choose the path of least resistance. Preferences don‚Äôt change overnight, but we can help change behaviours by incorporating the UN‚Äôs sustainable development goals into product and service development to create services that are better for the planet and people.', 'To make this happen, it‚Äôs time to evolve human-centric design thinking into something larger and more sustainable, and embrace planet-centric design instead.', 'This shift involves not just updating methods, but also including sustainability into criteria for deciding between different options and courses of action. We need to start asking ourselves what impact our opportunities have on the environment and society, and only move forward with business cases with a positive sum total. Our Lean Service Creation methodology, for example, approaches this with a canvas dedicated to sustainable design that helps teams assess the overall impact of their products and services also beyond the individual user.', 'The idea of planet-centric design is to take the foundation of human-centric design and build on top of it towards common good, rather than abandon the previous paradigm altogether. Planet-centric design isn‚Äôt concerned solely with the environment, but also covers social issues, economic stability and sustainability on a strategic level.', 'Properly addressing these issues can offer significant competitive advantages and help secure new business as well as solidify relations with existing customers. Post hoc greenwashing efforts, unsurprisingly, lack this effect.', '', 'There are many ways to approach sustainability. Startup businesses have the ability to adopt and encode sustainable ways of working directly into their DNA, while on the other hand, incumbent companies enjoy the luxury of utilising their existing assets and product portfolios to make a big difference.', 'When it comes to sustainability, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions due to the enormous complexity between ‚Äì and even within ‚Äì different industries and domain areas. When initiating the development of new products or services, it is necessary to agree on relevant (and sufficiently ambitious) sustainability criteria for the context at an early stage, and ensure common understanding through concrete examples.', 'This naturally places a lot of responsibility on product and service designers. Evaluating and selecting valid criteria for sustainability should involve careful 360¬∞ research: reviewing studies from relevant academic and business domains, forming hypotheses, and validating them with experts ‚Äì ones who aren‚Äôt only familiar with the mobility sector, but also have a deep understanding of sustainability. After that, on a more practical level, assessing sustainability should involve systematic experimentation and testing hypotheses under real-world conditions.', 'In short, sustainable mobility is about creating increasingly sustainable business models by strengthening the offering of different modes of mobility and boosting them with new technologies and the smart use of data. The decisive factor will be how we‚Äôll succeed in using different modes of transport in a sensible manner to reduce individual traffic and habitual journeys.', 'What makes the most sense varies greatly from situation to situation. The overall offering is expanding gradually through intermodality empowering intermodal mobility""), and ideally, the goal should be to create more opportunities of everyday mobility.', 'Thanks to integrations and a wealth of data, external factors such as weather, distribution of vehicles, local demand, traffic jams, construction sites, and CO2 emissions can be taken into account in real time. Slower vehicles such as e-scooters and cargo bikes can further increase flexibility by complementing the traditional offering, and in new residential areas, shared fleets can help plan flexible mobility concepts.', 'But the abundance of data also has a flipside: it adds more complexity, making it more difficult for people to make informed decisions on their own. This, in turn, lowers the barrier for consumers to choose the cheapest option at the expense of the environment. Fortunately, making sense of messy situations is a prime use case for artificial intelligence (AI). Implementing AI to quickly calculate different variables, identify problems and analyse scenarios will be instrumental in helping the masses make better decisions.', 'Additionally, rapidly growing cities mean increasing numbers of people on the move. This translates into more traffic in metropolitan areas, and introduces new challenges in terms of safety, reliability, and maintenance. The situation calls for more attention to the division of space and physical traffic arrangements as well as new investments into smarter, data-enabled traffic control measures.', 'Real-time traffic analysis enables the optimisation of traffic flows on the basis of data. Combining location-based insights with cell tower data can help avoid traffic jams and save time, and by extension, also lower the risk of accidents. Identifying congested areas as well as the time and duration of traffic disruptions can be massively beneficial in predicting and relieving problems before they actually manifest.', 'The next step beyond proposing the shortest and fastest travel options is suggesting those with the lowest carbon footprint. The automotive industry has also taken interest in the overall life cycle emissions of its products ‚Äì in addition to just direct local emissions of vehicles ‚Äì and is turning its production plants more sustainable and efficient. Recycling, renewable raw materials and new energy sources play a central role in this.', 'The mobility sector has been seen as relatively independent in decades past, but today it is in constant interaction with other industries and areas of business. This is particularly evident in the current shift towards electric vehicles.', 'The evolution towards sustainability is by no means a solo effort. It requires hardware manufacturers and operators to network and cooperate with the political and scientific spheres, and establish strong economic partnerships with component manufacturers and recycling specialists as well as with green energy suppliers, banks and insurance companies, and a retailer and service network. It also calls for business model innovation ‚Äì like we are already seeing in areas like battery leasing, car subscriptions, delivery services or fast charging solutions.', '', 'The large-scale adoption of electric vehicles will also introduce new questions and challenges related to sustainability. For example, figuring out what will happen to used battery cells once they can no longer be used in the vehicle requires creative thinking to give them a second life as electricity storage, and designing a service model to adapt usage to e.g. weather conditions and to extend the service life of the battery before the valuable materials are recycled through a dedicated ecosystem partner.', 'The circular economy mindset has been an important driver of sustainability over the past few years, and consumer attitudes are changing as well. Campaigns advocating against planned obsolescence are also highly relevant in the mobility context, as we‚Äôve already seen in conjunction with discussion around the life cycle of inexpensive bike share fleets and early e-scooters, as well as the right to repair movement.', 'The change is also propelled to a large degree by public sector support and obligations that target manufacturers. In France, for example, deliberate obsolescence has already been criminalised. Initiatives aiming to increase supply chain transparency and ensure fair practices in the smartphone industry are more than likely to land onto the mobility sector as well.', '', 'On the individual level, user needs will never remain constant throughout the course of life. People change jobs, move to new neighbourhoods, have children, and start new hobbies.', 'This has always meant switching between different modes of transportation, and will continue to do so ‚Äì but as new options emerge and become more accessible, ownership is becoming less important compared to flexible access and mobility as a service.', 'Additionally, demand can change with new subsidies and incentives. The mobility transition is a challenge for society as a whole ‚Äì switching to greener options is not a self-explanatory process if it means having to live without amenities or sacrifice freedom of choice. According to a survey by T√úV, ‚Äúmany city dwellers will only give up their private car when alternative mobility offers are similarly flexible, comfortable and safe‚Äù ‚Äì something that remains next to impossible to offer with current infrastructure.', 'To solve this issue, many employers are already looking beyond traditional corporate fleets, and instead providing their workforce with mobility budgets ‚Äì monthly allowances that employees can use on various means of transport to get from A to B.', 'Rural areas have their own set of challenges, owing to lower user counts that make it more difficult for service providers to reach critical mass to make a profit. In these areas, expanding previously existing systems has significantly more potential ‚Äì for example, enabling parcel delivery vehicles to also transport passengers.', 'Enabling technologies play an important role as well. In order to enable new solutions, car manufacturers can build in features to simplify shared use also with strangers ‚Äì from planning who gets the vehicle and when, to managing access and sharing the cost of ownership.', 'Mobility can become more sustainable, but also more personalised and flexible at the same time ‚Äì not just for the most privileged individuals, but for as many people as possible. Technology is a great enabler ‚Äì but it will only help us move towards a more sustainable future if we allow it.', 'Learn more about our approach to the mobility industry here.', 'The illustrations in this article have been designed with resources by Freepik.']","['The mobility sector needs to look beyond the needs of individual users, and focus on what‚Äôs good for the big picture.', 'Sustainability can take many shapes in mobility.

Taking some learnings from those events and sprinkling on some no-code mystery made the perfect setting for the participants to engulf themselves in the unknown.', 'So we had ventured to the wilderness with our laptops, electricity, internet, and an undisrupted flow of coffee, soft drinks and snacks. Hacking started on Friday evening and the demos were to take place on Saturday evening. To set the mood, we also watched the movie classic Hackers (1995) to maybe learn a few tricks from their playbook.', 'The mission briefing was simple: Try out one or many LCDPs and create something that you can demo for other participants at the end of the hackathon. ‚ÄúAnything‚Äù meaning: a working UI, possibly interaction with externally hosted data, working Identity and Access Management etc.', 'Participants were allowed to purchase some individual licenses (e.g. a ‚Äúdeveloper account‚Äù), but no huge investments should be made to get the job done - after all the platforms one promise is to keep the costs down. As we would soon learn about the wide variety of LCDPs licencing models, this was a pretty good restriction in terms of monetary investment.', 'For demoing purposes, we also set up a few different databases with mock data in Azure which could be connected from the public internet (secure routing from the SaaS platforms to internal data sources is another topic entirely). This would be quite common scenario in the real world, where a custom application is required to somehow interact with the business data stored somewhere (on-premise on in cloud services)', 'And so the competition was on!', '', 'As the amount of different platforms is enormous, we had pre-selected a bunch of the most known brands as well as a few lesser known products. Over the course of the weekend, we tested out following products:', 'Most of the platforms offered at least a free trial or fully free developer accounts, but those unfortunately come with some limitations we will learn a bit later. All of the mentioned platforms made it possible to start trying them out in a self-service manner.', 'We would have also wanted to try Visual Lansa (as it has been advertised in many places), but the only way to start working on that technology required a call with their sales and that didn‚Äôt work out so well with our hackathon schedule. As with any SaaS applications, I feel that there should be an easy try-before-you-buy approach also for these LCDPs which are sold for the ‚Äúcitizen developers‚Äù, as this is mandatory to validate the technology and see if it is at all usable for your use cases.', 'Also it should be noted that Salesforce Lighting relies purely on the Salesforce ecosystem where Microsoft Power Apps require the Microsoft Dataverse as its main source of data and piping any external content to either of these platforms would have required quite extensive work to be done in advance. These are not the platforms you just set up and start developing but, if the groundwork has been done, the experience and results would have been quite different.', 'As a bonus, we used the Node-Red platform to create REST APIs in a ‚Äúlow-code manner‚Äù in order to provide data from our Azure-bound databases for the LCDPs (for those which could only connect to external data using an API). This test was the result of several platforms lacking the possibility to connect to any external data using a native connector that could be used to access a certain type of database. This is by no means a production grade solution to the connectivity requirement in any real life use case, but we honored the LCDP mentality and tried it anyway.', 'As stated earlier, most of the services offer a self-service signup where you can get to work simply by giving a few details about yourself - no credit card needed! This allows you to get the general feeling of how the platforms work and enable you to experiment with building the UI with different views etc.', 'For quick prototyping purposes, you can create simple UIs quite easily (as an alternative for designer apps like InVision, Figma and Zepplin). This would in practise mean interactive wireframes, as utilizing the off-the-shelf standard components might make visual designers lose their minds as modifying these components to look & feel like a corporate design system is not very feasible. There are themes built inside some platforms, making it possible to quickly change the main color palette etc. Basic input fields and buttons are what work well out of the box.', 'But what is an UI without data? Most platforms offered some way to access external data. These native connectors varied quite a lot in their ability to work with different database products. Appgyver offered only a support to utilize REST API endpoints while OutSystems had native support for (the very enterprise-y) Oracle, IDB2, MSSQL and MySQL. Some platforms require you to purchase a license just to get access to external data sources, so be prepared to start paying in early stages of development unless you only utilize the data that is produced and consumed inside the app itself.', 'What comes to AWS Honeycode, you simply cannot connect any external data sources to it. Period. You have the tables created inside the app to store any data produced by the users and that‚Äôs it. Also you can‚Äôt add any images to the apps, so you are basically left with an interactive form maker to input data into a spreadsheet hosted inside the application itself.', 'For user management, many platforms had this built in / included in the basic license to some level. Usually this means some set of internal users who share the same level of access to the system. For external use, platforms require extensive licenses and these license types vary a lot. With OutSystems, you need to have the Standard version (10k / month) to support any ‚Äúexternal users‚Äù, so if you are building an end user facing product, this is the minimum level required (no matter if you have a single user or thousands). And you need to buy an extra license if the number of users is above 10k (no price available on the website).', 'With Appian, Salesforce & Power Apps, you‚Äôll end up with per user based licensing that can range from 6eur/login to 15eur+/external user/month and even higher costs for internal users with more functionalities that are offered inside the platform. This will bring the total cost of ownership very high if the service you are building would be published to external users and you start measuring the number of users in hundreds or thousands.', 'At any point during the weekend was our hacking crew not presented with options to select where to host our services. Browsing the documentation of the biggest services reveal that you can indeed influence the region where your software is deployed, but for all services this is not clear. Most platforms have been certified for HIPAA, PCI DSS etc. based on their Security & Compliance pages, but the information is scattered all over the documentation and it is not easy to get all the facts from one place.', 'The deployed infrastructure varies a lot. For example, in the case of OutSystems and Appian, you are actually getting an AWS VPC deployed to some AWS region with few security group rules in place. You don‚Äôt have direct access to manage the underlying security rules etc.', 'Platforms such as OutSystem & Appian also offer on-premise hosting for the top-tier paid plans. However, diving deep into the security documentation indicates that e.g. OutSystems requires IIS6 support enabled on your Windows server, which indicates that the core system might rely on some outdated components, which raised quite many questions from security point of view. Hosting a paid LCDP on-premise actually also ""doubles the costs"", as you are paying for the license AND for all the hardware and management of the service in your own data center.', ""All things above considered, the most critical thing to keep in mind with any LCDP is the complete vendor lock once you've selected your platform of choice. After you‚Äôve started to build some solution on top of a paid LCDP, that‚Äôs the platform you will be stuck with for good. The license costs etc will keep rolling in the future and all future development must be done with the technology offered by the platform vendors. This is something that requires a lot of risk assessment and calculating the lifetime costs of your service. A simple application can be set up with quite minimal costs, but depending on the features the system would utilize, the end result might be extremely high license costs in the coming years."", 'In case of custom, open source based development, a well thought out service can be moved from one cloud platform to another as well as the development responsibility transferred to a number of vendors quite painlessly. Also the costs of the infrastructure are usually measured in the hundreds / month rather than several thousands, even tens of thousands per month.', 'There are ways to ‚Äúexport the codebase‚Äù. E.g. for OutSystems, the ‚Äúunpriced‚Äù Enterprise plan (‚Äúcontact sales for quote‚Äù) is the only option offering exportability of the codebase (meaning you can technically get your application out of the platform, but only when you cancel your plan completely). The exported code is something that technically can be compiled and make work elsewhere, but any modifications to it are practically impossible due to the layers of machine generated code without any developer documentation.', '', 'Writing this as a representative of a custom software delivering consultancy, it might make me as biased as the platform vendors pushing their own technology as I would be pushing my custom approach. But also, as a consultancy, we at Futurice always focus first on delivering the best value for our Clients and help to select the best tools that get the job done. If that tool in some case would be an LCDP, we would surely recommend that.', 'Based on our few days of exploration, the main use cases for the platforms would be quite limited in scope, number of users, and focusing on a dataset that is hosted within the platform or inside the vendor ecosystem (e.g. Microsoft and Salesforce). High vendor lock-in risk combined with the inability to export and develop the services outside a selected platform possess very high business risk as many of the platforms are in early stages and might go out of business (taking the solutions built on top of them down with them).', 'In terms of long-term maintainability, security, and finding talent to keep the business rolling, it is quite obvious that these platforms have a long road ahead compared to productized SaaS services (one-size fits all software) or fully custom software built on top of widely used open source technologies with many vendors who can maintain those solutions long into the future.', 'LCDP doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúno training needed‚Äù. To leverage the capabilities of these platforms requires to thoroughly go through the platform developer courses (e.g. OutSystems has quite extensive video training materials) and most likely participate in classroom sessions for intensive training. There are support portals with peer support available, but it will be very tricky to find solutions for problems in any company-specific use cases.', 'The main selling factor of LCDPs (as stated by their builders) usually focuses on the myth that ‚Äúcustom software takes a long time to build, a team of a dozen developers and a large sum of money‚Äù. From the point of view of long-term software developers (+myself as something between tech & business), we have mixed feelings.', 'If you do master your platform of choice, you can get certain types of apps done quicker than coding from scratch. This however requires a lot of training and the platforms come with quite expensive licencing models where you could end up paying 120kEur+ a year just for keeping the solution online (OutSystems Standard plan) for a system which would run as ‚Äúcustom code‚Äù on Azure or AWS for fraction of the cost. Besides the running license costs, you would most likely end up paying external specialists the same rate as for any custom built solution, so the total cost of ownership would be on par with the custom built one.', 'For highly complex apps, the platforms would struggle to provide enough flexibility and security controls to satisfy all the requirements of a business critical application. As the infrastructure is always a bit of a black box and you have very limited control on e.g. the security settings, deploying these apps in an environment where personal information or other highly confidential information is processed would be quite risky.', 'So at the end of the day, would we recommend a no / low code platform to our Clients in any use case?', 'As we consultants tend to say, ‚ÄúIt depends‚Äù.']","['Appgyver', 'Appian', 'Appsheet', 'AWS Honeycode', 'Mendix', 'Microsoft Power Apps', 'OutSystems', 'Salesforce Lightning', 'Server Gardens', 'Wavemaker', 'Retool (not actually a low-code platform as is)']"

But transitioning away from a traditional, centralised approach requires a change in the mindsets and striking a balance between autonomy and organisational-level governance. This kind of cultural shift can be challenging ‚Äì the key is to start small but think big and iterate on the way forward.', 'This is the third part of our data mesh blog post series and will focus on the toughest part of the whole data mesh paradigm: the people and culture. We‚Äôll consider the following:', 'If you haven‚Äôt already read the earlier posts covering the basics of the data mesh paradigm and its technological aspects, you might want to first read:', ' When should organisations consider data mesh', ' The role of technology in data mesh architecture', 'According to Zhamak Dehghani, the creator of the data mesh paradigm, businesses handle their complexity by breaking the organisation into smaller domains that are independently managed and have their own clear goal. This removes dependencies within the organisation and allows more agile and lean ways of working. In the same way as business is restructured into domains, Dehghani argues that technology and data should be too. This leads to the creation of domain teams that are responsible for owning, developing and serving data products related to their domain.', 'Domain teams should be small enough to maintain agility and shared targets. The optimal size of a Scrum team is often considered to be between three and nine people, and similar team sizes should be seen in data mesh domain teams as well. These teams should be cross functional, including data engineers, scientists, designers and developers that can fulfil the domain‚Äôs needs. Having independent teams doesn‚Äôt mean that they can‚Äôt share talent, but it should be clearly defined where individual responsibilities lie. The goal of team independence is to ensure an individual domain team doesn‚Äôt need to wait for other teams‚Äô input to progress their goals and deliver new iterations of their products.', 'Having small teams focusing on narrow targets and visions enables horizontal scaling as teams can advance different aspects of the same product simultaneously. More cross-functional operators such as a marketing team or COO can feed ideas to different domain teams to advance interests that cover multiple domains. These actors working across domain borders have a critical role in ensuring the end product advances in a desirable direction.', 'Even though the domains are independent of each other, communication should happen across the mesh network. This means that product teams should have open and shared demos, retrospectives and knowledge-sharing ceremonies. This ensures that domain teams don‚Äôt become too fixed in their own opinions when it comes to things like technological decisions and architectural design patterns. Open discussion ensures that the technology validation enabled by the data mesh paradigm has a positive outcome for the company as the results of hypothesis testing are communicated between experts.', 'By shifting from a monolithic, centralised approach to the data mesh paradigm, cultural change and business process renewal is inevitable. Substance and data professionals will need to change not only their existing ways of working but also often their whole outlook on how data is viewed. One of the key differences is to start thinking of data as the main product rather than a mere by-product or consequence. At the same time, teams and individuals utilising the data should be treated as customers.', 'In a monolithic, centralised setup accountability remains with one centralised function and responsibilities are often given to individual people. This results in hyper-specialised roles like data protection officer or data governance manager. In the world of data mesh, organisations must remain comfortable with trust and responsibility being shared across multiple domains. The ideology must shift from trusting a single, centralised function to trusting multiple smaller teams.', 'In the big picture, organisations need to find the optimal state between domain autonomy and organisational-level governance. This state will differ greatly across industries and even between individual companies in the same sector. At first, autonomous domains may find local decision making difficult and require more organisational-level governance, but in the long run these capabilities will develop and more decisions can be made on a team level.', 'Data mesh is not an approach to implement thoughtlessly based on top management decisions or without a clearly defined need or limitation in the current way of operating. The need should rise internally, starting on a small scale and testing hypotheses in small iterations. One team should start experimenting due to acknowledged need and internal motivation towards the data mesh ideology. This team should develop a strictly defined data product, own its data and serve it for others to use.', 'The rest of the organisation can continue with their existing approach until the results of the experiment show positive outcomes that justify expanding the experiment further. At no point should the organisation leap to holistically replacing all the existing pieces at once, but instead continue to gradually add more teams to the experiment. Implementing data mesh architecture all at once based solely on a management decision to replace a company‚Äôs current way of organising would be doomed to failure.', 'In the early stages of the data mesh journey, the self-service infrastructure platform and other tools related to the architecture shouldn‚Äôt be the main concern. These will be developed and iterated throughout the journey, and placing too much emphasis on them early on will make the financial return of the experiment tougher to justify.', 'As with any other type of reorganisation and development work, the first initiatives should focus on quick wins that have significant business outcomes. Therefore, selecting the first domain teams to experiment with the paradigm is critical to its overall success.', 'As discussed in our technology-focused data mesh blog post, the data mesh paradigm is not a technological challenge. However, it‚Äôs a major cultural step that requires organisations to adapt to completely new ways of working and organising, as well as needing them to provide trust and freedom to their teams. The desire for change needs to originate from the business teams and the journey must consist of experimenting, learning and iterating organically.', 'There is no one-size-fits all blueprint for adapting data mesh. With the lack of real-life implementation examples, the adaptation builds strongly on small-scale experimentation culture and on figuring out effective ways of working within the existing landscape. To start with these new processes and forms of trust will face change resistance. Therefore, demonstrating positive results early on and getting commitment from top management is crucial.', 'Read more about the Futurice approach to data and AI, and our competences around data platforms.

However, most cloud services focus on serving the status quo, with a monolithic, centralised approach. The road to data mesh architecture requires custom solutions, yet the challenge remains more organisational than technological.', 'This is the second part of our data mesh blog post series. For a brief introduction to data mesh and discussion about the sorts of organisation it can benefit, see the first post in the series: When should organisations consider data mesh. In this post the focus will be on the main technological challenges related to the data mesh paradigm. These challenges are discussed based on their suggested approach, main complexities and how ready current cloud technologies are in these areas.', 'Zhamak Dehghani argues that in shifting the paradigm from traditional to data mesh architecture, technology is irrelevant. Let‚Äôs take a look at this claim from the following perspectives:', 'Dividing data assets among separate business domain teams adds more pressure to create technical capabilities that enable easy sharing and integration of data products between individual domains. Traditional ETL workloads that move data between each team can lead to long development times and outdated data compared to having a centralised platform. As the domain teams are mostly concerned about new data products for their own domain, the sharing can easily be seen as an extra burden.', 'Dehghani proposes the architectural decision of offering data between domains through predefined and guaranteed interfaces. The core idea is to have a precisely standardised way in which all domains agree to share their data products for easier integration. The domain team is allowed to change their data model as long as they support earlier versions for as long as they have users. Technically these interfaces can be anything from REST APIs to specifically formatted CSV files. In the end, these standards are just well-documented practices.', 'The main difficulty faced is that many existing systems won‚Äôt be able to produce data in the desired format. This results in the creation of intermediate data transformation components that require both development work and make the overall architecture more complex. Even though the domain teams are free to use whatever technology they see fit, the defined interface might result in only a handful of tools that can easily handle the requirements.', 'The ecosystem of domain teams across the organisation must ensure that the workload of creating the interfaces from database or object storage is as small and automated as possible. Otherwise domains will either fail to make their data available or it will significantly increase the lead time of creating data products.', 'Some technologies already offer out-of-the-box solutions for easy ways to share datasets, often with close to no development required. For example, Snowflake Data Share makes it possible to share data between Snowflake accounts securely without creating any ETL pipelines or APIs to expose the datasets. The technical and security aspects are handled by Snowflake and the data queried is always up to date. The data producer simply creates a sharable dataset and grants read access to the consumer account. Many cloud providers already have their own similar data sharing tools, but these usually require both the provider and the customer to use the same technology or tooling. These types of tooling restrictions should be avoided when using data mesh methodology. Currently the cloud market doesn‚Äôt offer a straightforward way to share data products in a technology-agnostic way.', 'At the core of the data mesh paradigm is the freedom for domain teams to choose whatever tooling they prefer. This can easily increase the costs with different business domains running their own data solutions separately. According to Dehghani, this should be overcome with shared infrastructure that‚Äôs provided by the self-serve data infrastructure platform. Dehghani also points out that the tooling and techniques for this sort of shared infrastructure are not yet very mature in the data landscape.', 'A self-serve platform can be achieved with an infrastructure team providing APIs for each domain team to build, deploy, monitor and maintain their required software components, for example APIs to create infrastructure for a certain computing service or database instance. Infrastructure remains centralised, but is utilised and developed independently by each domain team based on their individual needs.', 'However, the current technical capabilities make creating a self-serve platform a manual process. Effort from the centralised infrastructure team is required to get access to new technologies that don‚Äôt yet have an API. This takes some autonomy away from the domain teams as they‚Äôre required to use the centrally provided component selection. In a way, this centralisation fights against the core advantages of data mesh by slowing down the lean creation of services. On the other hand, a centralised infrastructure platform can require a change in mindset when it comes to attributing costs as the divisions between domain teams can become less defined with technologies that have a shared resource pool.', 'On a positive note, with economies of scale centralising infrastructure creation can create major cost savings even in data mesh architecture. With a correctly utilised self-serve infrastructure platform, domain teams can focus on creating features efficiently with minimal infrastructure burden. A centralised infrastructure platform can also help to make the mesh a whole rather than separate data products spread across different domain teams.', 'In the end, the question of how a self-serve infrastructure platform should look comes down to organisational culture, the starting situation and views on data platform governance. In its purest form, data mesh allows domain teams to use whichever tools and technologies they prefer. This will most likely mean an increase in operational expenses, but it will also shorten the time to test and develop new data solutions, as well as validate new technologies. Meanwhile we might see versions of data mesh ideology where new infrastructure is requested from a centralised team and technology options are limited to include, for example, only a certain cloud provider‚Äôs products. While this might slow down the cycle of innovation, it will allow tighter governance and potentially result in lower running costs.', 'According to the principles of the data mesh paradigm, domain teams have the freedom to focus on adopting new data products and features as they best see fit. In practice, these features can mean anything, such as changing the data aggregation level or adding new fields in datasets. However, data mesh principles also outline that consumers of data products are not required to adapt to constant changes. Instead they can rely on the fact that earlier versions of the data product are still supported by the producing domain team with semantic data versioning.', 'Semantic data versioning makes it possible for the domain team to publish new versions of the data products according to their own preferred schedule. Data consumers can migrate to newer versions when they see fit ‚Äì and with meaningful version numbers they can easily understand what sort of change they‚Äôre dealing with. If an organisation wants tighter governance on go-live dates, the responsibility for releasing new versions can be transferred to a separate team. This way domain teams can focus directly on the next deliverable after completing the previous one.', 'Versioning is quite often overlooked in centralised monoliths, or at least done only on a small scale supporting the current and preceding version using version paths. With data mesh most data products will need to run multiple versions all the time. This creates a pressure to design failsafe versioning and to serve data from the same location whenever possible. By using carefully decided development principles, changing to a new version should be made as easy as possible for the consumer of the product.', 'Technically there usually isn‚Äôt anything that prevents data versioning on most modern solutions. However, versioning and backwards compatibility are not as common in data teams as they are in other areas of software development. In the data landscape the learning curve can be seen to be more about understanding why versioning is required and how it helps. As domain teams are often both producers and consumers of different data products, in data mesh they should quickly encounter the benefits of versioning and include it in their everyday development work. Specific tooling and services focused on semantic data versioning could also help in this area.', 'One of the major effects of data mesh could be reducing technology-related discussion, bringing the team‚Äôs business purpose to the fore. In the end, technology is just a way to create the desired outcomes for a business. In the data mesh paradigm this already starts with the organisation of domain teams, which are organised based on their shared goal and domain, not on their technological capabilities and interests. Overall, Dehghani‚Äôs data mesh principles are very vague when it comes to technology. The idea is more about giving trust and freedom to individual teams to make the decisions that benefit and advance their goals the most. The important thing is that their products can be consumed in the agreed way ‚Äì the level of technology is less important than the business and shared goals.', 'Even though we can recognise some details related to the data mesh paradigm, where technological development or at least practice changes are required, the main barriers for adapting the ideology are far more on the cultural and human side. The cloud market will see new services focusing on helping certain aspects of the paradigm in the near future. These could include tool standardisation for sharing and versioning data products, or out-of-the-box self-serve infrastructure and data security platforms.', 'Want to make your organisation truly data-driven?

This blog post will provide a brief introduction to Deno - a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript - with a code-along where we introduce some of Deno's coolest features."", 'Did you notice ‚ÄúDeno‚Äù is an anagram of ‚ÄúNode‚Äù? That‚Äôs for a reason. Deno was created by Node‚Äôs author, Ryan Dahl. He first revealed it in a talk in 2018 called 10 Things I Regret About Node.js, where he described how he attempted to right the wrongs of his own past design decisions.', 'Deno is essentially a better, more secure and shinier alternative to Node. The major appeal, as we will see in this code-along, is Deno‚Äôs lack of clutter and clunk. This makes the runtime particularly suitable for beginners, because you don‚Äôt have to worry about random files and directories like package.json or /node_modules. Deno doesn‚Äôt need that nonsense, and neither do you.', 'All the code used can be found on GitHub at minnacaptain/have-you-tried-deno-yet, but you don‚Äôt need to clone the repo to follow along.', 'Install Deno', 'Go to deno.land and follow the installation instructions. I‚Äôm using version 1.12.1.', 'Install the VSCode extension', 'I use Visual Studio Code as my editor of choice and thoroughly recommend it. To have a good time while using Deno, you should install the Deno extension.', 'Get the example data', 'Download this text file from Github onto your computer. It contains a list of imaginary students who have taken imaginary AWS exams ‚Äì and generally scored very poorly. We will parse this data and calculate their average score.', 'Install TypeScript?', 'You do not need to install TypeScript separately, because it comes bundled with Deno.', 'Check it out yo', 'Open up your VSCode editor', 'From your Downloads folder.', 'What?', 'Yes.', 'Embrace the barbarian within you. Then create a file called parseStuff.ts.', '', 'Open the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P) and select Deno: Initialize Workspace Configuration. This will enable you to use auto-complete.', 'Now let‚Äôs read that example_data.txt file that we downloaded earlier, and start parsing lines.', 'Before we proceed, let‚Äôs try to run the code to see if we‚Äôve messed something up.', 'Open up a terminal window, and try to run the code:', 'Ah, okay, yes I‚Äôm a programmer and I read error messages. Therefore I quickly understand that we need to use the --allow-read flag.', 'This is intentional, and it‚Äôs one of the cool security features of Deno. You have to explicitly state whether a Deno program should be allowed to read files on your filesystem.', 'Try again:', 'Looks about right.', 'Let‚Äôs continue writing the boilerplate for calculating average scores:', 'Running this gives us an average score of 6.7556.', 'Good!', 'Maybe I don‚Äôt want to get this example data from my local file system. Perhaps I would rather get it straight from the internet ‚Äì for example, if some fresh noob takes an AWS exam and the file gets updated with the score.

This can be easily fixed by using the correct flags (I know, because I read error messages).', 'Let‚Äôs try again:', 'Excellent, it works.', 'First, install the testing library.', 'Lol, just kidding! There is no step to install the testing library.', 'The actual first step is to put the calculateAverageScore function into its own file, called calculate.ts:', 'Then create a test file, calculate.test.ts, and write a few lines of test code. We will mock the getContent function by taking the first three lines from example_data.txt, then fudge the scores to 1, 2, 3 so that they average 2.', 'Let‚Äôs have a look at the first line, import { assertEquals } from ""https://deno.land/std@0.102.0/testing/asserts.ts"";', 'A couple of differences to note between Node and Deno. In Deno, we import code libraries with URL syntax. Once the library is used once, its contents are cached, so there isn‚Äôt a new network request each time you subsequently run your code. Note also that for Deno imports, filenames are fully specified (.ts). Local files are also imported with extensions.', 'Back to the test, let‚Äôs run it:', 'Neat! We didn‚Äôt have to install any libraries, we just imported assertEqual and we‚Äôre done.', 'If I now decide I want to publish and distribute my average score calculator function to other developers, I can do this very easily. Host the calculate.ts file anywhere on the internet and it can then be imported in its raw form in Deno code:', 'Does it work?', 'Yes it does, very good!', 'Look at our directory (yes, I know, it‚Äôs the Downloads folder, but try to ignore your sensibilities for a moment).', 'Where‚Äôs node_modules?

And the countless, countless rm -rf node_modules && npm install cycles. Also, what‚Äôs yarn?', 'Package management tends to be an afterthought, its form evolving over time as users of programming languages and runtimes develop dire needs to distribute code and borrow code from each other.

On the other hand, package management for something like C# is very user-friendly with NuGet.', 'While package management in Node isn‚Äôt the worst, Deno makes it even better. The runtime is designed with simplicity of package management in mind, and it shows. This is what programming with JavaScript should be like.', '', 'The one (giant) thing that‚Äôs missing from Deno is a rich ecosystem. Deno isn‚Äôt directly compatible with Node ‚Äì it‚Äôs not meant to be. But it does mean that there aren‚Äôt nearly as many libraries available.', 'What‚Äôs the solution?

She is an advocate for Interactive Design of Services and Products - invested into the future societal implications of improved culture work.', 'I have always loved art, and was drawn towards a combination of arts and IT. So when my parents were bold enough to allow me to leave for another city even though I was only 16 years of age, I joined a course to become a Multimedia Technician. In Portugal, people tend to appreciate marketing/advertising and aesthetic design, but not so much the technical and functional aspects of it. So, to find the perfect combination of arts and technology, I moved to Germany to finish my diploma studies at HfG Schw√§bisch-Gm√ºnd in Communication Design. That‚Äôs where I created my first interactive installations. Later, I found my passion in human-centered design and how to create user-friendly and meaningful user experiences.', 'The books that had the biggest impact are ‚ÄúDesigning for Interaction‚Äù by Dan Saffer, which inspired my vision of building services that people can interact with and envision zero UI design, and ‚ÄúEverything is miscellaneous‚Äù by David Weinberger, which shows how data is interconnected and relevant to identify better business models. I also find inspiration in philosophical thinking, like Marshall McLuhan‚Äôs theories that describe communication as societal evolution. To sum it up: the way I perceive the world might be very different from yours. No matter the speed of technological development, it is the human user that matters in the end. You can program nearly anything, but you cannot program human behaviour. User behaviour can only be explained by neuroscience, psychology and sociology.', 'I find myself in between two generations: one that had limited technological possibilities when growing up and the digital natives who were born with technology in their cradles. With this societal transformation, the impact of design and my work has changed, too. Today, my focus is very much on leadership. I want to pass on my experience to the new generation and give a voice to the builders and designers of the future. Thinking about a more general legacy, I think that design has the power to identify problems anywhere, solve them and make life more meaningful for people.', '', 'People really appreciate our caring working culture as well as our open and honest communication. I think all challenging situations can be solved by showing vulnerability in an honest one-to-one conversation - especially with a client. Despite the speed of business development, I am convinced that we should disconnect from unhealthy competitiveness and engage in honest communication instead.', 'My tip for building a happy team is to raise the right questions and to listen carefully. Good collaboration can only happen in a safe environment where every team member can openly share their thoughts. To make sure everyone feels confident enough to bring all their ideas to the table, encouragement is fundamental, too. It is crucial to know your own weaknesses and strengths, but also to get to know those of others. When we know what to approach and when, we can all grow as individuals. We spend quite a large share of our time with our colleagues at work. That‚Äôs why establishing a trusting relationship with my work peers is so important to me.', 'The question is: how would you define creativity? Creativity is not finding the fastest solution that makes everyone happy. To me, creativity is feeding your brain with positivity to ultimately achieve the ‚Äòaha moment‚Äô. When I feel stuck, I first analyse the problem from all different perspectives and ask my team for feedback. Usually, they help me see that the ‚Äòaha solution‚Äô is already there.', 'Books are a big part of me, so I would probably be nostalgic for good old printed books, especially their feel and smell. I sincerely hope that I don‚Äôt have to feel nostalgic for relationships with people. I hope that despite the speed of our digital era, we can maintain good relationships and deep conversations where we philosophize about the world together. We will need to keep thinking, questioning, talking and being idealistic about what matters ‚Äì simply put, we need to remain conscious human beings. I am an optimistic person and like to think that we will always find ways to deal with transformation and create something good from it.

This is great news for inclusivity in product and service design, among many other things, but there‚Äôs plenty of work to be done to see results on a larger scale.', 'Although DE&I is gaining traction rapidly, inclusive practices are still taking root in business culture, and the shift is nowhere near ready. But as organizations come to terms with the fact that diverse teams create more inclusive ‚Äì and profitable ‚Äì products and services, the demand for tools that support this development is on the rise as well.', 'In order to cater to this need, we at Futurice have come up with a dedicated tool called the Inclusion canvas. It helps product and service creation teams consider the needs of more diverse end-user groups in their work that they might otherwise overlook ‚Äì after all, the harsh reality is that a team can never be perfectly diverse or equally represent every demographic imaginable.', 'In this interview, Futurice Head of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Heidi Pech tells more about the newly created canvas and explains its benefits both in terms of teamwork and new business potential.', 'Download the inclusion canvas here!', 'The Inclusion canvas is a collaborative tool that offers an easy way for teams and organizations to make the products and services they design more inclusive. Its purpose is to make sure that teams responsible for creating these products and services have the means to analyze their choices and decisions from diverse perspectives in the development stage.', 'This has two implications in practice. First, it helps unlock new business opportunities by making solutions cater to broader and more diverse user groups. Secondly, it enables teams to take into account the specific needs of certain user groups, and encourages them to make active, conscious decisions about who their solution is intended for ‚Äì instead of excluding groups of people by accident.', 'Its potential also extends to the research and testing phases, prompting solution creators to consider whether their research and testing pools are diverse enough, and whether they may have missed some insights or potential issues due to not taking diversity into account.', 'The canvas was primarily designed for any team or organization that creates products and services, especially ‚Äì but not exclusively ‚Äì digital ones. Adopting an easy tool to make your product more inclusive should be a no-brainer for any organization, and given that it can also help broaden your user base, it makes total sense for business, too.', 'The canvas will be equally beneficial for digital consultancies and agencies as well as other third parties that support others on R&D on some level, for example. At Futurice, we will be using it in our own client projects, and it also will be a part of our Lean Service Creation methodology (LSC).', 'If you‚Äôre familiar with Lean Service Creation ‚Äì or most other service design tools or methodologies, for that matter ‚Äì you should be right at home with the Inclusion canvas as well. But the beautiful part is that it doesn‚Äôt require any sort of prior experience with the use of workshop canvases.', 'The canvas comes with instructions on how to approach the situation at hand, and what kinds of things to consider when working on it. The only additional tools you need to use its physical version are sticky notes and marker pens, and you can also use it by importing it into any number of digital collaboration tools, like Miro.', 'The canvas aims to make your solution more inclusive by focusing on three separate perspectives and focusing on them specifically with diversity in mind. The areas it covers are business opportunities, the diversity angle of an organization‚Äôs vision and strategy, and the composition of the project team itself.', 'The idea is to create inclusive solutions not only because it is the right thing to do ‚Äì but also do so in a way that makes business sense for each particular product or service, improves customer value, and helps mitigate unconscious bias.', '\nHeidi Pech, Head of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at Futurice', 'The history behind the canvas dates back to October 2020, when Futurice participated in #GirlsTakeover organized by Plan International. In line with the theme of the day ‚Äì girls and technology ‚Äì we handed the reins to 18-year-old Jessica Komulainen who took over the role of Futurice CEO for the day.', 'To engage our employees to support this cause and make a lasting impact, we organized a company-wide contest where Futuriceans teamed up and innovated solutions for some key problems girls and women face with technology today ‚Äì and made a commitment to develop and open source the winning solution. The first prize went to the Inclusion canvas, the brainchild of a team trying to solve the problem related to non-diverse and male-heavy teams building software and apps for a very diverse population.', 'There‚Äôs been a lot of talk about lack of diversity in the technology sector especially over the past decade. When homogenous teams create products for very diverse groups of users, this may result in unintended problems that come as a complete surprise. A prime example of this is Apple‚Äôs Health app, which initially lacked menstrual cycle tracking features when it was first launched in 2014.', 'Obviously, this is an issue we should address at the grassroots level by ensuring that the sector itself becomes more diverse, and includes different kinds of people from various walks of life. We already know that diverse teams build more creative solutions and perform better in the financial sense.', 'In reality, however, you will never have a team that perfectly covers all possible aspects of diversity, and the Inclusion canvas tries to address this issue in particular: If a team cannot have a perfectly diverse representation of perspectives, how can it at least think as diversely as possible to make up for it?', 'Yes, very much so. We‚Äôre hoping that in addition to solving practical problems in different scenarios, it will also increase the understanding of inclusivity topics for those who use the tool as a side effect. But even so, it‚Äôs worth emphasizing that this does not remove the need for organisations to work on their diversity, equity and inclusion issues and do their part in rectifying this imbalance.', 'One very clear benefit is that the tool can actually be used right now, while companies are still working on the diversity issues of their respective business sectors. It is an immediate remedy ‚Äì a band-aid, if you will ‚Äì while working on those long-term and large-scale improvements.', 'There is plenty of research that shows that diverse teams produce better financial results and are more creative. And it all makes perfect sense when you think about it ‚Äì by combining their thinking, many minds are more likely to create a better outcome than just one. To bring together as different minds as possible, the best bet is to have people from as different backgrounds as possible.', 'But in order to truly benefit from having diverse people in an organization, those people must feel like they have a voice, that they belong and can contribute as their true selves ‚Äì and this is what inclusion is all about. And diversity without inclusion simply does not work. If you have diverse, talented people who don‚Äôt feel included, they will most likely leave, or at the very least underutilize their full potential.', 'The first step is to find out what the state of inclusion is in your organization right now, preferably backed by hard data. This demands a lot of courage, as facing the reality and looking the pain points straight in the eye can be a humbling experience.', 'At Futurice, we started out by conducting a thorough DE&I audit to really find out what the employee experience is like for different groups ‚Äì our focus being on finding out which parts of the experience were subpar for minority groups compared to those in the majority. This helped us pinpoint our actions to the areas where they‚Äôd matter the most.', 'In addition to the audit, we‚Äôve also included DE&I as a key element in our company strategy, and created measurable DE&I goals. With the help of a roadmap we can continuously monitor our progress and ensure that we are making improvements every day as we work to reach our goals.', 'It‚Äôs a long journey and we still make mistakes, but we are committed to appreciating and celebrating diversity as well as building an inclusive, international culture with equitable opportunities for every employee and a sense of belonging for all of us.', 'The Inclusion canvas can be downloaded here.

Yet in a complex system, it is hard to ""guess"" which changes actually will cause downtime and which will not.","['Downtime deployment example cases', 'A Remark: Load Testing in general', 'Architecture', 'CI/CD Workflow in GitHub Actions', 'The load-testing application', 'Conclusion']","['In your project, you might have a strict requirement to have zero downtime when deploying to production. Yet in a complex system, it is hard to ""guess"" which changes actually will cause downtime and which will not; the most reliable way is to attempt an actual deployment and see if any break has occurred to the API. This blog post describes how I automated the task.', 'In my recent blog I wrote about the zero-downtime deployment of a serverless stack. We were able to achieve that - mostly. But we also found some alterations still incur downtime. Here, I recap these cases.', ""First, the zero-downtime deployment of a Lambda was observed for routine code changes without changing the external properties of the Lambda. But if the Lambda handler function was renamed, there was a break in service during deployment.  It happened because the Lambda configuration was updated with a new function name, then Lambda continued to set up, but it took some time. During that time, traffic was sent towards the new function name, but the updated source code wasn't there yet, and an old source code threw an error about an unrecognized identifier. Couple of minutes the endpoint was replying with HTTP 500."", 'The second time,  we faced a bizarre behavior of the serverless.tf AWS API Gateway module. The API Gateway has a ""Default route throttling"" parameter (with two numbers, ""Burst limit"" and ""Rate limit""). If the throttling was not configured manually or via Terraform, in AWS Console the limits are seen as ""Not Configured"".', 'The Terraform module allows to specify the following  default route throttling settings:', 'So when you run terraform apply, the aforementioned throttling parameters take the values specified. Now, consider the situation when we first added this default_route_settings  section and then decided to remove it. Once it was removed from the Terraform code, one could expect to go back to the ""not configured"" case. However, Terraform instead sets both throttling parameters to zero, effectively denying all the traffic (all endpoints always return HTTP 429).  I have described the problem in a GitHub issue; our workaround was to never go back to undefined throttling values once they were defined for an AWS API Gateway.', 'It is necessary to know about such problems before the changes hit production and downtime becomes apparent to actual consumers. Hence, I created a small alerting framework that would notify if a recent deployment caused a downtime. This check is used against testing environments, so developers are made aware of the problem and it is then possible to address it.', 'I detect the downtime using a load-testing library that checks all API endpoints several times per second and will sense if there is any problem.  Yet I like to briefly note the role that Load Testing can play in general. Load and performance testing is often overlooked and is capturing less attention than, say, unit and integration tests. Yet,  a system should be tested at 2-3 times production load to ensure that expected and unexpected load is handled well. To replicate production behavior patterns in a test environment is very hard. Still, to have certain safeguard measures (such as basic load tests that confirm the performance) is desirable, especially if you are dealing with a custom-made application in a container and do not rely on cloud services with known performance characteristics.  We should keep in mind that, unlike simple code bugs, performance issues are not always fixable by changing few lines of code;  these might require major architecture and database changes followed by an epic-scale re-testing (and if your auto testing is scarce, then you have a problem).

When we tried to configure it, it turned out that a re-deploy would yield downtime. Here I summarize what we have learnt. ', 'Depending on the Runtime we use for our Lambda, its initialization times might lie in the range of 0.5-5.5 seconds.  This warmup time is not there if the Lambda was already invoked recently - within 30‚Äî45 minutes it can stay ""warm"". Imagine the case when your application does several calls sequentially and since you had a bit of low traffic, your Lambdas are not ""warm"" yet - your client might need to wait for many seconds and it is not nice for user experience.', 'If your case demands to exclude warmup time in most calls, you can make use of Provisioned concurrency - that is, some copies of Lambda stay warm always and provide a faster experience.  The tradeoff is that Provisioned Concurrency is not free ‚Äî the pricing can be seen on this AWS page.', 'In Terraform (using respective serverless.tf Module), the following instruction is made:', 'The Provisioned Concurrency is not applied to a Lambda in general, but to a specified ""published"" version of a Lambda. You can not use $LATEST tag for referring to a Lambda with Provisioned Concurrency.  Hence, in API Gateway that calls the Lambda, you must refer to that version of Lambda precisely, using a qualified_arn:', 'When you update your Lambda, terraform would generally start shifting your Provisioned Concurrency setup to the new version. This process is usually taking few minutes and this must be taken into account because it might result in some downtime under certain circumstances (see the next section).', 'It was also discovered by us at the time of writing (first half of 2021), that if a Lambda belongs to a VPC (which is the case for Lambdas communicating with databases within ) then re-creation of Provisioned Concurrency happens every time you invoke terraform apply even if the Lambda was not modified.  We observed this behavior while using the serverless.tf Lambda Module; I could not say whether usage of a ""native"" AWS Terraform provider would differ from that behavior.', 'Note added in proof: the approach below describes a zero-downtime deployments that concerns routine code update of a Lambda. There are still scenarios that can cause downtime. Please see the ""When downtime is still possible"" subsection below.', 'Imagine the situation: you configured your API Gateway and Provisioned Concurrency Lambda and they work perfectly together, but when you invoke terraform apply, the system goes away for a few minutes, while terraform slowly printing in-progress messages and your colleagues starting wondering about the production downtime. This is what happened:', 'Many simple tutorials online regretfully do not go beyond the basic case that does not include Provisioned Concurrency. When Lambda is connected to API Gateway using the $LATEST tag, one might not sense the problems described above.', 'This problem can be avoided as follows. There are two ways to permit API Gateway to talk to lambdas:', 'Turns out, the second option works well with Provisioned Concurrency Lambdas and generates no outage as the switch over between versions happens instantaneously. Access rights never experience any re-creation but remain in place at all times, on the API Gateway side. To achieve this, we need to pass to needed integrations a credentials role:', 'Note that the expression ""arn:aws:lambda:*:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:function:*"" uses a wildcard (final asterisk) that means ""include all Lambdas"". If you use some Lambdas that are not a part of API, it might be a good idea to allow API Gateway to reach only the Lambdas that it really needs to call. It can be achieved by inventing a special prefix to these Lambda IDs and use it in the expression above instead of function:*.', 'Again, using serverless.tf API Gateway module, we configure that Role to be used as part of integrations that call Lambdas, via credentials_arn parameter:', 'Note that for lambda_arn I used qualified_arn as I used this bit for a Lambda with Provisioned Concurrency.', 'The configuration described above works well when you need to tweak code inside an existing Lambda. Word of warning: other types of changes you make can still cause downtime. We describe below  two such cases, but there can be more, not counting, of course, the situation when API Gateway and lambdas are temporarily destroyed as a whole.', "" For instance, if the Lambda handler function was renamed, there was a break in service during deployment.  It happened because the Lambda configuration was updated with a new function name, then Lambda continued to set up, but it took some time. During that time, traffic was sent towards the new function name, but the updated source code wasn't there yet, and an old source code threw an error about an unrecognized identifier. Another downtime case is described  in this GitHub issue."", 'It is therefore necessary to test your deployments whether they contain any changes that will cause an outage. Please see my blog post Verification of zero-downtime deployments using GitHub Actions for my own take on the problem.', 'The system has to be monitored, so we can know if it failed. It does not seem very complicated to set up, but I just mention couple of aspects that we had to research.', 'We utilize native Cloud Watch monitoring and Dashboards. Conveniently, these Dashboards can be made accessible via a password-protected minisite so one can view these without a need to log in into the AWS Console (these are still password-protected).  Remember to present on dashboards and in alerts the information that you find most ""interesting"" and do not tire the viewer with the noise. If your monitoring approach is full of noise, you would immediately get used to ignore its messages and important cases will sink in the noise.', 'To ensure our Lambdas are as performant as possible, we instrument the Lambda source code with AWS X-Ray subsegments and examine the X-Ray traces for bottlenecks.', 'Below I list few cases that are worth highlighting in connection with Monitoring.', 'In Console, you can enable ""Lambda Insights"" for a Lambda function, but what about the IaaC approach? Turns out, it\'s not a feature flag of Lambda, but a special Lambda layer to be added, as follows e.g. from this Stackoverflow suggestion. Note that you need to use the current version of the Layer; besides, ARNs for the Layer are Region-specific. Check the ARN you need to consume on this AWS page. In serverless.tf approach to Lambda configuration, to enable Lambda Insights you need to mention:', 'As Provisioned concurrency can incur noticeable charges, it is always good to know that you are running just the needed amount of it. This AWS document describes metrics that can help visualize the situation with Provisioned Concurrency. I find ProvisionedConcurrencyUtilization to be the most useful metric.

There are some attempts to ensure that frontend errors are fed to CloudWatch as well, but that is usually not enough - a developer might be curious about auxiliary data. Besides, this has been already tackled  an advanced ways by existing vendors.', 'After some review of available APM tools (most of these offer both frontend and backend monitoring), we found out that Sentry fulfills our needs very well and at a reasonable price. It is well integrated with the majority of popular front-end frameworks and repository servers (such as GitHub) and provides rich information about errors and exceptions, alerting and even an ability to suggest ""bad"" commits in source control. Just a remark, an adblocker I use blocks Sentry calls by default, so to use it the service should be added to its exceptions.']","['Earlier you needed to tell Lambda and API Gateway that they are permitted to work with each other, and most likely decided that you will add to Lambda a policy to allow access from the API Gateway.  This is, on one hand, a valid way to achieve connectivity. However, as you renew the Lambda, the previous configuration is destroyed, so is the permission for API Gateway to call the Lambda. At this point, API Gateway calls lose the rights to invoke the Lambda and clients are starting to get HTTP 500 errors.', 'Then, a new version of Lambda is being created, together with its Provisioned Concurrency configuration and API Gateway permissions. While permissions are fast to recreate, Provisioned Concurrency is not ‚Äî  it takes several minutes to finalize the config. The API Gateway permissions are restored after that, therefore your new Lambda remains denied for API Gateway for some minutes. Once the configuration is fully concluded, Lambda becomes reachable again and normal operation resumes.', 'Lambda has a Policy to permit API Gateway to call it (see for example this AWS blog).', 'alternatively, an API Gateway can have its own set of ""credentials"" that is authorized to call the necessary Lambdas.

In this blog I would like to focus on the convenience of working with a project in an enterprise environment. A good system would have a modular, extendable design, has proper testing and deployment CI/CD automation, easy to monitor and detect problems. I am a big fan of no-nonsense design approaches that allow me to use my time on creating business logic and have little routine overhead.

If writing tests is difficult, for instance, the work will be pushed away and procrastinated. Just to be honest: it is sometimes psychologically hard to see ""real value"" in testing and ""new features"" sometimes take all the spotlight on the assorted planning meetings. An imaginary ""lack of value"" plus difficulty to write a good amount of tests is a recipe for disaster: systems with a low test coverage do not usually behave well, create massive negative feedback, and ruin the reputations of everyone involved, not to mention financial drawbacks. In this example, if we make testing convenient and fast to implement, these will not become an obstacle and the convenience pays off by having a better system. In my following blog post, I talk about testing, but I like to stress how convenience, in general, is important.', 'A disclaimer - what I describe here is one way to do things that come from my personal experience. It is not meant to be a rigid, set-in-stone recipe, but rather something you would, with a critical attitude, adapt to your case.', 'Here is a typical reference architecture that I employ - it is a quite common situation where CloudFront and S3 are serving static content and API Gateway + Lambda hangle business logic and interact with a database hidden in a private VPC subnet.', ' ', 'If you try to do it vanilla way, then you got to code many small resources such as copious Security Groups for every bit or, for instance, deploying Glue or Lambda sources to S3. To cut the mundane parts, we heavily rely on serverless.tf library of Terraform modules, which greatly simplifies the creation of complex configurations.', 'In professional software development, a system usually exists in several copies, or Environments, and interacts with some external systems, which I call Dependencies. The Environment is essentially a set of resources that work together.

When we have several environments, having separate AWS account for each might become unmanageable; furthermore, in some companies creating new accounts might be severely slowed down by the IT department's scrutiny.  Therefore, we usually design our infrastructure to permit a co-existence of several environments  in the same AWS account, namely using the following rules:"", 'This might sound trivial, but the opposite cases do happen from time to time, and it is important that the development team works in environments and insists on the maximal separation from day one.', 'Terraform Workspace is a way to create the same stack as usual, but isolated from ""main"" deployment, aka default workspace, somewhat resembling an Environment approach in a ""terraform way"".', 'A custom workspace is instrumental in various testing and debugging cases.

It is seldomly possible to replicate to a testing environment all data and production load patterns across your system and all its Dependences, some of the latter belonging maybe to entirely different company).  So you are opening production logs, but alas, they are insufficient and you can not find an exact reason; a natural way to proceed is to add more diagnostics or just isolating the calls made by a single client  - it is not an easy task as production systems are typically overburdened by frequent messages from all over the world, so filtering the logs might be very challenging and also very slow.', 'The following approach probably will not help you with the bugs of performance kind, but allow you to peruse production setup for the diagnostics.

Instead of generic cookie-cutter solutions, each organization requires an individual approach based on, and carefully tailored to, its status quo.', 'One of the most recent additions to the Futurice toolbox, the Connected Health Kit, was launched in March 2021 specifically for the health industry, and with this particular need in mind. The Connected Health Kit is a free-to-use set of tools reminiscent of a board game, designed to help organizations map out and analyze dynamics and workflows in medical environments and identify their problem areas to easily target and plan future improvements.', 'Additionally, the kit offers an approachable way to address these problems by co-creating new service concepts for various contexts ‚Äì not just hospitals, but also areas such as medtech, remote care, labs and pharmaceuticals ‚Äì and ideate future workflows based on emerging technologies and data. It brings together people from different backgrounds ‚Äì like doctors, patients, scientists, laboratory techs, and administrative staff ‚Äì to help find alignment and shared understanding about a given workflow in a visual way.', 'The kit‚Äôs end goal is to help simplify complex processes and make health industry workflows easier for everyone involved. To get an idea of how the kit is used, please take a look at the video embedded at the end of this blog post.', 'During the first couple of months after its launch, the Connected Health Kit has seen an overwhelmingly positive reception, and it has already sparked some very engaging interactions within the health industry. As one of our clients put it, ‚ÄúWe can see incorporating the kit into our design process whenever we want to make a change to our workflows.‚Äù As far as testimonials go, that‚Äôs pretty tough to beat.', 'Our first discussions have also yielded valuable insights that speak to the versatility and modularity of the Connected Health Kit, suggesting that the kit has plenty of potential beyond the use cases or approaches we‚Äôve initially thought of.', 'In the following, I‚Äôll go over two specific cases that demonstrate how the kit lends itself to various scenarios. The names of the organizations have been redacted for the sake of confidentiality, but these are real-world cases.', 'The first of our two examples showed that improvising with the kit is not only possible, but also highly beneficial in some cases. While discussing our suggestions for different approaches for applying the kit in our client‚Äôs situation, it quickly became obvious that their problem area ‚Äì related to value loss and pain points along the patient journey of a specific type of surgery ‚Äì was so complex that they would benefit from doubling down on the status quo investigation phase.', 'Instead of opting for a single status quo workshop, the client elected to focus more on really understanding the differences and nuances between various environments through a series of workshops before choosing the right solution to invest in.', 'Lesson learned: while the kit offers a powerful array of tools for the creation of connected and data-enabled digital services, you don‚Äôt have to go that far to benefit from using it. Thoroughly understanding your starting point and the challenges you are facing is the first step in addressing the right problems and successfully solving them. Sometimes the smart thing to do is to refrain from rushing into action, and if you need to zoom in and examine the status quo from multiple perspectives, the kit is equally capable on that front.', 'At the time of writing, we are already discussing additional opportunities in using the kit to map out a completely different patient journey and ideate possible digital services for that context.', 'In our second example, a different client was looking to digitize and automate certain laboratory workflows as smoothly as possible. The goal was to get this done without disturbing the lab process on the one hand, or burdening IT whose responsibility it is to design and implement the automation.', 'A major pain point in this case was establishing common buy-in for the project and supporting communication between the two stakeholder groups ‚Äì lab technicians and IT ‚Äì by ensuring that they both speak the same language. One particularly important aim was to avoid a situation where IT moves ahead to create a solution without proper alignment, and scientists feel it misunderstands their work or is forced onto them.', 'The Connected Health Kit was a strong candidate ‚Äì and not just in terms of being a good fit for testing and refining those automations. It is also a potent tool when it comes to mapping problem areas and making sure the lab scientists‚Äô point-of-view and needs are properly understood before an automation is created.', 'Given its inherently collaborative nature, the Connected Health Kit is by design a great way to break down silos, bring the right people together in a workshop to find common alignment, and offer them a seat at the table when decisions are made.', 'The kit‚Äôs approachable board game-style design also plays a big part in illustrating and understanding the workflow in practice and reaching a consensus in a way that‚Äôs accessible to participants from all backgrounds. In scenarios like this, the kit serves as neutral territory that helps people work on the same problem and come up with impactful solutions.', 'Just like with any other tool, the value and utility of the Connected Health Kit is dependent on the applied methodology ‚Äì how you use it, and what you use it for.', 'The real-world examples we‚Äôve seen so far, after just a couple of months since the launch, are encouraging. They offer evidence for the kit‚Äôs plasticity and adaptability, and demonstrate its potential to help untangle actual problems that the health industry is facing.', 'In our experience, when organizations struggle to innovate an established process or workflow, many of them may in fact need more than just a solution for a specific problem. In many cases, these organizations could also benefit from changing their ways of working to overcome hidden issues that may hinder innovation.', 'This is why the biggest and ultimately most helpful feature of the Connected Health Kit is that it helps and encourages organizations to look at their work in a new light, challenge their assumptions and find new ways to approach their problems, and, ultimately, work better by implementing proven best practices ‚Äì such as the ones at the core of the Futurice approach. Challenging assumptions is key to our ways of working in all areas from software and data engineering to service design and strategy work.', 'With the right tools and the right mindset, gathering around to innovate solutions to a problem can have a far-reaching transformative effect and help you evolve your ways of working and thinking far beyond the initial problem.', 'Read more about our approach to the health sector and the work we‚Äôve done together with our clients.

This post looks at utilizing shadow traffic and canary traffic in Nodejs and TypeScript to test your service under production load before going to production. There is an attached working code repository for anyone to follow along with, or even to clone and test the functionality yourself: https://github.com/futurice/shadow-and-canary-traffic-example', 'As a software developer working on Nodejs and TypeScript I‚Äôm used to having very short feedback loops. The editor highlights static mistakes as soon as I make them (think trying to access a property that doesn‚Äôt exist for a given type), the applications usually runs in some sort of watch mode and crashes instantly if I introduce a runtime error, the tests can be running in watch mode, and so on. Very long feedback loops seem to go against the very idea of Agile.', 'With this in mind, I‚Äôm terrified of the idea of building a production critical system and taking it to production without being able to know it will work as expected. I‚Äôm not against testing in production by any means, but some applications are such that the initial go-live is bound to be a big waterfall-esque change.', 'This post looks at practical ways of avoiding this fear, when operating in the popular Nodejs application environment and TypeScript programming language.', 'I was recently working on such a project for a client. We were building a New Data API to replace an Old Data API in a larger distributed system. The data API incoming request volumes are in the ballpark of 10,000 to 20,000 requests per day, so by no means web scale. On the other hand, if the API fails to deliver data, it has a huge impact on the user experience, as the end client application‚Äôs main task is displaying this data. So the idea of hot swapping the API and only then seeing if it works properly sounds, again, terrifying.', 'Note that all kinds of load creation tools such as Artillery do exist and are useful for testing a service under heavy artificial load. However, actual production load tends to be unpredictable, if not in terms of number of requests, at least in terms of variety of requests. Automated load testing helps you find out the performance limits of your application, but not necessarily the edge cases that may occur. Another aspect is time, a momentary load test might not expose issues that occur over time under load, such as database performance suffering under expensive queries, memory leaks materializing, blocking operations or such.', 'In the context of this post there are two things I want to look at:', 'Both of those strategies are usually implemented on the infrastructure level, but we decided to operate on the Nodejs application level instead. Why? Several reasons, actually:', ""There‚Äôs a working reference repository on GitHub that you can follow along with, or even run the application yourself and do any kinds of testing you wish. Note that the actual data APIs aren't about animals, but this will do for demonstrating the concept. https://github.com/futurice/shadow-and-canary-traffic-example"", 'A web client application makes a request to a microservice, which then makes a request to the data API (among other services) to fulfill the request. The microservice is written in TypeScript and runs on Nodejs in a Docker container, orchestrated by AWS ECS. The simplified infrastructure architecture looks like the picture below. In reality there is an API Gateway and authorization layer between the web client and the microservice, but that‚Äôs outside the scope of this functionality.', '', 'If we zoom inside the microservice itself we can see that its architecture mirrors the infrastructure architecture, just on a smaller scale. The request comes in on the HTTP layer, gets directed to the business logic layer (model), and the model then calls the appropriate integration client for whichever backend API the request needs.', '', 'The process needed for taking the New Data API in use requires writing a new integration client for it, and calling that. Ultimately it comes down to replacing a function call in the model with another function call. Currently it looks as simple as:', '', 'With this in mind, the model possesses a lot of power, and can be used for agile iterations in how traffic is routed to the data API(s), without having to modify the infrastructure layer. The connection from the microservice to both data APIs is direct, in that there is no load balancer in between, which could otherwise be used for traffic (re)direction changes. Even if there was, operating on application level can offer faster iterations, but this of course depends on the bigger picture case by case.', 'The idea of traffic shadowing is to duplicate all the incoming requests to both Old Data API (main channel) and New Data API (side channel). The client gets all its requests served by Old Data API, the side channel is something that the client doesn‚Äôt know or care about. However, both the microservice and New Data API can log and monitor the side channel requests as you please.', '', 'On application level the idea looks as follows. The model effectively calls both New Data API client and Old Data API client, but only returns Old Data API client to the HTTP layer, and onward to the web application client.', '', 'Note that no external references to the side channel request are stored, so no memory leaks take place. However, during the request processing the requests are effectively doubled. If you are running at near maximum capacity memory usage, and the request payloads are large, you might need to consider the temporary memory usage implications this might have. On code level it looks like this:', '', 'See https://github.com/futurice/shadow-and-canary-traffic-example/blob/main/src/model.ts#L18 for a full working example. Note how the same requestId is given to both clients per incoming request: this is very handy in monitoring the performance differences between Old Data API and New Data API on a per request basis. An example of how the logs could look like:', 'The real New Data API was starting to reach readiness in the feature set, and we had performed some indicative artificial load testing to tweak certain parameters. At this point we turned shadow traffic on from the production environment for the duration of around 24 hours. During this time the logs were aggregated so that we got data about the distribution of request durations. We were able to see that e.g. New Data API tended to be slower than the Old Data API for the fastest requests, but faster for the slower requests, providing a tighter duration spread.', 'At New Data API‚Äôs end we monitored requests and performance as well, and were able to pinpoint some problems. For example the database (AWS Redshift in this case) queries tended to get considerably slower during simultaneous data inserts, as the database resource utilization got quite high compared to other times. This led us to go after alternative solutions for data ingestion.', 'Like in the example code, the shadow traffic side channel was implemented so that it can be turned on or off with an environment variable. Future implications of this kind of solution could also exist. For example, once Old Data API is no longer in use and all main channel traffic goes to New Data API, we could have a side channel to the test/dev version of New Data API. This way we could try out performance improvements in test/dev (provided that it is similar to the production version) and see how they compare to the current production environment, before actually going to production and introducing potential performance regression to the users.', 'The idea of canary traffic is to split a certain portion of incoming requests to New Data API, while the rest are going to Old Data API. The client (web app) is therefore receiving data from both systems, according to a defined split.', '', 'Like shadow traffic, canary traffic can also be used to test the performance of New Data API gradually, without sudden effect on users‚Äô experience. However, the problem with this is that the full scale isn‚Äôt reached until all traffic is directed to New Data API, making shadow traffic a better candidate for actual testing.', '', 'Our implementation of application level canary was an environment variable, named CANARY_THRESHOLD_PERCENT in the example. In the old state the variable can be set to 0, meaning that all requests are directed to Old Data API. We can then gradually raise the percentage to e.g. 10, meaning that 10 percent of all requests are directed to New Data API, while the remaining 90 percent still go to Old Data API. Updating the percentage is as simple as editing the environment variable value and restarting/redeploying the service. On code level it looks like this:', '', 'See https://github.com/futurice/shadow-and-canary-traffic-example/blob/main/src/model.ts#L48 for a full working example. This time the logs could look something like this:', 'Note that traditional canary deployments are often automated: some readiness/healthiness checks or other KPIs are defined for the service, and if those pass the automated checks, the portion of traffic directed to the new service is automatically increased, until 100 % is reached. In our case the whole process is more manual because we are not deploying a new version of an existing service, but a whole new API.', 'We are not in production as of yet, but we have been in situations where Old Data API has failed, and we have had to temporarily redirect traffic to New Data API to avoid the whole service being down. This has worked nicely, as traffic redirection is as simple as updating the environment variable value to 100%, directing all traffic to New Data API, and restarting/redeploying the service.', 'Once we actually go live with New Data API, we can use canary to do that incrementally in a controlled fashion, instead of deploying a single code change that needs to be rolled back if anything goes wrong. After this we can remove the canary logic from the code, which means code changes on only the model layer.', 'Both shadow and canary traffic can be hugely beneficial in testing and ensuring the quality of your software before exposing users to potential effects. Sometimes the creative use of what you have available can go a long way, as long as you write your software in a modular and well structured way. Nodejs and TypeScript make this kind of testing easy, but the same principles can be applied to other languages and frameworks as well.', ""There are solutions for recording production traffic and replaying it in a controlled fashion for testing purposes. I haven't personally tested it, but ShadowReader seems very interesting and might be helpful if you ever find yourself needing such capabilities.""]","['Exposing the service to production traffic before production depends on it. This is often called traffic shadowing.', 'Gradually exposing the service to traffic. Canary deployments address this issue.', 'The infrastructure level strategies usually rely on load balancing between the client (in our case the Nodejs microservice) and the target APIs, and in our case we didn‚Äôt have load balancing in place between those.', 'Old Data API and New Data API have different API implementations, old being XML/SOAP and new JSON/REST. Therefore operating purely on network level wouldn‚Äôt have suited our needs anyway, as the integration clients need to be written separately for both.', 'The migration from Old Data API to New Data API is a one time thing, and similar capabilities should not be needed after that. This is why adding load balancing on the infrastructure level didn‚Äôt seem to make sense.', 'Making iterative changes on the application level tends to be much more flexible than on the infrastructure level, especially in the case of a one-off type of change and in our architecture.', 'We had application level logging and metrics already in place, so that we were able to leverage those directly in the performance testing, as we will see below.']"

This has given us some valuable insights, which we are sharing with you.', 'This is a particular interest of ours at Futurice, as we have a keen interest in the future of work, especially knowledge work, and the best ways to innovate, create, capture and utilise knowledge. With digital transformation changing the way we live and work, centring knowledge and capitalising on it will become the hallmark of successful workplaces across the Nordics ‚Äì and indeed worldwide.', 'Although 52% of the organisations surveyed describe themselves as knowledge-centric, our research shows the cultural transformation that so many of you are experiencing is not without its challenges. Survey responses reveal organisations are often lacking the capabilities they need in order to achieve true knowledge-centricity. It‚Äôs a challenge I have worked through myself ‚Äì in a business where knowledge is value, how can you centre this knowledge and know what you know? It is only by doing so that you can reap the full rewards of your accrued intellectual capital. These are some of my initial reflections on the study‚Äôs findings.', 'One interesting insight from the survey is how large a part culture plays in productivity ‚Äì in fact, it proves to be even more important than all sorts of scaled agile practices. Developing a knowledge-centric culture requires a combination of factors: an emphasis on experimentation and collaboration, for example, and the ability to capture, reuse and harness organisational knowledge so it‚Äôs available to employees. Supporting, recruiting and retaining the right talent requires a culture that prioritises the employee experience ‚Äì something the study found that more mature companies have already come to realise.', 'In order to encourage collaboration, which has been understandably restricted during the pandemic, we need to rethink how the future office will work. Accidental meetings and discoveries power collaboration and creativity, so we need to think about how to create the right conditions for them to happen even when people are working remotely much of the time. Collaboration can also be data-driven: knowledge-capturing tools can help set up onboarding sessions for new employees with people across the organisation, as well as helping people to reach out to others working on related projects or trying to solve similar problems. Data can help answer the question ‚ÄúWho should I talk to about this?‚Äù, unlocking knowledge, empowering employees  and increasing productivity.', 'One thing is clear: the traditional ways of managing knowledge don‚Äôt work anymore. It‚Äôs one thing to have silos of information, in individuals or databases, but you need to be able to access that information and, more than that, you need to know that it‚Äôs even there. Will a new hire know that ‚ÄòLaura‚Äô is the go-to person to find out about a particular technology? How can you quickly find out who in a certain office has the closest relationship to a particular client? If you‚Äôre starting a new project, do you need to start everything from scratch or have certain challenges already been solved ‚Äì and if they have, are these elements now accessible for reuse? Asking people to fill in knowledge areas, categorise and tag content then organise it according to a predefined taxonomy is not a viable strategy.', 'We became painfully aware of these challenges in the traditional approach in our own operations and started developing a different paradigm: harvest content from numerous internal systems, automatically index and tag and make a consolidated view available for people. The outcome of this work is new tools, like Bubble Burster and FutuCortex, that gather public data from various channels to capture what people are discussing, who is working with who and what has been worked on, allowing you to find out what knowledge you really have in your organisation. This means larger organisations no longer need to be on the back foot compared to small, agile start-ups ‚Äì they can harness the vast knowledge resources they have across their organisation. After all, it‚Äôs not size but disconnect that slows organisations down.', 'With tools like this you can also see when knowledge silos are developing ‚Äì maybe one country office doesn‚Äôt have many links to another, or certain developers are always working together. Once you know this is happening you can take steps to make connections between siloed groups to ensure knowledge is shared ‚Äì it‚Äôs often just a small nudge needed to kick-start or speed up the flow of knowledge. Having access to this information also lets you see what topics are trending, which can help you direct your strategy and ensure the whole company is on the same page no matter how many sites and countries you cover.', 'Our research with IDC shows that a company‚Äôs competitive edge is very much defined by the knowledge it has and how that knowledge is managed. Regardless of industry, it is clear that the ability to harness organisational knowledge will define competitiveness in the future. Productive future work is not just a question of technology, nor is it just one of culture ‚Äì it‚Äôs about finding new ways to combine these elements, understanding and shaping culture and harnessing data as part of this process.', 'If you‚Äôd like to learn more about how we can help you develop the right culture, practices and tools to strengthen knowledge-centricity in your organisation, please get in touch.', '‚ÄúRead the full report: The Knowledge-Centric Organization ‚Äì Maintaining the Intellectual Capital ->‚Äù']",[]

Also, last year we hosted an external event on Global Accessibility Awareness Day.', 'A little over a year ago, we added accessibility certificates to our certification program. So far, six people have gotten a certification, and many more are studying for the exams. In fact, the exact numbers are six people and 10 certificates in total.', ""We wanted to highlight and congratulate these people in the spirit of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, so here we are. But before celebrating, let's talk a bit about the certification program at Futurice in general and the accessibility certificates."", 'We have the Ultimate Learning Platform, an approach to help people learn and grow. One part of the platform is the certification program. Its goal is to help our specialists get the training they want in accessibility, cloud technologies, and other relevant fields.', ""If you're interested in learning about the other certificates in our certification program, Kalki Rose wrote about getting certified with AWS."", ""There are two accessibility certification exams employees can take in our certification program. Both of these are provided by the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP). There is also a third one highlighting people who have successfully passed the two exams. Let's look a bit deeper into these credentials."", 'CPACC is a fundamental certification, covering topics such as disabilities in general, accessibility and universal design, accessibility-related standards and laws, and management strategies. It gives a good overview of accessibility, so anyone working with accessibility could take the exam - managers, salespeople, designers, developers.', 'Read more about CPACC', 'WAS is a more technical certification. It covers many topics, from creating accessible web solutions to remediating accessibility issues in web solutions. More detailed topics are, for example, guidelines and techniques such as WCAG 2.1, WAI-ARIA, and ATAG, accessibility quality assurance, and programming practices to create accessible solutions.', 'Read more about WAS', 'CPWA is a designation earned by an individual who has both CPACC and WAS credentials. As IAAP writes on their webpage:\n""IAAP has chosen to award those individuals with a higher level credential as evidence of the significant achievement of passing both exams.""', 'Read more about CPWA', ""So, the moment you've been waiting for, here they are:"", 'IAAP Certified Professional in Web Accessibility\nFotis Papadogeorgopoulos\nEeva-Jonna Panula ', 'IAAP Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies\nKajsa Unge \nMarion Couesnon \nNuksu Aalto\nErkka Wessman \nFotis Papadogeorgopoulos\nEeva-Jonna Panula ', 'IAAP Web Accessibility Specialist\nFotis Papadogeorgopoulos\nEeva-Jonna Panula ', 'Congratulations, everyone, on your hard work!']",[]

Read about how combining data and design helped co-create and further develop Ohjus, a situational awareness system of the Finnish railroad company, VR. Now, in our third blogpost on the data & design topic, we share the best practices of how these two areas can inspire and support each other for delivering great customer experiences.', 'On average, two trains leave Helsinki train station every minute during the rush hour. The commuter traffic operations center manages disturbances caused by railroad infrastructure problems, technical problems with trains, train operators or  issues related to staff availability, for example.', 'To support VR‚Äôs operations center personnel in their fast-paced decision-making, we helped to develop Ohjus, a system that provides real-time situational awareness for different user groups, automates simple tasks and communication, and supports data-driven decision-making. Both data and design are equally important for helping the personnel react to issues that require attention. Now we get to hear the experiences of our Lead Service Designer Aino Kuru and Data Engineer Jari Hast.', '""Here we had a wonderful chance to first figure out the desired future, then the steps on how to get there and then continue to the implementation phase.""   -Aino', 'The collaboration with VR started with a vision project, where our multidisciplinary team explored both the user and business needs, followed by co-creating a vision and roadmap in order to understand where VR wants to be in the future and how to get there. Storytelling was used to communicate and validate the vision with stakeholders all the way from management to operative personnel. With a validated vision and a roadmap, we continued to the development phase.', '""To me this was the first long project where I got to work as a Service Designer from the early beginning until the MVP launch and to the continuous development phase with developers without any breaks or pauses. It was very valuable since I got to dig deep into the domain, got to know both the users and other internal stakeholders and really understand their daily work, pain points and success factors. I got a nickname ‚Äútrain whisperer‚Äù and I‚Äôm truly proud of it.""    -Aino', 'Development phase started with converting the user needs to user stories and prioritizing them in order to form a development backlog.', '""It should be kept in mind that each user story may require several technical features and their combinations, which need to be discussed together with developers and data engineers. In agile projects constant communication between design, tech and data people is a must and both the team and key internal stakeholders must be ready to re-examine the priorities when there are e.g. unexpected delays with third parties.""   -Aino', '', '""Even though we are not novices when it comes to expert systems, the breadth and complexity of the domain probably surprised all of us. There‚Äôs so much detail in how the trains and the related personnel are operated. As an anecdote, I have never produced this amount of documentation and code comments in my life.""   -Jari', 'Feedback is one of the most important inputs in a user-centered project like Ohjus. The ideas from end users are discussed with them in order to understand the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and the need behind them. Next, these needs are refined in brainstorms between designers and developers alike. Once the team has come up with a proposition or two on how to fulfill the specific need, the solutions are tested with the end users and iterated until all parties are satisfied. This way everyone, including the backend-focused engineers, have contributed significantly also in designing Ohjus. As the domain is both complex and multifunctional, it‚Äôs important that the UI communicates all the possibilities and shortcomings of the data as transparently as possible.', '""As we recognized the amount of edge cases and situations where the data cannot express the reality too well, we adopted a principle of ""first, do no harm"". That is, we try our hardest to recognize inconsistencies and error states. Our UI is very vocal when we think the data is stale or otherwise not correct. Especially in figuring out how to best handle these cases, it is paramount that everyone on the team and the users are involved in these discussions.""   -Jari', 'In a data intensive project such as Ohjus, there are also many situations where the data engineers‚Äô personal contact with the users is crucial. For example, complex topics, such as automating decision making rules for commuter traffic, require a holistic approach. To get the rules right, we need to understand the domain logic as well as the limitations and possibilities imposed by the data available. Building a rule set like this requires close collaboration between the developer/data-engineer and the user who is the domain expert.', '""I‚Äôm more a people person than a tech person and I learned a lot when listening e.g. the discussions that Jari had with our users. It‚Äôs both interesting and important to understand how your colleagues from other competences see the world and how they think. When I couldn‚Äôt contribute to the technical solutions I made sure that the relationships with our users evolved and deepened to support the continuous feedback loop.""   -Aino', 'From the start, the team has had a clear focus on good customer service. Responding to feedback is swift and feature requests are immediately taken into consideration.', '""Our users‚Äô jobs can get hectic at times and there are many situations where decisions have to be made almost instantly. Since new software always introduces at least some cognitive overhead, it is not given that everyone uses our new tool just because it‚Äôs available. One of our ways to tackle this is strive for excellent customer service and implement new requested features as much as we can. This has been a good way to get users more invested in the project.""   -Jari', '', ""In a typical setting, a service designer is the one who first dives deep into the business domain and the needs of the users. Service designer enables developers by providing the relevant and condensed bits of information upon which the developer can build the technical solution effectively. In the Ohjus project however, these roles have somewhat fluctuated. It's not unusual for the developers to explore a new topic by involving relevant stakeholders and figuring the context out. In these cases, the service designer links the new findings to the bigger picture and possible future endeavours. This dynamic way of working has been rewarding for the whole team, and has had a positive impact on getting feedback from the end users ‚Äî direct communication strengthens relationships."", '""The best part about consulting for me is when I get to talk to experts in their respective domain. In this project I got to do exactly that. I must have spent tens of hours discussing and problem solving different aspects of operating the train traffic.""   -Jari', '""In the end, Ohjus is not rocket science; it is a result of top professionals working closely together in inspiring ways.""   - Aino', 'This is what future-proofed and connected companies are built upon.', 'Previously on this topic: Future is where design meets data and Experiences of Data-driven Design from Futurice Exponential']",[]
https://futurice.com/blog/satellite-monitoring-of-electricity-networks,Satellite monitoring of electricity networks,7 May 2021,Emerging Tech,Futurice has been researching the use of satellite data in multiple domains - this is what we have learned and how we applied satellite data in real life!,"['When to use satellite data?', 'What exactly is satellite data?', 'Case study', 'What advantages can electricity distribution companies get from satellite data?', 'Satellite data can be useful']","['There are thousands of satellites orbiting Earth right now and most are observing the planet in one way or another. Satellite technology is undergoing a change from old and big machines to new fleets of microsatellites with hundreds of cubesats small enough to fit in your backpack. Meanwhile, their counterpart on the surface is changing from complex contracts and sluggish processes to user-friendly and flexible services. This change is in its early stages and it‚Äôs going to result in improving availability and flexibility in the near future.', 'The right time to look into the opportunities offered by satellite data is right now.', 'For over a year, we at Futurice have been researching the use of satellite data in multiple domains. We‚Äôve worked with Skywatch and their platform Earthcache, which offers us an easy way of ordering satellite images.', 'Even though satellite data is easily available already, it‚Äôs important to understand a few things behind the scenes. The two biggest factors affecting availability are weather and satellite orbits: poor weather prevents getting the images and you can only define the date of capture, but not the time of day. You can order images for ‚Äúnext Thursday‚Äù, but ‚Äú3 PM next Thursday‚Äù is too specific. And while you can request data from a single day, you might not be the only customer in line. So, to ensure the results you need, you should consider using longer time spans.', 'Satellite data comes in different resolutions, measured in meters per pixel, with a low resolution of 30 meters per pixel and a high resolution of 0.5m per pixel. In the low resolution images, forests, roads and fields can be identified. Medium resolution ‚Äì around 3 meters per pixel ‚Äì is enough for buildings and other big targets. And with high resolution data you can detect vehicles and even individual humans. Different resolutions are priced differently, so make sure you use the appropriate resolution for what you‚Äôre doing.', 'In  my opinion, the optimal case for satellite data in general is something that is continuous, has big enough outdoor assets to monitor and can be split into fine and coarse monitoring. With coarse monitoring, the monitored areas could be reduced into more interesting areas that could then be properly monitored with high resolution data.', 'Satellites offer a variety of data types. For most, the first one that comes to mind is a format familiar from plain old cameras. The platform we use calls it True Color format, but one could also call it a photograph. It‚Äôs an image built from red, green and blue bands of light. For the human eye, this is the most useful, but for automatic monitoring purposes we have also other, better options.', 'One notch up from True Color images are Panchromatic images, which are created by combining multiple bands of light into a sharp monochromatic image. This process creates sharper images than the basic True Color photos, but are missing colors. That might be valuable for identifying objects in images.', 'For more specific cases, like vegetation monitoring, there are computed outputs, like different kinds of vegetation maps. The one we have been using is called Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. It is based on the certain wavelengths of light green plants are absorbing and reflecting. The end result is a false color image where each pixel indicates how much vegetation is in that area.', 'The most interesting output available from some satellites is not a photograph at all. Some satellites use radio waves instead of light. These Synthetic Aperture Radars act as moving antennas sending and receiving radio signals. Radio waves are transmitted through clouds and in darkness, making it possible to monitor areas in the middle of a hurricane. The end result is a detailed heightmap of everything on the surface. High resolution SAR data is still quite expensive and not commonly available, but in the near future it could fundamentally change how satellite monitoring works under different conditions.', 'To prove the effectiveness of automated vegetation detection solutions, we received real-world examples of vegetation management from a Finnish energy distribution company. A small geographical area with the coordinates of overhead power lines and poles was used to create a satellite pipeline for on-demand images of the area.', 'The first step was to get the data based on the coordinates. Because the minimum order was 25km¬≤, we decided to order the whole general area. We had some initial problems getting the data because of cloudy weather and insufficient timespans, but it was a good lesson in the patience needed with satellite data.', 'Our initial order was for True Colour images. The data had 0.5m per pixel resolution, which is as good as it gets. As can be seen in the image below, the data does not seem really useful at first glance. The time of the capture was in the morning of a day in March. For such an early time of day in clear and sunny weather it means the sun is still low and the shadows long. Buildings and roads are easy to identify, power line poles can be seen in the snowy fields and, as the red dots on the image indicate, our power line data aligns really nicely.', 'After a visual evaluation of the True Colour images, we moved forward and started to get deeper into the vegetation status. One option we had available was a false color image depicting the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI. In the example images we have here, it‚Äôs shown in green. The brighter the green, the more vegetation there is on that pixel. In contrast to the True Colour image above, here we can easily see the location of the vegetation. A snowy winter makes the images even clearer.', 'Both these data types have their strengths and weaknesses. The negative side of NDVI images is that, for example, buildings and other features are not that clearly visible. For human eyes, we can combine the outputs and show the vegetation index as an overlay on top of True Colour image. That way we can both see the details of non-vegetation areas and the vegetation without any extra shadows.', 'The actual data analysis was done using the vegetation index. With this resolution, a single pixel in the data represents a 0.5mx0.5m area. The analysis was made by calculating the nearest pixel to a point in the power line, with vegetation value above a threshold. All segments of the powerline closer than 1m to the nearest vegetation were marked as red. A couple of examples can be seen in the images below. A higher level evaluation indicates that the analysis is useful for specific situations.', 'This kind of vegetation monitoring in the electricity distribution context can be helpful in many ways. It won‚Äôt replace all other methods, but at best it can complement them in a way that enhances fault prediction and prevention. And it does it automatically.', 'Many electricity distribution companies use helicopters to survey grid equipment. While filming the overhead wires, the helicopter can also laserscan the general area for potential vegetation problems, but this is done only every four or five years. Being able to easily get up-to-date information about the vegetation between the helicopter runs can help monitor the grid.', 'In addition to continuous monitoring, satellite data could be used in more situations that come up suddenly, like storm damage assessment. During the storm and immediately after, poor weather and tight schedules might limit data availability, making the use of satellite data difficult for acute damage spotting, but over a longer timeframe detecting emerging problems and preventing further damage might be possible, especially in hard to reach places.', 'Even without storms, there might be changes in vegetation in critical areas. Some forest owners might do some thinning or clear-cutting, but leave some trees too close to the wires, which could then be prone to falling on the powerlines. Satellite data could be used to spot potential problems like this before the actual damage occurs.', 'In 2019 a Finnish electricity distribution company had an average of 5347 kilometers of power lines. With the platform we have been using, satellite imagery for a minimum area of 25km¬≤ can be ordered for as little as $250. The area of interest can be limited to an area 100 meters wide, covering only the actual wires, so the whole electric grid could be covered for less than $6000. Smaller areas can naturally be monitored at a much lower cost, based on need.', 'Satellite data can detect vegetation and large objects well enough to be useful as an additional tool for grid monitoring, but it‚Äôs not precise enough to replace closer inspection done with helicopters or on location.', 'In our case study, comparing the results from computer-predicted problem areas with real life observations resulted in very similar results, thus proving satellite images as a viable method to provide power grid management with additional tools.', 'Automatically triggering work orders based on this data might not be the first thing to pursue at this point, but the pre-screening of areas for an operator to go through reduces the amount of busy-work. It‚Äôs a cost-efficient way to find potential problem areas.', 'Comparing pictures from previous years also makes it possible to automatically point out only the areas that have had significant changes, further lessening the need for manual work. When an area flagged as a problem by the machine is checked on-site and determined to be safe, we need to focus on it again only when something changes more or less dramatically.']",[]

So far, her journey at Futurice has taken her through three of our offices in three different countries, and taught her many valuable lessons about business, the world around her, as well as herself. In this interview, Nadia shares her story and explains why she considers Futurice an ideal setting for young professionals to grow and learn in.', 'Futurice is fertile ground for varied career journeys as well as stories of personal and professional growth. Among these journeys is that of Nadia Karolainen, a seasoned Futurice veteran who has built herself an international business career with us, and picked up an impressive array of skills and tools along the way.', 'Before joining Futurice, Nadia had worked at Fortum, a Finland-based energy company ‚Äì and a long-time Futurice client ‚Äì for six years.', 'During her time there, she pivoted from her initial procurement analyst position to a business development role that focused on innovative new services and business models.', '‚ÄúFortum was a great starting point for my career, and it gave me a much-needed understanding of how big corporations work. But I wanted an outside-of-the-box perspective to see how innovations are created and managed elsewhere,‚Äù Nadia says.', 'Nadia‚Äôs journey at Futurice started in 2016. Before that, she had already heard about Futurice through a work project, and learned more through a friend who had joined the company earlier.', '‚ÄúBy 2016, I had realized I needed a bigger change. Not knowing exactly what that change could be, I quit my job and left for an adventure through Australia and Asia for a few months with my fianc√©,‚Äù Nadia recounts.', '‚ÄúWe were still getting settled down in Singapore when that same friend of mine put me in touch with Helmut, the founder of Futurice‚Äôs brand new Munich office. It turned out they had plenty of new projects starting in Munich, and many of them had to do with the energy business.‚Äù', 'Nadia was asked aboard. The job description ticked all the relevant boxes, and the setting was refreshingly different from the corporate world she had already experienced firsthand, as well as the management consulting firms her classmates from business school had ended up in.', 'And just like that, on a week‚Äôs notice, Nadia said yes. She and her future husband set a course for Munich, and one adventure turned into another.', 'When Nadia first set foot into the newly opened Munich office, her teammates consisted of the two founders and two other employees: a software developer and a designer. The tiny, shared office space and ultra-casual vibe stood in stark contrast with her previous company, and demonstrated how big of a change she had made.', 'In addition to pivoting from the energy industry into a consultancy with touchpoints to several different industries, she had moved from a large corporation to an early-stage greenfield startup, and in the process, swapped a highly structured and process-driven culture for a life without predefined playbooks or hard-and-fast policies.', '‚ÄúOur entry and success in the market was largely driven by our pragmatic and non-hierarchical approach with a small multidisciplinary team, which was rather new in the German context, and at the same time true to our Nordic roots,‚Äù Nadia says.', '', 'Setting everything up from scratch was hard work, and Futurice had virtually zero brand awareness. The Munich team had to establish a solid client base and grow its accounts, and that involved winning tenders for massive companies, like BMW or E.ON ‚Äì but the chosen approach worked.', '‚ÄúCompared to Finland, Germany can be a pretty hierarchical and conservative business environment, and the Futurice culture and ways of working stood out and represented a new and exciting option in the boardrooms where we pitched our services,‚Äù Nadia recalls.', '‚ÄúStarting out from the deep end of the pool felt intimidating at first ‚Äì but it taught me courage and really drove home the point that when you‚Äôre going after the big fish, you need to stand out and have a strong point of view.‚Äù', 'Early on, the Munich office needed to import expertise and support from other parts of the company. One of Nadia‚Äôs responsibilities was to coordinate this and keep the newly launched satellite in close contact with the rest of Futurice.', '‚ÄúThat required getting to know a lot of people. But by far the closest connections I formed with my local colleagues in Munich. It may sound like a clich√© but we really were as close as family. I‚Äôve made some lifelong friends during my time there.‚Äù', '', 'As the office grew in headcount, its operations also grew more professional and systematic.', '‚ÄúInitially, it was everyone‚Äôs job to grow the local business and contribute to sales. As we signed more deals, we wound up with more projects in our hands as well as a growing client base ‚Äì and we had to start doing more big picture planning to fit all these together,‚Äù Nadia points out.', '‚ÄúThat meant thinking about project staffing, synergies between the clients in our portfolio, developing accounts and figuring out how everything aligned with what we wanted to do and where we wanted to be in a few years.‚Äù', 'By late 2018, the headcount of the Munich office had grown to more than 30 people. Nadia‚Äôs role had given her a good vantage point and view over the company, as well as an extensive network and plenty of exposure internally.', '‚ÄúI eventually learned about an opportunity that was about to open up at the London office. The strategy and consulting team there was looking for someone to lead and develop its local offering and figure out an ideal service-market fit, and they asked how I felt about that position,‚Äù Nadia recalls.', '', 'The request was impeccably timed. At that point, Nadia had spent just over two years driving the Munich business from startup to scaleup mode, and she had recently started to think about what she wanted to do next. That question answered itself as she took on the task and set out on the next adventure on her career journey.', 'The London office was more established than the one in Munich, and it had undergone a couple of transformations during the previous years.', '‚ÄúThe market was far more competitive and saturated with dozens of consultancies with similar portfolios and selling points. Futurice also had a very modest level of brand awareness in the UK,‚Äù Nadia says.', 'As a result, differentiating from the competition took a lot more effort than Nadia had grown used to. The team realized that they need to invest time in building, strengthening and polishing their story, and learned to adapt accordingly.', '‚ÄúWe put a lot of effort into listening to our clients and the market. We concluded that our position called for a strong focus on the fundamentals and our core offering, nothing too fancy. How you sell, pitch and plan projects or facilitate workshops matters more than a lot of people realize.‚Äù', 'For Nadia, working on adjusting the local approach was a valuable lesson in the importance of playing the long game. Solid business relationships require time, patience and commitment ‚Äì just like personal relationships.', '‚ÄúAt Futurice, one of our values is trust, and we live that value by trusting our coworkers unconditionally ‚Äì ‚Äòtrust is given, not earned,‚Äô as we like to say. But the world outside our bubble is very different. When people don‚Äôt really know your company, it can take several months or years to build the trust and reputation to close an important deal,‚Äù Nadia says.', '‚ÄúAnd the higher up you‚Äôre trying to sell, the longer it will take.‚Äù', 'For Nadia, the most precious aspect in working at the London office was the genuine collaboration between people rather than roles.', '', '‚ÄúWhenever you asked someone for an opinion, there was no compartmentalizing. People were close with their colleagues and didn‚Äôt think of each other as software engineers, designers, consultants or salespeople, for example. Instead, there were individuals ‚Äì like Mitch, Saara, and Tino and so on ‚Äì and it helped us default to cross-functional teamwork.‚Äù', 'The two years Nadia spent in London were busy on the work front, but also included an unprecedented rollercoaster ride of emotions. The absolute pinnacle came in late 2019 when she had her first child. And just a few short months later, a global pandemic turned the entire world upside down.', 'After her maternity leave, Nadia came back to a world stuck indefinitely in a remote work limbo. There were plenty of career growth and development opportunities up for grabs at the London office, but the circumstances eventually made Nadia and her family want to be closer to their relatives.', '‚ÄúWe loved London and I know I would have enjoyed working there, but at one point we decided it was time for another adventure, this time back in Finland,‚Äù Nadia says.', 'Over the years, Nadia has abandoned the traditional five-year fixed career ladder mindset. Instead, she sees her career development as a process of continuous evolution.', '‚ÄúI have a direction and goals for my career, and I think every adventure leads to a new one, teaching me things about the world ‚Äì and myself ‚Äì along the way. Professional growth comes in different forms: new skills and competencies, as well as a continuously growing toolbox that ranges from grassroots level sales and recruitment to business management.‚Äù', '', 'In her current role in Helsinki, Nadia aspires to build on top of what she has started in Munich and London. She wants to be closely involved with Futurice‚Äôs international projects, and work as a bridge-builder between the mothership of the Futurice family and its different offices.', '‚ÄúSomeone who connects people and adds value to the themes we are working on as a company. This ties well to our connected company approach, which is all about utilizing AI and data to help the right people within the company find each other. But the data-enabled push needs to be balanced with soft values and a human component.‚Äù', 'In an expert organization like Futurice, the people and the connections between them are a major part of the cultural glue that holds the entire company together. Based on Nadia‚Äôs experiences, there are some contrasts between our offices related to local cultural differences ‚Äì but at the same time, there is a strong consistency that stems from some of the traits that our people share.', '‚ÄúThings like endless curiosity towards other Futuriceans and the various competencies represented within the company, as well as the drive to create new value for our clients and to society as a whole. Wherever you are at Futurice, the people are down-to-earth and you won‚Äôt bump into big egos.‚Äù', 'The last part, Nadia says, is closely connected to another important feature you can count on at Futurice: psychological safety.', '‚ÄúAt Futurice, whatever you do, you can do it while being truly yourself. The people around you will not try to correct your demeanor or the way you speak or present yourself. You‚Äôre not forced into a mold or expected to dress in a specific way. Diversity is seen as a strength.‚Äù', '‚ÄúIf I had joined a German or a British organization in Munich or London, I‚Äôm pretty certain my adventure could have been radically different in this sense ‚Äì and many others,‚Äù Nadia concludes.', 'Read more about what we do and the great things we‚Äôve achieved together with our clients ‚Äì and when you‚Äôre ready, don‚Äôt hesitate to start your own adventure at Futurice.']",[]
https://futurice.com/blog/bridging-sectors-with-james-buxton,Bridging Sectors: Future Fleets with James Buxton,4 May 2021,Opinion,"As electric vechiles become more prevalent, fleet managers adding more EVs to their portfolio. But the transition comes with its challenges. What if the client doesn't have a charge point? How do we ease the change in customer behaviour? We sat down‚Ä¶",[],"['We recently sat down with James Buxton ‚Äì Head of Fleet at Audi UK ‚Äì to discuss energy and mobility. In this conversation, we cover what‚Äôs driving the adoption of electric vehicles as company cars, the challenges with electric rental, the partnership between fleet managers and energy providers, and more. The following is an excerpt, condensed and edited for clarity.', 'For OEMs like Audi, half the challenge is getting the product to market but the other half is the service that follows. Many have commented that for Electric Vehicle (EV) fleets services are much more relevant compared to Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs), would you say that this is accurate?', 'That‚Äôs correct because your requirements as a fleet manager to run 10 Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) within a 500 unit fleet is very different to running 450 BEVs within a 500 unit fleet. So as there‚Äôs still a learning curve from petrol to EV, we‚Äôve mainly seen a strong uptake of BEVs within a ICE and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) dominant fleet.', 'The need for better infrastructure is still extremely relevant and slowly being solved, but is currently a barrier for adoption. Interestingly, what is driving the BEV uptake is better fleet segmentation and cost-saving that comes with it.', 'The average fleet is split into management and essential vehicles. Management vehicles tend to not travel vast distances as they‚Äôre mainly used to get to and from work and meetings. This unit is the main advocate for the uptake in BEVs and they tend to charge their vehicles at home. Majority of the unit is the essential vehicles ‚Äî they tend to do 5,000+ miles a year, for them the current EV infrastructure and services can‚Äôt meet their needs.', 'What‚Äôs been the biggest driver for clients choosing EVs over hybrids and ICEs?', 'Taxation has been one of the greatest motivators. For example, among the C-segment (CEO, COO, etc) the traditional choice of a diesel, saloon company car can come to ¬£500 p/m in tax while a PHEV equivalent can come to ¬£250 p/m, but a BEV could be as low as ¬£20 p/m. So BEVs is the better option in terms of finance and additionally, is better suited to their lifestyle. We speculate that the trend would be even stronger post-pandemic as remote working has created an even better use case for BEVs.', 'The management team is a smaller percentage of a larger corporate group. What‚Äôs been the common challenges in the adoption of a full BEVs operational fleet?', 'There are a number of challenges. In this current market, the impact of policies like the Benefit in Kind tax can be a huge driver for EV adoption, but the appeal is proportional to an employee‚Äôs income tax bracket.  This may be relevant for some ‚Äòessential users‚Äô, where if you transition to an EV the reduction in Benefit in Kind tax is marginal (multiplied by 20% income tax) when compared to management user drivers (multiplied by 40% income tax). So I think there could be more policies to promote the adoption of EVs for that core, essential user fleet.', 'Does depot infrastructure have an influence on the uptake of EV fleets?', ""Depots aren‚Äôt as popular or successful for a personal car use case, but tend to work better for operational vehicles, though there‚Äôs still hurdles with that model. The best case study would be the airport car rental sector. There‚Äôs a lot of movement and shuffling of those depot cars and the challenge there is the infrastructure. You‚Äôll need at least 7KwH chargers, ideally 50+KwH if possible, this can vary from vehicle to vehicle, so already there‚Äôs an issue around what's needed for sufficient load management. But the bigger issue is also around data and connectivity to each vehicle. As a fleet manager, you need to be able to predict how much charge is needed for each returning vehicle and what vehicle is available that can best accommodate a customer‚Äôs need. Currently there isn‚Äôt a system that can manage this situation well."", 'So it‚Äôs not an easy feat developing an infrastructure for a depot style EV fleet.', 'So does that lack of data mainly impact the fleet manager or the charging service?', ""I‚Äôd say fleet managers are most impacted. It's a common issue within the logistic sector, where fleet managers are allocating the vehicles per job ‚Äî those vehicles are losing money if they aren't moving or being used. Likewise, a similar point can be made for rental or depot fleets too."", 'Do the challenges and relationship to energy providers change dramatically with domestically stationed fleet vehicles?', 'Absolutely. Ease of access becomes imperative for domestically stationed vehicles. For example, when delivering an ICE car at a client‚Äôs house, they would already be familiar with how fuelling works. But with an EV, it‚Äôs very rare that the client doesn‚Äôt need any extra services. Audi has had to enter third-party arrangements to provide a holistic service for our clients. Our service now extends to finding what charging options are available for the customer. Most OEMs have also taken this approach. It‚Äôs been a learning curve that involves multiple parameters, such as making sure changing options are present and functioning on arrival, the need for additional customer data such as location beyond just delivery and to continually ensure we can provide that service to the customer. None of these were present with domestic ICEs vehicles.', 'Has that need for adaptation been a similar change for all fleet providers?', 'Those who have been operating for longer have made better headway than others, but it is a challenge for all parties: OEMs, leasing companies and the end user and likewise, bad user experience is reflected across all parties. The vehicle provider might take the brunt of it but it does cast to all members.', 'There‚Äôs also the challenge around segmenting energy usage for business and personal which was unforeseen.', 'The solution can depend on the client‚Äôs policy. Most institutions are flexible if EVs are a small percentage of their fleet but at scale, cost can become an issue. It also creates a hurdle for adoption as customers might not want to be billed for the energy use if it can‚Äôt be segmented.', 'Is this challenge a responsibility of the fleet manager, charge installation partner or the energy provider?', ""It‚Äôs a challenge for everyone frankly. It‚Äôs a challenge for fleet managers as it's a barrier to adoption, for the end user as it makes the process more complex and for the energy company as they currently don‚Äôt have the means to segment bills between what‚Äôs used for business and personal. Audi has just entered into a trial partnership with Mina, who‚Äôs service manages the chargepoint and invoices your employer monthly automatically. We‚Äôre excited by that partnership as early customer feedback has been positive."", ""So, there are solutions starting to emerge. But from an OEM perspective, it's our job to identify stronger commercial solutions. Ideally, we would like to support the full scope of the customer experience, from a wall charging setup to on-the-go charging as it‚Äôll drastically lower the barrier of entry."", 'Do you envision that these gaps in function and solutions will be filled by startups and other companies or the traditional operators like OEMs and energy providers?', 'The current outlook is that other companies will be bridging the gaps. OEMs are working on solutions but the market leans towards more digital-native and agile companies to partner with in order to unlock the greater benefits and increase the level of adoption. And this applies to all members in this ecosystem.', 'From an OEM perspective, what are the opportunities and challenges you believe energy providers should focus on?', ""One challenge that I speculate will continue is the customers access to in-journey charging. At the moment that market is quite fragmented. There are numerous, different charging infrastructures across the country.  With ICE vehicles, fleet users have fuel cards which work with 99.9% of providers and it‚Äôs easy for a client to set parameters if needed. But from a charging perspective, there are numerous tariff rates that can vary widely. Plus, as we are still in the innovation phase of EVs, there isn't a protocol that‚Äôs satisfied by 99% of the charging points in the UK. That creates a lot of friction for fleet managers as they can have a variety of cars with varied invoices making the overall operational cost hard to manage and predict."", 'Outside of the challenges, what are other opportunities between fleets and energy providers that you feel haven‚Äôt been fully realised?', 'As mentioned, there is an area for improvement around the billing and energy accountability. But aside from that, there‚Äôs a requirement for the fleet and energy sector to collaborate and better manage energy peaks. In a depot situation, for example, we could have hundreds of vehicles just sitting there on a Sunday that could contribute back to the grid. With sufficient collaboration it would solve both the grid management issue for energy providers and lower the cost of operation for fleet managers therefore building a stronger case for the adoption of EVs.', 'Could a similar use case be applied for a domestic fleet?', 'I can see it being an option for the future but currently it‚Äôs not available. I would expect that it would also come with a policy rewrite but there‚Äôs little to no energy accountability which makes it hard to manage such a solution. Though ideally, fleet EVs would be used as a home battery, similar to a Tesla Powerwall. If paired with domestic solar panels, a client‚Äôs energy bill would drastically reduce, building yet another case for EV adoption.', 'What technologies have you seen that are leading these opportunities? Would bi-directional charging be one?', 'Currently, there‚Äôs very little on the market. But there are interesting developments happening, both from OEMs and energy companies as it‚Äôs a potential solution to minimise stress on the grid. Plus there‚Äôs a revenue case for both parties. For OEMs, it adds value to an EV as it becomes more than a means of transport‚Äîit could be a power generator for your house, saving your money on bills or an emergency or external power in times of need. While for energy providers, they can diversify energy production, making the grid as a whole much more resilient and could be a transfer to a more sustainable model.', 'Both can gain a new means of benefits in bridging the gap between each other and I can imagine that the data to be gained adds value to the proposition too.', 'That concludes our conversation with James Buxton.

https://futurice.com/blog/bridging-sectors-imogen-pierce,Bridging Sectors: Community and Mobility with Imogen Pierce,27 Apr 2021,Opinion,Explore how cities approach electrification at the scale of public transportation and commercial vehicle fleets,[],"['We recently spoke with Imogen Pierce ‚Äì Head of City Integration at Arrival, a global electric transport manufacturer based in London. In this conversation, we explored how cities approach electrification at the scale of public transportation and commercial vehicle fleets. The following is an excerpt, condensed and edited for clarity.', 'From a mobility provider perspective, what drives cities to consider an electric commercial/transport solution like Arrival? What are the motivating factors?', ""Cities want to deliver on their sustainability plans, but beyond sustainability, they are thinking about resiliency. So are asking, how they can reduce any kind of impact caused by drastic changes, such as extreme weather patterns? How to improve income distribution during situations like global pandemics? All of which of course can't exactly be predicted but we can minimise the effects by laying out resiliency strategies."", ""There's also an acute awareness that sustainability solutions can not be handled by a singular activity, led by one division. It requires a completely holistic view of how a city works, and the problems attached to it. Therefore, there‚Äôs a need for strong public-private partnerships with energy suppliers, mobility providers, data management platforms for smart cities, and urban planners. All of those functions need to come together and forge collaborative plans for maximum benefit. It‚Äôs really a team effort."", 'With team effort comes a distribution of challenges. What are some of the key challenges that cities need to focus on in order to adequately facilitate the adoption of technology?', ""A lot of cities will use discrete pilot projects as a way of stress testing technology - and there‚Äôs huge value in doing so - but I think it's important to ensure that the pilot project is as relevant as possible to the most number of people."", ""Second is seeing projects not just as something to be done (for example, making sure that there are public charging stations and electric public transit) but actually ensuring that it's being deployed in a way that addresses key indexes such as the environmental impact, especially in an area with high pollution. That's something a city could understand through their census data, we can understand it from our telemetry data, and energy companies can understand that from their ‚Äòenergy distribution to volume requirements‚Äô data. So there are loads of data points that we can all use to inform deployment, as well as collectively agreeing on how to prioritise different deployments."", 'How do you define relevance and value in pilot projects?', 'There is no singular answer for this but when we think about smart cities, we often think about things like smart bins or smart traffic lights. And though those things are valuable, they can only be truly valuable if they are scalable and easily deployable. So it‚Äôs important to set the expectations at the beginning of each project, to know if or when it will work. That should inform if it‚Äôs scalable or if it‚Äôs part of a series of stepping stones to a broader ecosystem of smart, connected technology. With that methodology, you can also identify things like which partners you might need to be involved for achieving the vision and the path to take.', 'Are there differences between partners used for a feasibility test versus a full implementation to scale?', 'Discrete pilot projects, where you‚Äôre just stress-testing a component, can largely be done independently, without government or a local body, and sometimes they can involve technology partners. But when it goes to the next phase, where you‚Äôre trying to identify how the product connects to the wider ecosystem, then you need a government to be a major stakeholder', 'In situations where you have a government partner aligned on the vision, do they have an active engagement in the project?', 'Absolutely. Public-private partnerships are an area where no one has fully scoped out the terms and conditions, as it has so many unique factors. So for example, with Arrival, we signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the city of Charlotte (North Carolina, USA) and here is an understanding that it‚Äôs a collaborative effort to reach resilient, future proof solutions.', 'Have you gathered any key learnings from engaging with cities or is it still early days?', ""It‚Äôs a little too early to tell. We're currently working on engaging stakeholders and establishing roadmaps. From each of these objectives, we can build a vision of how we get to the end state."", 'Thinking about vehicle manufacturers, what are the opportunities you‚Äôre seeing emerge from the sector? What are your current perceptions of the industry?', ""One of Arrival‚Äôs unique selling points (USPs) that we hope is class-leading - beyond building vehicles - is our decentralised approach to manufacturing.  We can create pockets of economic opportunity within a region by having a dedicated factory, which would both support the supply chain within that region and help shape the mobility services and vehicles available for that region; therefore you're creating the best fit-for-purpose jobs and products. It also creates better engagement with cities, which is something we are proud of."", 'In the past, cities would work with a bus manufacturer to provide transportation, but the trend seems to be that cities will have to collaborate with both mobility and energy providers to jointly deliver both a product and service. Are those the main players in this new relationship with cities?', 'Yes, currently this is the case, but ownership and accountability play an interesting aspect in the partnership. When a city is interested in electrifying its public transportation, it might have to consider the transit routes. They can either reassess the routes all together, or optimise them collectively, from a state of charge management perspective, as they know the commuting patterns. Change of state opens up the questions such as who owns that modelling and optimization, which evidently leads to asking how do we share data between us and what are the political/regulatory ramifications of that. So, for example, our vehicles create loads of data and normally that‚Äôs owned by the operator. But one could argue that both the operator and provider should provide that data to the city, and should we also provide that data to the utility company so they can do better grid balancing and what are the legal implications to this level of data sharing?', 'We could go one level further, as affecting how people move within a city falls under the urban planning departments and others, like housing and workplace distribution councils. And so they will need to become part of the conversation too. So in short, yes cities are part of the relationship, but from a modern transportation perspective, it also requires urban planning, utility companies and other players.', 'Since urban planning is centred on long term strategies and requires more deliberation for transformation, how much is a mobility provider part of that conversation?', 'It varies from case to case. The key is about establishing where we can add the most value. A charge point operator might want to build in an area where they will see the most revenue or where has the most EVs, but that might cause an increase in congestion for the urban planner. We might want to electrify a route because it‚Äôll minimise air pollution but maybe a charge point operator can‚Äôt deploy there because of its infrastructure requirements. So there is a lot of collaboration needed to make it work but the key is to involve all the right partners at an early stage.', 'More often than not public transport can be a less profitable enterprise when compared to it‚Äôs a private-sector counterpart. Do mobility providers have to diversify their revenue stream when working in the public transport space?', ""A mobility provider's value is not limited to the vehicle they offer. For example, we have these advertising screens around the top of our buses. Though buses don't generate a vast amount of advertising revenue, they can provide those media companies with location-based data, adding value through context or triggers such as weather. We can make a much more interesting platform for advertisers, creating additional revenue income for operators as well. So the conversation actually is about how to do we minimise the cost of ownership and increase potential revenue for the operators, which in the end increases the adoption of electric fleets. At Arrival, we look at mobility more broadly. We have been looking at equitable mobility options as well as how to reduce the cost of owning and operating buses."", 'On the topic of optimising value, what are your thoughts on dynamic routes, on-demand services or flexible routing as an avenue for a digitalised mobility system?', 'The data that we get from telemetry is really valuable because you can get better information on states of charge such as how energy is impacted by congestion, the volume of and type of passengers ‚Äî this can then be used to better optimise the system.We then have this incredible wealth of data to inform other choices like bus routes, improving economic opportunity for communities, and what kind of service to offer such as direct routes or multi-modal journeys. From a personal perspective, I‚Äôm interested to see how taxis or ride-hailing will work in harmony with public transit, and the data partnership between a private and public operator.', 'On the topic of on-demand or responsive routes, Milton Keynes has recently announced that they have removed all of the public-operated fixed routes in exchange for an on-demand responsive service. That will be an interesting one to follow.', 'Although, dynamic routing is hard to define for the passenger. Does it fall under a smart taxi solution or a modernised shuttle type service or just a more efficient way to operate public transport? They can be very different experiences. How you travel does impact your perception of the journey.', 'Grid balancing has been an on-going topic as energy and mobility merge. What is your perspective on the topic and does it impact your industry?', 'We know that the challenge is very different between the US and the UK. In the UK, we have challenges around where to appropriately station fleets and the cost of upgrading the grid. whereas in the US, we have challenges around regulation and grid resiliency. But in terms of balancing the grid, I think we need to collectively get a better understanding of fleet usage and challenge the belief that we need to always charge every vehicle to full capacity.', 'From that, we can have smarter solutions. For example, a van driver who only does 40 miles a day, could change his display so that the meter shows 60 miles worth of charge rather than charging it to its full capacity. That small behaviour change can have a huge impact at scale.', 'Though range anxiety is less of an issue, it can still be a barrier for adoption, especially when budgets are tight and EVs are less familiar, but it can easily be addressed with clever solution thinking. For example with school buses. Instead of having two busses, with one for shorter routes and one for longer routes, you could balance the charge for both by having one do the longer route in the morning and the shorter route in the afternoon and vice versa.', ""So in short, we know that behavioural changes could reduce an enormous amount of pressure on the grid, But to be most efficient, we need to truly understand people's emotional behaviours and their fleet usage patterns better as well."", 'Vehicle to Grid (V2G) is a big topic in the energy and mobility field. Do you foresee bus depots as operating as an energy or storage hub in order to better manage the grid?', ""I think it‚Äôs inevitable. We're going to need a mobile relief service as well. Consider what happened in the recent Texas snowstorm disaster: a vast number of people were just left without power. Imagine what electric vehicle batteries and electric charging hubs could have done in that situation to help the community. Moments like those highlight the need to upgrade the infrastructure, and the need to do so quickly."", 'That concludes our conversation with Imogen Pierce. You can follow her on Linkedin.

That is why we created Exponential, a program to drive Futurice to become more data-driven. The Exponential Program has solved Futurice's and clients' disconnections of knowledge and the flow of work with data & AI."", 'One of the recent experiments is called Futucortex, a search engine for tapping into collective organizational knowledge. It enhances work efficiency by improving access to knowledge, finding previous work, and connecting with the right persons within an organization. Now, our Data Scientist Niklas Nevalainen and Lead Designer Numan Shakil, who worked together in designing the solution, share their experiences.', '‚ÄúEverything starts with defining a concrete problem that needs to be solved. Otherwise, it‚Äôs impossible for the data scientists and designers to concentrate on resolving the pain points of the end-users, be it improving the user experience by easing user‚Äôs cognitive load, or designing meaningful interactions. Ideally, different competencies should be involved from the early stages of the project. For instance, problem definition and involvement should continue throughout the whole product cycle‚Äù, Numan says.', '‚ÄúThis is my first time working very closely with a designer‚Äù, Niklas continues. ‚ÄúIt took time for us to understand each other‚Äôs roles as a data scientist and designer, and why both are equally important in reaching the goal: customer and user expectations are met with design thinking, and development stems from data competence. We were always sharing ideas within the team and people were so eager to listen and develop them together. It‚Äôs been fun. Sometimes I just couldn‚Äôt wait to get to experiment a new concept or share a new idea with the team. There were things that I thought to be trivial, simple or small, but as Numan started working on them, I was impressed.‚Äù', 'Data helps shape the design of a product. Similarly, design helps make the data more understandable and digestible for the end users, which automatically increases product\'s value. ""For a designer, data provides another layer of information to draw from. It allows you to provide more explainability, relevance, and context to the users, which helps improve the overall product experience. The way a data scientist sees and approaches data in comparison to my role as a designer is quite unique. Assimilating how Niklas was making decisions during his work and how those decisions would condition my work as a designer has been quite valuable"", mentions Numan.', 'Niklas & Numan agree on the importance of a common language, because success depends on good communication in agile projects. All the team members should work together, just like a rowing team going towards a common goal, with everyone providing their input. Most importantly, a curious mindset and culture of openness enable our data scientists and designers to think from another perspective and challenge each other. In an environment such as Exponential, these things come naturally as part of the experimentation. Because there are no predefined processes on how the designers and data scientists work together, we came up with one.', '', 'The core part of the Futucortex concepting was aligning the user‚Äôs wishes and needs with the correct algorithm. To improve the relevance of search results, our team closely collaborated and studied the past user-generated search queries, which helped identify the two major search approaches:', ""We established the vital categories that included names, dates, sites, client names, content types, formats, industries, competencies, and keywords based on examples of the search queries and the two leading search approaches. As we identified the initial key categories, the algorithm started to shape up in a manner that could work for the both search approaches we had identified. We've also prepared visuals to show how these algorithms were done together."", '', '', 'Similarly, the collaboration between data and design also added value to the tangible parts of the Futucortex experience. We learned that often the file names alone do not provide enough context for the users. To improve this, we‚Äôve used machine learning to extract metadata such as info tags, dates, and key persons from multiple data sources, including Google Drive, Power (Futurice‚Äôs own ERP), Planmill, Slack, and calendar meetings, to name a few. Machine learning was also used to auto-generate a summary for the documents and create a ranking logic to show the most relevant keywords. Metadata provided the users with necessary context to judge the relevance of the results for their specific needs.', '', 'Within this project, the design and data science collaboration started to interweave early on.

https://futurice.com/blog/bridging-sectors-with-jacqui-murray,Bridging Sectors: A Look at Battery Solutions for Mobility with Jacqui Murray,21 Apr 2021,Opinion,"As the energy and mobility sectors intersect, the hunt for improved battery solutions widens. We sat down with Jacqui Murray ‚Äì Deputy Challenge Director of Faraday Battery Challenge at Innovate UK ‚Äì to discuss the future of battery technology and how‚Ä¶",[],"['We recently spoke with Jacqui Murray ‚Äì Deputy Challenge Director for the Faraday Battery Challenge at Innovate UK ‚Äì to discuss batteries, research and innovation. In this conversation, we explored how the UK is facilitating the future of battery technology.', 'You describe one pillar of the Faraday Battery Challenge, the Faraday Institution as a ‚Äúvirtual Institution,‚Äù where teams of University Researchers can answer questions posed by industry, not just academically-focused topics. Could you expand on this?', 'Faraday uses an application-led model of doing research within universities. The virtual aspect refers to a head office with about 15 people, plus our wider team made up of 450 researchers throughout universities in the UK, all working on solving the problems issued by the industry. Typically science funding is allocated to everything from blue-sky thinking to practical applications, but often it‚Äôs not all cohesive. Our model at Faraday is to bring together those isolated pockets of academic thinking and create a ‚ÄúTeam UK‚Äù approach.', 'We also have our collaborative R&D pillar, a group made up of academics, enterprises, SME, and scaling start-ups. Again, collaboration is key to success for these groups because solutions and innovation is not a linear process. You can discover the best cell chemistry but it‚Äôs another challenge to develop a functioning prototype and an even bigger challenge to bring that to market. Manufacturing cells must be done at scale and pace to bring down costs and improve quality. You need a thriving community of high technology businesses across the country developing substantially new Lithium-Ion battery technologies with greater performance, along with new solutions that have the potential for a globally significant breakthrough in performance, weight and cost. It‚Äôs essential for these partners to work together.', 'And finally, we have our UK Battery Industrialization Centre - our commercialisation pillar, a ¬£130 million facility where the industry can bring prototypes and products to life at scale. It‚Äôs open and flexible, so you can work confidentially as a single company, or partner up with collaborators (e.g. battery companies and vehicle companies). Our partners work on everything from full battery and vehicle builds to individual component prototypes. This open and flexible industrialisation model has really pushed the UK ahead in this field; we‚Äôre the first in Europe to have this type of facility.', 'So in the end, while the Faraday Battery Challenge has the virtual Faraday Institution, every delivery pillar has very tangible outcomes for British industry. Ultimately it‚Äôs about connecting partners across the UK and providing them with the capacity and capability to innovate on battery technology.', 'Have you seen any trends or changes over the past three years of operation, in the questions asked by the industry? How has the UK advanced in its readiness to be more electric?', 'There have been massive changes. We recently evaluated our innovation spending and we‚Äôve seen a step-change in technology readiness levels. We‚Äôre seeing companies scale and shift from technology development to actually commercially supplying their products. Of course, this takes significant capital and patience, and we‚Äôre seeing more and more interest from investors.', 'From a materials point of view, we‚Äôve seen the conversation change as well. For example, cobalt has traditionally had an issue with its credentials, stemming from the negative social and environmental impact it‚Äôs had on some of the countries where it‚Äôs mined. Now, as a programme, we‚Äôre looking at how we can support the world better. Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) plays a fundamental part in R&D, and we continually analyse and compare our solutions to other options, be it petrol-diesel or other battery technology. We have to make sure we deliver solutions that don‚Äôt just hit technical product targets but also are socially and ecologically sustainable as well. We are already seeing trends to low cobalt batteries due to supply chain concerns.', 'It sounds like the process of getting products to market is picking up speed. What‚Äôs driving this acceleration? ', 'It‚Äôs amazing - we‚Äôre now seeing AI accelerate the battery R&D process. For example, a key challenge to battery development is material selection - you have this incredible array of tools you can put into batteries, but where‚Äôs the best place to start? So we ran an event on this topic, which resulted in the MAT2BAT project, an AI system that can analyse what type of batteries are most likely to be best for different applications, which then informs what materials are the best candidates to start researching. This cuts down research and development time significantly, by leveraging the UK‚Äôs strength in AI and high-performance computing.', 'Have you seen any trends in the electric vehicle (EV) space, specifically?', 'Well, there has always been a focus on solving range anxiety, but the miles per kilowatt-hour that vehicles are delivering now has hugely improved since just a year or two ago - meaning less electricity needed for every mile you drive. What‚Äôs more, we‚Äôve seen improvements in the sustainability front as well. When you look at the lifecycle impact of EVs now, in terms of how they compete with existing internal combustion engines and their entire supply chain, the figures can be phenomenal. They absolutely destroy it where there is a green electricity grid. And so, with both the improvements in EV infrastructure and EV battery technology, you see a shift in the consumer‚Äôs demand for EVs. Now electrification is expanding into the high-end vehicle space - it‚Äôs a real maturing of the industry.', 'So has the impact mainly been around the automotive industry?', 'No, it‚Äôs the entire supply chain. There‚Äôs a ¬£4.8 billion opportunity for chemical companies in the UK. We‚Äôve been working with The Society of Chemical Industry, as well as joining up partnerships with companies like 3M. The UK is certainly the right place for it, as many of the leading companies are already here.', 'So outside of Faraday, what are some cross-sector collaborations that you think are essential for the integration of this type of technology moving forward?', ""It's not just the tech that needs to move forward, it's also the services, the business models, the systems and more. We have to catch up to 120 years of internal combustion engines, and that includes regulations, safety development, and environmental guidance. There is a lot currently in play but it‚Äôs in a very complex system ‚Äî so for me, it‚Äôs looking at how we can improve our life cycle so that the life of each battery is fully optimised, in all aspects, from environmental impact to safety. And there are untested questions like how do we use technologies such as blockchain? A distributed ledger could, for example, create an agreement between the cell manufacturer and the battery recycler, so that the dismantler could access the necessary information, therefore allowing them to invest in the most efficient technology for recycling. The depths of complexity that we're dealing with need almost everything to change."", 'What are the changes in economic systems that are influencing industry the most?', 'There are two major ones in the UK. Firstly, Brexit and the Rules of Origin. In order to meet the anticipated global demand for EV batteries, production needs to increase significantly worldwide, including in the UK and Europe. A battery represents around a third of the total value of an electric vehicle. If the cells were imported and only the modules and packs assembled in the UK, only about 20% of the value of the battery would be captured locally in terms of jobs, value-add etc. If the cells are made here, that increases to 45%, and if the upstream chemicals are processed here then the value to the UK is 80%+, estimated to be worth up to ¬£9bn by 2035.', 'Additionally, the Trade & Cooperation Agreement (TCA) between the UK and the EU has recently introduced Rules of Origin requirements that need to be adhered to in order to avoid tariffs on trade between the two markets. Here the regulations stipulate a maximum amount of value in the finished product that does not originate from the UK or EU. By 2026, this will effectively mean that any Electric Vehicles traded between the two blocks will need to have the battery cells and the active cathode material manufactured either in the UK or EU. Clearly, we want as much as possible in the UK.', 'Confidence in investments is key. Bringing the uncertainty surrounding the UK future trading relationship with the EU to an end has been hugely positive. The announcement by Nissan confirming the future of Sunderland as a long-term centre for EV production was a direct result of the clarity provided by the TCA.', 'We have since seen very significant announcements from Jaguar Land Rover and Ford and further signals regarding Gigafactory sites. Although the Rules of Origin requirements described earlier do put the UK in a straight race with the EU, there is plenty of reason for optimism. The total UK/EU market will be vast, and in the case of Internal Combustion Engines, over the years the UK has captured much more than its fair share (2.6m units pa) of UK/EU volumes through leadership in technology and innovation.', 'Secondly, ESG is becoming increasingly important, both from a social and environmental context and for brand alignment. You‚Äôll recall the public outcry around Apple and the mobile phone industry because of the slavery used for mining or rare earth materials. The growing sensitivity around accountability in the supply chain is pivoting the market. And as the market pivots, sustainability is being woven into more and more touchpoints. Volvo recently announced leather-free options in their latest models. It‚Äôs great to see that, especially as an ex Environmental Regulator.', 'One interesting way to look at EVs is ‚Äòbatteries on wheels‚Äô. When Texas was hit with the recent snowstorm, we saw Ford EV truck batteries being used to power home essentials. So it changes the profile of EVs from energy consumption devices to potentially energy storage and providers, as well. Have you seen any activity around this new use case?', ""That topic is fascinating because it really opens the conversation around energy infrastructure and a two-way energy exchange. We work closely with the National Grid and have their Chief Engineer, David Wright on our advisory group. He often speaks on the long-term strategy of the UK grid, how many renewable options are coming online, grid storage, and how they're going to manage all that. Within that is the concept of a more distributed energy network. Some of the issues he anticipates we will face in the UK is the demand that will be put on old technology - such as 1950‚Äôs transformers - as they power a neighbourhood. A possible solution would be the vehicle to grid (V2G) idea, which would create a micro-grid to support your home and your neighbour‚Äôs house rather than the National Grid. We also have solutions such as Tesla using second-life batteries as a battery box for your house and a connected grid of solar panels. The concept of a micro-grid has been instrumental in places like Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America where their macro grid isn‚Äôt as well constructed as the UK because of distances between energy generators and homes. But they can use their own energy generation platforms like solar, wind or hydro to power their community."", ""But to return to EV as batteries, I think people underestimate the power of stored energy. It isn't like a slightly bigger 12-volt lead-acid battery. The entrained energy in EV‚Äôs is much larger, so yes you can power a house during peak demand times easily.  Though it‚Äôs worth adding that we are still in the infancy of building the infrastructure needed to fully utilise a V2G model."", 'How do you balance business, consumer, and environmental value in some of the initiatives you are supporting?', ""No one can accurately answer what type of batteries or solutions will solve climate change and energy issues in the long-term. What we can do, is own this complex problem and build the solutions of tomorrow with our industries that will support both our country's prosperity and also help our learning of electrification as new technologies are discovered, developed and deployed."", 'In the Faraday Battery Challenge, we conduct research into lithium-ion developments and next-generation technologies such as solid-state batteries, lithium sulphur batteries and more. From the research, you can deliver answers like: how to enable fast charging, what is the best cell chemistry, and how can we optimise current technology to be more resilient. As we are open to and focused on those questions, we can get a clearer view of future technologies. In the UK, we‚Äôre building a superpower through a world-class science base, the creation of an ecosystem of ambitious scaling companies and pivoting large companies that are all collaborating to build the future.', 'The future of innovation is always difficult to predict and that‚Äôs part of the Faraday Battery Challenge -  we get an early peek into what the future holds.', 'Looking ahead, what innovations and opportunities are you excited to see in the next 2-3 years as mobility and energy merge?', 'As a materials engineer, the use of AI in R&D is exciting. We‚Äôve seen examples of it in the pharmaceutical industry, with the use of AI to help streamline the research phase of molecule composition. I can see it being used for battery chemistry research, answering topics like whether solid-state is better than lithium-sulphur. I anticipate it will help us choose what to focus on and create a more efficient roadmap.', 'I‚Äôm also fascinated by the material side of batteries, understanding what‚Äôs going on at an atomic level, material degradation and looking at concepts like using silicon anodes (because you need four carbon atoms to intercalate a lithium-ion, whereas with silicon you can use six but structurally it expands, which so you need to reinforce the crystalline structure).', 'There‚Äôs also all the high-level questions to solve. As you mentioned, building a V2G infrastructure, what we can do with second-life batteries and improving the life of a vehicle.  I think one of the most immediate opportunities is the recycling industry in the UK ‚Äî we‚Äôre increasing efforts to understand what we can do to recycle and reuse batteries.', 'Cost for consumers is really important too.  This is where sodium ion, for example, is really exciting. Take India as a case study - sodium-ion batteries could be placed into every scooter and micro-mobility vehicle. That‚Äôll be interesting to watch.', 'That concludes our conversation with Jacqui Murray. You can follow her on LinkedIn.

One started with brunch & bubbly, another one with me having to assemble a desk so that I‚Äôd have somewhere to work. Onboarding plays a crucial role in welcoming new employees and helping them start their journey at your company on a positive note. ', 'It also ensures more consistent services for clients and helps in team building. In a network organisation like Futurice, the social aspect of onboarding is even more critical, as our social capital is the capital that the company has. Remote times make onboarding more challenging: the feeling of community is harder to achieve, and there‚Äôs less room for last-minute changes when we‚Äôre limited to online communication.', 'Still, my first weeks at Futurice have been great.', 'Based on my experiences over the last weeks, here are some very practical (and some philosophical) tips for how to make remote onboarding and onboarding, in general, a delightful experience for a newbie.', 'I‚Äôve onboarded at Futurice twice: as an intern and as a full-timer. I love some things about it, and many will work when we return to the office, too.', 'Continuing from the values, the simple fact that the company culture and topics like DE&I are an overarching theme in the onboarding and not just a mention on the final slide of another presentation speaks volumes about their importance. For example, we went through difficult topics such as equity and psychological safety with discussion and real-life examples. Like said, social capital is the capital here, so supporting the way we build social relationships and interaction makes sense.', 'Furthermore, having a well-planned and organised onboarding process means that the presentations link together, reference to the same strategic objectives, values and mission statements. The cognitive load required of a newbie is always a big one, but making sure that the presenters know and understand each others‚Äô topics can help make sure that it doesn‚Äôt get overwhelming. If there‚Äôs repetition, it‚Äôs intentional.', 'One structure that I‚Äôd like to highlight is the Futubuddy, a separate support person that the newbie is introduced to on their first day. The Futubuddy helps with practicalities, such as using different software and becoming a part of the community. We all have supervisors, opportunities to get a mentor, our own tribes, and competence groups, but having a designated Someone unrelated to one‚Äôs performance as an employee can make a big difference in having the courage to ask the right questions. So far, my Futubuddy has:', ""Onboarding, as any people practice in organisations, is always a work in progress. Whether you and your colleagues are face to face or sitting at your living room sofas, it‚Äôs good to think about the goals you‚Äôre trying to achieve with the onboarding process and ask for feedback to validate whether it's working. Less surprisingly, that too is done well here at Futurice. Like any people operations professional knows, great onboarding - no matter if remote or face to face - makes a difference, as first impressions are (usually) only made once"", ""Do you want to experience this onboarding firsthand? Check out our careers page and consider applying for a job. And if you'd like to work remotely, but stay close to the action, checkout our Remote Openings for Finland.""]","['Ensure that the essentials are there: a computer, a schedule of the first day(s), and a number to call if something unexpected happens. A simple checklist helps ensure that these are delivered. I picked up my new laptop from the parcel locker in the convenience store next door, received a detailed schedule for the first three days in the email the previous week, and was reassured that the Human Care team would help me with any questions I might have.', 'Always keep the video turned on for video calls. I‚Äôve always been an advocate for using video, but especially now that the only way of interpreting others‚Äô reactions is through video; seeing others in the room makes you feel safer and more comfortable. Most of the interaction during the first three days was through Google Meets, which meant that that‚Äôs where I met my new colleagues, fellow newbies and instructors.', 'Make sure your onboarding is in line with your company‚Äôs values. Seeing the company values everywhere in a concrete fashion makes me happy. Futurice is known for its great culture, but I was still impressed by how every presentation or workshop we took part in reflected care, trust, transparency and continuous improvement. As remote work can reduce interactions the newbies have, extra effort is needed to help them believe and internalise the values. For example, the tips listed above reflect care very well, showing us through the newest financial statements shows the trust and transparency, and helping us start on our growth plans already on day two communicates the idea of continuous improvement concretely.', 'Automate the humdrum stuff. Digital solutions such as the Donut app on Slack can help you there. It‚Äôs an automatic reminder that nudges the newbie in Slack once a day to remind them about sending their tax card to the payroll, reading a helpful article on the intranet or checking out a fun Slack channel. It‚Äôs good to have the reminder where it counts: as a more significant portion of the communications happens on Slack than face to face, it becomes a more valuable channel for the reminders.', 'Finally, and perhaps surprisingly, remote onboarding also creates new opportunities. A major one is the ease of meeting people. A newbie can just jump on a video call with a colleague for 20 minutes to get to know each other, no matter where they‚Äôre based or whether they work at the client‚Äôs or not. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve created a personal project called The Great Networking Challenge of 2021, a semi-serious gamification of growing my network at the company with the help of an Excel sheet and an in-house app called BubbleBurster that helps by suggesting people who know about Swedish, NoSQL or D&I, for example.', 'walked me through the specifics of hour logging,', 'discussed their projects with me to give perspective on my future work,', 'given me tips about where to buy the best plants around here,', 'been an all-around nice and reliable person.']"

Through experimenting with data portraits I learned how data can enrich even such a simple form of communication, and untap previously unseen potential.', 'When was the last time you mailed someone a postcard?', 'If you‚Äôre anything like me, it‚Äôs probably been quite a while. But don‚Äôt we all love receiving postcards? Hand-picked by the sender, often with cheesy imagery on the front, but most importantly, with a handwritten note on the back. It‚Äôs a heartwarmingly personal feeling and ‚Äì being stuck between social distancing and Zoom fatigue ‚Äì one I seem to miss more than ever.', 'To navigate this physically distant time, we were looking for a quirky, personal way to engage with our local business contacts in Sweden. As most companies around us seemed to be competing over people‚Äôs attention during their screen time, we sensed that it might be a good time to go offline instead.', 'When the idea of sending out personal, handwritten notes on postcards eventually popped up, everything just clicked. Possibly related to the fact that Swedes seem to be secretly bonkers about postcards ‚Äì at 14.5 million cards per year, Sweden is actually the biggest postcard producer in the EU, accounting for 24% of the total postcard production in Europe (Eurostat, 2021).', 'However, simply sending out plain, store-bought postcards did not feel right, and neither did sending out a brand-colored postcard with a simple logo print. We wanted this to be a more innovative, meaningful and personal experience, and at the same time, something that would combine our core competencies of data, design and technology. So we started experimenting with ideas that could make the postcard reflect the sender‚Äôs personality, or establish a stronger personal connection between sender and receiver overall. In the end, this led us to the concept of data portraits.', 'At its core, a data portrait is an artwork that depicts data accumulated about a person ‚Äì rather than their face as seen in classical portraits (Donath et al., 2010). Our idea was to turn the motif featured on the front of the postcard into a data portrait of its sender.', 'This way, the cards would present the recipient with easily interpretable information about the sender that goes beyond their face. Besides its visual appeal, the design enables the recipient to discover unexpected facts about the sender and identify things they have in common with them. Not only a nice conversation starter the next time they‚Äôre in touch, but maybe the starting point for a stronger personal relationship between the two. Think of it as the data-enabled 21st century equivalent of personalized letterhead.', 'The foundation of our data portraits was set by defining the data the cards would eventually depict, and gathering that data. Our team came up with a questionnaire consisting of nine simple questions:', 'At this stage, we focused particularly on gathering information on the subject‚Äôs professional profile and ways of working. The actual data collection was done through a digital questionnaire where each sender would enter their answers in just a couple of minutes.', 'In order to depict the responses in a comprehensible manner, we came up with an intriguing visual design that established graphical metaphors and analogies to represent the data. This ranged from transforming their name into a personal background pattern, to mimicking an analog clock that illustrates the subject‚Äôs most creative time of the day, or finding abstract shapes to reflect their favorite fika (Swedish coffee break) snack.', '\nQuestionnaire with visual translation of its answers.', 'Rather than creating each individual design manually, we wrote a custom piece of code to handle this part of the process for us. By using Processing, an open source software sketchbook, we were able to create, adjust and manipulate the graphic elements incorporated in a data portrait based on the individual responses.', 'In the end, creating data portraits for an entire team became as simple as moving a .CSV file with the questionnaire responses into a dedicated folder, and executing the code ‚Äì conveniently leaving me time for a fika while my computer did all the heavy lifting of creating and exporting the final designs.', 'Putting it all together, this is how our data portraits turned out:', '\nSelected Data Portraits of our Stockholm team.', 'To get the postcards ready for printing, we added a brief explanatory design to go on the back of the cards before passing them onto our local Swedish printing partner Arkitektkopia. The physical cards ‚Äì fresh off the press ‚Äì were then distributed to our employees‚Äô home offices. After adding a personal note, our Futuriceans simply needed to drop their cards into the nearest mailbox to get them on their way.', '\nArkitektkopia cutting the printed postcards.', '\nStacking the final Data Portrait postcards.', 'This little side project is a perfect example of how a design job can quickly grow into a journey that‚Äôs much larger than the sum of its parts. Over the course of this process, the seemingly simple task at hand unfolded into a much larger ‚Äì and more meaningful ‚Äì experience than any of us had anticipated.', 'It is also a great way to showcase how data and tech can help generate additional value to extremely traditional channels like print media when implemented in a clever way. This was a lesson we were proud to learn together with our printing partner Arkitektkopia who supported us in transforming our digital data portraits into gorgeous postcards made of eco-friendly paper.', 'Long live traditional print media ‚Äì augmented with digital finesse!', 'Besides sparking joy and excitement at our clients and business partners, the data portraits turned out to be great conversation starters even within our own company.

For over a year before that, I had been playing with the idea of it but it took me all the way until the end of 2020 to get started. Rust is an interesting language for me, as I have mostly programmed with languages like Python and Javascript. Rust is something quite different and from the outside looking in, its community looked great as well.', ""After my initial steps with the language where I was solving Advent of Code puzzles, I decided to build my first software with Rust. I'm an active command-line user so for me the obvious first choice was building a CLI tool. Hence, on a dark wintery Friday evening, I started working on a hobby project that would become 235."", '', ""For the small subset of readers who live in Finland and have been fans of the National Hockey League (NHL) for a long time, the number 235 rings a bell. For decades, the Finnish broadcasting company Yle has provided NHL results on their teletext service on the page 235. For me, and many others like me, it's a habit to start every day by checking the page 235 to see the results of previous night's games."", 'Inspired by this cultural phenomenon, I decided to build a tool that combined the minimalist and iconic style of that teletext page with data from an API for NHL results.', ""235 is my first Rust program and it provided me a great opportunity to learn a new language ‚Äì the spec was small and well-defined - it didn't require complex advanced features of the language - I knew it would be useful for me and people like me on a daily basis."", ""For learning & hobby projects, that combination of usability, simplicity and small scope is key.

This is the first time I've been working with binary executables. For almost two decades, I've loved web for its distribution model ‚Äî you write code, deploy to server and it's updated for everyone. With executables, people need to proactively update their versions which means I need to think about new ways to reach them and communicate."", 'Certain things are also much slower for me to develop.

Even though I have a theoretical understanding of how they work and what their benefits are, my development too often comes to a halt and I need to rethink and refactor things a lot more with Rust.', ""Luckily, the Rust community is great and I've gotten so much help in my learning journey from local and global Rust developers who have been so helpful and compassionate when I've been stumbling around trying to understand the basics of the language and how to write it."", 'In 2013, Spice Program was born as our open source and social impact program.

She's the CEO of Octopus Centre for Net Zero, a research and development body of Octopus Group whose aim is to bring together government and industry to fight for climate‚Ä¶",[],"['We recently spoke with Lucy Yu ‚Äì CEO of the recently launched Octopus Centre for Net Zero ‚Äì to discuss energy, the home and mobility. In this conversation, we explored recent developments in energy infrastructure, how customer expectations are changing, and what is needed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. ', 'As head of a research facility looking into net-zero solutions, what are some of the initial opportunities and challenges that you‚Äôll feel are most relevant, in both the domestic home energy and mobility sector?', 'Fundamentally we‚Äôre trying to help uncover faster and fairer pathways to net zero through three things: research, thought-provoking engagement, and the development of open technology for energy systems modelling (open source and open data).', 'We can think about the energy transition as being about people and technology. We can consider the technology part as a combination of hardware transformation and software transformation.', 'Hardware transformation for mobility is mainly about improving and supporting the switch from internal combustion engines to battery electric vehicles, which also requires building better infrastructure for charging. While in the home, the hardware focus is around electrifying utilities, such as converting from gas to electric heating, ground source heat pumps, and the like.', 'Software transformation is focused on the products and services necessary to not just support but accelerate the transition - while creating a better customer experience in the process. For example, Octopus Go is a time-of-use (TOU) tariff designed specifically for electric vehicle owners, to help them charge their vehicle charges during off-peak hours (at off-peak prices). There‚Äôs also Octopus Agile, an open-data solution that shows customers tariff prices in 30-minute increments, 24 hours ahead of time. Interestingly, we‚Äôve seen some ‚Äúearly adopter‚Äù customers use that data to develop their own APIs to instruct their smart home devices to only use energy when it‚Äôs most economical. These are just two examples of how software solutions can enable sustainable energy consumption in both the mobility and domestic space, while increasing convenience and reducing cost.', 'The key is that it‚Äôs not just about making the data available or better tariff communication, it‚Äôs about making it easy for the customer to enter the electric world. For example, there are solutions such as Ohme who make smart charging cables that automatically charge your electric vehicle when tariffs are low. Looking ahead, I believe it will be about automating more of these decisions on behalf of the consumer, to reduce the friction of change, and allow them to enjoy the end result without having to manually manage the details.', 'So while it may take a few more years for solutions like these to fully blossom and come to the market, these are the core challenges we should focus on. We need to find ways to reduce the burden of manual processes for consumers so that they can access the sustainable (and cost-effective) benefits of these innovative products and services.', 'That‚Äôs fascinating to hear customers are building their own APIs to take advantage of software-enabled tariffs. As we know, user workarounds are often a harbinger of products and services to come. Are there any other unexpected opportunities that you‚Äôve seen as this technology is adopted?', 'Sure. It‚Äôs rare, but there are instances where TOU tariffs open the possibility for energy providers to pay customers, instead of the other way round. It‚Äôs called Plunge Pricing - getting paid to take excess energy off the grid because it balances the network. That‚Äôs an extreme example, but what‚Äôs important here, is that it illustrates how value can flow in both directions, which is unlike anything the previous energy sector could offer. The old centralised approach to energy only saw customers as consumers. But now, customers can produce their own energy, store and discharge it through battery systems, and potentially support the grid through a more distributed model, while enjoying some unexpected benefits as a result.', 'Sounds very exciting, particularly for Spain or California, but what about blustery Britain? How can we enable this new energy paradigm, where value flows both ways between parties, in countries like the UK where self-produced renewable energy (like solar) isn‚Äôt as consistent?', 'I feel we‚Äôve got a step to go through before we can fully exploit a two-way system. First, we need to transition the entire system to be more digital and data-driven. For example, there are still many situations where our understanding of household energy consumption is limited at a very aggregate level. We don‚Äôt yet have real-time demand data across the system. So solutions like smart meters are essential to getting us through this first step (only 31% of UK households use smart meters in smart mode). Our current challenge is to get to a point where we have a more digital infrastructure and much more data in the system. And while that‚Äôs happening, we need to continue the transition of other hardware elements, such as from petro-diesel vehicles to EVs, for example. Then we would be in a place to explore the full potential of this two-way participation.', 'That makes sense, and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot of existing effort along those lines. I‚Äôm curious, once we achieve that, what do you foresee will be the new - perhaps unexpected - opportunities in this two-way energy marketplace?', 'Looking ahead, I think some of the interesting questions will be: what sort of new entities will exist in that sort of energy market, and what new services will appear as a result of two-way participation? Consider, as an individual home your participation would obviously be small, but multiplied across hundreds of thousands of households, that could represent a significant impact at the macro level. I could imagine a role for an agent that represents a community - it could be a few residential streets, or perhaps an entire city - and acts on behalf of their collective, localised needs in a future energy market.', 'The challenge will be, how to optimise such a complex system. In the current system, there is a centralised system operator responsible for ensuring the system is balanced and resilient. As the system becomes decentralised and increases in complexity, the management of energy supply and system balancing could be optimised and occur at different levels. And so the question becomes, what will be the new rules of engagement, and how will the energy market begin to evolve in that direction?', 'In the end, it will undoubtedly require a massive effort to get us to net-zero. Do you anticipate this will be achieved mostly through behavioural shift or technological change?', 'There‚Äôs been a good deal of research around that. In the Sixth Carbon Budget paper, a report from the Committee on Climate Change from Dec 2020, they modelled a scenario called ‚ÄúThe Balance to Net Zero Pathway,‚Äù which showed how we can achieve net-zero by 2050 if we made a concerted effort now. In it, they broke down the contribution of societal and behavioural changes towards net-zero into three parts: 16% of the impact will come from pure behaviour change (ie. eat less meat, reduce air travel, etc.); 41% will come from pure technology solutions (renewable energy, smart systems, etc); but the remaining 49% will come from novel hybrid solutions which come about as a combination of behavioural and technological change.', 'And this is what is most exciting - a combination of automated solutions, plus a bit of a mindset shift, to reduce friction and increase convenience and cost efficiency for the consumer. Imagine a smart car charger that can anticipate the amount of energy you‚Äôll need that day, based on your daily schedule, and purchase the appropriate amount of energy when the tariff is lowest (and the grid has the lowest demand). This would facilitate a mindset shift in the consumer, where instead of worrying about the number - having 20% tank of petrol - you would have confidence that you have the right amount of energy for the journeys you need to make that day. You don‚Äôt over-purchase, and systems are optimised from the grid to the household level. That‚Äôs how smart systems can help enable and accelerate our journey to net zero, and I anticipate we‚Äôll see a lot more activity in that space in the near future.', ""That concludes our interview with Lucy Yu.

Here are our edited highlights.', ""Centrica‚Äôs recent partnership with Lotus revealed that the Electric Vehicle (EV) challenge is twofold ‚Äî there's getting EVs on the market and creating a post-purchase service that supports the customer's energy ecosystem. Could you expand on this idea of a wider ecosystem?"", ""In the partnership with Lotus, we started by asking ‚Äòwhat's the opportunity between the car and the energy supplier?‚Äô There‚Äôs a conception that the OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) and energy suppliers are the ones driving the changes and solutions in the grey space between them but in reality, it‚Äôs now being driven by customer behaviour. They are the ones starting to ask what the interplay between energy and mobility is and ‚Äòhow does my EV and energy provider connect to provide a seamless experience?‚Äô"", 'As two companies, we viewed the problem from the customers perspective, worked through the solutions, and we found that multiple digital reference points are being used to navigate this grey space and the new world of EVs for customers ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs looking for a charging point or which vehicle is best for your lifestyle, customers have better adjusted themselves to the EV world through their smartphones than, say, car dealerships.', 'Another reason why we are predicting an environment (rather than an ecosystem) for the future EV platform is because the traditional idea of energy suppliers as single service monoliths is rapidly changing. In part, because they are searching for new streams of revenue and so are diversifying their products, bringing added value to customers beyond cost per unit of energy, but now also convenience (through products such as Time of Use tariffs) and sustainability credentials, this doesn‚Äôt apply just at home. Energy is no longer just the yearly contract for your home.', 'Looking back at it, what started off a partnership between Lotus, an 80-year-old iconic brand, which is famous for lightweight sports cars and Centrica, a 200-year-old organisation that provides energy solutions, quickly became about this grey area and making us ask ‚ÄòWhere does the EV journey actually start for a customer?‚Äô', 'And we‚Äôre still in that innovative phase of EVs, with only 2.7% of the total sales volume in the UK as BEVs in 2020 (SMMT 2021). So, the current thinking is how do we establish the primary market? Especially post-pandemic as we expect more EVs on the market, more discerning customers (as people move out of their 1st or 2nd gen EVs and want more features and functions), and we‚Äôve all had this new view around sustainability, having appreciated the cleaner air and quieter streets.', 'So the need to establish an efficient EV environment is becoming crucial.', 'As Centrica is connected to the evolution EV infrastructure, what are the important needs and challenges for an energy provider and what‚Äôs your view around the common issue of load management?', 'Energy supply and EV charging products are natural partners, but what‚Äôs important from a supplier perspective is how can they add value to the customer and bring functionality to what has historically been a ‚Äòdumb‚Äô charging infrastructure, i.e. the interface between high voltage systems and the end product (EVs, scooters, etc). Both issues align with a more fundamental challenge of what if everyone switches to EVs today, could the grid handle it?', 'The National Grid has modelled that it‚Äôll only impact the total load by a small percentage which sounds sufficient but doesn‚Äôt tackle the issue of how they would manage the peaks. It‚Äôs those peaks that are unsustainable and cause concerns. The TV Pickup phenomenon (when a large group of people have synchronised use of electric devices, on average a 200-400 megawatt demand) requires an independent set of resources to manage, the impact could be exponential if as many people come home and charge their electric cars at 7 pm.', 'A solution currently used is Time of Use tariffs ‚Äî it promotes customers to charge their vehicles at low traffic or high energy production hours (timed with when renewable production is at its peak). But the common complaint is that energy suppliers are entrusted to assure that their customers‚Äô car is charged whenever they need it, not to be confined to when‚Äôs best for the grid or reduced carbon intensity. To have a better customer experience it has to be the customer‚Äôs choice and the supplier supports it, regardless if the result is cost-related or eco-focused. This goes back to the need for a well-managed environment for energy. Those are where the opportunities for suppliers to add value to the customer and minimise the infrastructure cost. It‚Äôs a solution focussed on better management, rather than new development. That‚Äôs why a smart charging infrastructure is going to be important.', 'As a footnote though, when we think about the infrastructure already built that can be utilised by EVs, the majority is ‚Äòdumb‚Äô and needs a serious overhaul to provide an intelligent and fit for purpose network. The risk is obsolete and stranded assets give a terrible customer experience at best, and compromise safety at worst. An idustry report that came out recently said that in the UK market we will need 5 times the number of chargers than we currently have to reach 2035 EV predictions. So the opportunity is here today to build a smart & integrated network.', 'It‚Äôs often stated that EVs are just consumption devices to the network. Do you agree or do you see EVs as a storage device or even a contributive machine?', 'In my opinion, EVs are virtual power plants. Fundamentally, they are batteries on wheels. Two recent protocols that expand EVs beyond just energy consumption are the Vehicle to Home (V2H) model and the Vehicle to Grid (V2G) model. We‚Äôve seen in Japan, for example, EVs with bi-directional ports are used as emergency electric ‚Äúgenerators‚Äù (related article). The same tech can be used to offset home energy use, so you could minimise your carbon footprint and energy bill, by using your car battery to supplement your energy demand. The latter V2G model allows the battery to interact with the grid, helping to smooth the peaks of demand and utilise the availability in the troughs for a financial reward.', 'The traditional view of vehicles as just transportation can be radically changed when they also function as an arbitrage for energy. Suddenly the total cost of ownership goes down because it‚Äôs reducing your overall operating cost and can generate revenue.', 'In fact, for fleet owners this becomes more imperative and builds a better case for EV adoption as they could use their fleet to contribute to the grid and lower their total ownership cost, that‚Äôs something a traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) fleet cannot offer.', 'Though there have been positive use cases for the Vehicle to Home and Vehicle to Grid models, but adoption has been slow. What do you see as the major challenges with today‚Äôs bidirectional networks?', 'The main hurdle is product. Currently, there is only one protocol which is from CHAdeMo, primarily a fast charging method for BEVs. Therefore, V2G is still in its infancy. Mainstream European EVs use Combined Charging Systems (CCS) which have yet to have bidirectional capabilities. But once that‚Äôs realised, it will be a tipping point.', 'Currently, bidirectional charging is far more expensive for manufacturers than one way or smart charging. Once we have more adoption the economy of scale will bring down the cost and further promote the benefits.', 'In the past, you‚Äôve mentioned the need to further educate and communicate. What do you feel are some holes in the data?', 'When it comes to education around EVs, there are still a lot of misconceptions in the discourse ‚Äî such as if everyone went electric, it‚Äôll bring the grid down or would I get electrocuted if I go to a car wash? (I‚Äôve seriously heard that before). This all stems from the lack of a foundational level of understanding around EV. Surprisingly, there‚Äôs still a lot of sensationalised news used against EVs like videos of battery car fires, but those don‚Äôt put into perspective how many more ICE vehicles burst into flames every day (1,898 petrol and diesel fires compared to 54 electric vehicles in 2019, London Fire Brigade). Another, which is very common, is range anxiety with EVs, yet around 3000 ICEs are recovered because they ran out of fuel en-route every day in the UK. There‚Äôs still a huge perceptive change to be had around EVs.', 'The contradiction is that we know there are a ton of tangible advantages of EVs but it just isn‚Äôt being communicated effectively to the customer ‚Äî both on a domestic or fleet level. The education and trusted source of information are some of the key pieces of work with the Lotus partnership.', 'On the data side, I believe 5G and the adoption of IoTs (Internet of Things)will be a big influence, especially for the EV network, because vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and V2G communication is going to be a seamless transition with electric cars compared to ICEs. That‚Äôs where the EV ‚Äòtrinity‚Äô comes into play ‚Äî with Zero emissions, Zero congestion and Zero collisions (through V2V communication & ADAS systems) EVs could supersede ICEs dramatically.', 'If OEMs, energy suppliers and chargers were more collaborative we could better predict the car type, its capacity and needs then we can more effectively manage load, both to benefit the grid and the customer. Around each of those factors comes the need for transparency of data in the EV environment. Ultimately, breaking down the silos of data, networks and organisations will help adoption scale faster and the supporting mobility system be more resilient.', 'As there are still many opportunities for change in the EV environment, how should OEMs maintain future thinking when manufacturing?', 'As energy and automotive are progressively working closer, I think OEMs should expand on the idea of connectivity to the wider EV environment. There‚Äôs still a reluctance there, I believe mainly due to prioritisation, battery research and development comes first for OEMs.', 'But from a supplier view, it‚Äôs important to maintain a resilient network, ensuring supply capabilities, provide a cost-efficient energy transaction and also giving the customer greater benefits.', 'If communication between the two becomes more open, then the OEM can bring new products to market while the supplier supports the customer needs, but until then, cost and innovation will continue to be an issue. Ultimately this is worse for the customer because there will always be friction that comes with ownership, such as having to learn about charging options rather than the straightforward A to B option they know from ICEs.', 'The solution for all players, from OEM to supplier, is to work collaboratively to build a seamless EV environment for the customer.', ""That concludes our interview with Carl Bayliss.

We have summarized all these resources in a single extensive guide.', 'Download our comprehensive data mesh guide', 'Introduced by Zhamak Dehghani, data mesh has lately been one of the most actively discussed topics related to data platform thinking and data architectures. It takes an approach derived from domain-driven design, and introduces it into the data world. The very same approach has already disrupted the software industry and pushed it to move from monolithic solutions to microservice-based architectures, and from centralized IT teams to local domain teams. Now, the same is happening for predetermined organizational data platform architecture and a centralized data team.', 'Data mesh has increased in popularity and gained a lot of traction as organizations have faced organizational and architectural shortcomings, which lead to businesswise nonoptimal data solutions and limit the business value from data.', 'Data mesh represents a paradigm shift in the way we think about and manage data platforms and architectures. It means moving away from a centralized unified data platform governed by one massive data platform team, and towards decentralized independent domain teams. These teams are responsible for managing, owning and serving the data within their domain as products. This sort of decentralized data management approach has several benefits including', 'Efficient data mesh implementation provides the benefits of radically decreasing lead times and giving business domains the ability to quickly prioritize and make decisions that are relevant to them. It brings data available through the organization while at the same time providing freedom on the technological level. The key benefit of data mesh is not primarily technical, but rather organizational and cultural.', 'Current data platform thinking has certain problems ‚Äì referred to as *architectural failure mode*s by Dehghani.

Data is viewed as a product, and each domain handles and serves data related to their area of business.', 'According to data mesh architectural principles, domains are responsible for their data products as well as their quality. These are offered to other domains through predefined interfaces such as APIs or flat files. Even though domains have their own solutions, they can share the same infrastructure. This can create cost benefits with economies of scale. As domains own the data products, they can quickly respond to new needs with their own prioritization.', 'In decentralized data management, domain teams are able to focus on their data products, bring in new data sources, and further develop solutions that they understand and are able to prioritize from the business perspective. Data mesh thereby fosters data-driven innovation by allowing greater autonomy and flexibility for data owners.', 'Data mesh decentralizes both data ownership and data skills by distributing these among cross-functional domain teams. In a decentralized data management model such as data mesh, experts‚Äô skillsets are broader and enable easier rotation of technical specialists between different data products. Domains also have the ability to match the needed competence profiles to their specific needs.', 'To truly understand the challenges and benefits as well as how data mesh addresses these, I recommend reading the original posts by Dehghani:', 'Current data platform architecture built on a centralized data lake and/or data warehouse is not going out of existence ‚Äì and that‚Äôs not the goal of data mesh. A centralized data platform with a specialized team usually works well for small and medium-sized enterprises and organisations whose data landscape is not constantly changing, or whose business domains are relatively simple.', 'But, Dehghani argues, when an organisation grows in size, its data domains also become more diverse and new data sources are introduced at a fast pace. That‚Äôs when preceding technical architectures and ways of organizing start resulting in unnecessary friction and slowing in data-related needs.', 'Comparing data mesh to data lake is largely futile as the terms are conceptually very different from each other. Data lakes are data storage repositories, which store, organize, protect and offer data while data mesh is a set of principles for decentralized data management. The main objective of both, in essence, is to offer faster time to analytical insights and increase the business value of analytics.', 'In a data mesh architecture data is usually distributed and queried from domain owned data storages, some of them being data lakes. Data lakes and data mesh can therefore co-exist and complement each other.', 'It is impossible to draw a clear line for when preceding approaches and data architecture become ineffective.

Over time, the architecture is often expanded beyond these main pipeline types, but as a result, these require compromises and differentiating architectural decisions that will either add technical complexity, or lack the full potential of optimal solutions.', 'This can be evaluated by asking whether your data platform is able to fulfill all requested use cases, and still maintain an acceptable level of technical complexity for your data platform team.', 'A suboptimal setup can display several symptoms:', 'As digital transformation spreads across society and organizations become more data-advised, we should no longer try to fool ourselves into thinking that the current data platform model will scale for everyone.', 'Finding public examples of companies that already utilize data mesh is still a difficult task apart from a few exceptions:', 'These references to data mesh implementations still represent the early stages of utilizing the paradigm, and questions about the sustainability, maintainability or ROI of the approach remain unanswered.

This is a write-up of the discussion, edited for clarity. Head here to watch the full video.', ' Lucy Yu Board Member at Connected Places Catapult\nExperienced in tech-innovations & entrepreneurship, Lucy has been a powerful advocate for net-zero cities, sustainable growth and energy policies across both private and public enterprises.', 'Chris Pritchett Partner and Head of Energy and Future Mobility at Foot Anstey\nWith multiple accolades in the field, Chris provides legal and business solutions for those committed to their energy and sustainability goals.', 'Chris Pateman-Jones CEO at Connected Kerb\nAn environmentalist with a rich background in energy infrastructures, Chris is the CEO of Connected Kerb ‚Äî a company focussed on building efficient solutions for the EV charging market and ecosystem.', 'Sustainability has been a buzzword for the industry but what does being sustainable actually mean? And why is it important to you?', 'Chris Pritchett of Foot Anstey: Often we hear a one-sided definition for sustainability, which is around the environmental aspects, but there‚Äôs a second definition. Sustainability in a commercial sense means that you can continue to offer value in the future. And those are not mutually exclusive: a truly sustainable business is one that is delivering on its green goals and has resilient revenue. The narrative that it‚Äôs ‚Äòeither/or‚Äô is changing but we need to change it faster. At Foot Anstey, we‚Äôre continuing to see that business with true purpose, vision and drive to genuinely create change are the ones that are better at engaging the customer and are gaining more contractual opportunities as well. It‚Äôs never been more important to be a business with purpose and passion.', 'Chris Pateman-Jones of Connected Kerb: Sustainability, in terms of mobility, would be to see more people transition from Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) to Electric Vehicles (EVs) options, such as battery EVs and plug-in Hybrid EVs, on a macro level. But it‚Äôs also about the sustainability or resiliency of the products and infrastructure we are developing.', 'There is a common consensus that if you‚Äôre deploying an EV infrastructure you are, by default, sustainable. And though that may be the case when compared to a petrol station, it is not the only sustainability channel you should adhere to. Seeing business challenges through a sustainable lens can make for more resilient and commercially viable solutions. As an example, when thinking about how to build robust charge points, we explored various materials and opted for recycled car tyres. A tyre‚Äôs construction is far more resilient than any other composite on the market, and in the long run, that solution reduced our net cost as we don‚Äôt have to renovate them as often as others. By saving on charge point renovations, we reduce the charging price for the customer, therefore making our option more inclusive and commercially viable. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has a good outlook on the circular economy which is recently being implemented in various businesses in a viable way.', 'This is what we believe has pushed Connected Kerb further in the industry.

What we‚Äôve found is in multiple sectors, including mobility, the ones that are finding solutions that satisfy all three are truly sustainable.', 'Our panellists agreed that collaboration is key for us to not only meet our individual sustainability goals but also those of the planet. But there are different approaches and definitions to what types of cross-sector partnership is needed.', 'Chris Pateman-Jones explained that capabilities and how you work plays a fundamental role in how Connect Kerb approaches things: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an understanding that reaching our sustainability goals cannot be done by one company, so we built our team to be small and focused but ready to work collaboratively on solutions. Because of that our team has a focus on rethinking solutions rather than rebuilding. Ultimately, we see our product as an infrastructure build. The tech for Connected Kerb is at the base of each socket. There we have a universal dock and anode system where we can put in inductive wireless charging and 5g antennas as there‚Äôs a fibre connection there. So we can stack other applications alongside our charge point solutions, adding to the innovations we can support.‚Äù', 'Following on from Pateman-Jones, Chris Pritchett added that collaboration is an overused word but an underutilised approach. ‚ÄúMany try to provide the best solution but working in a silo is ineffective, especially when it comes to sustainable solution thinking. The clock is against us and what we‚Äôre seeing, from multiple collaborations we‚Äôve supported, is that successful projects are when parties come together with genuine intention and generosity in the collaboration. It‚Äôs also worth identifying that if two parties come together just because they have to then it‚Äôs cooperation, collaboration is more of a relationship built around solution thinking.‚Äù', 'Pritchett added that collaboration with an aligned purpose is how we can reach sustainability fast and sufficiently. As well as business partnerships, we need to collaborate with the citizen or user so that it‚Äôs not just focussed on the commercial interest.', 'The critical factor for Lucy Yu is finding a way to make sustainability the most attractive option for all, from investors and cities to infrastructure and product to the end-user. We are at this tipping point for further investment into sustainability and there‚Äôs an opportunity for policymakers and regulators to provide better incentives, such as the Benefit Kind Tax. Those create the buying signal that makes sustainability the better option for investors and businesses.', 'She explains that for citizens, sustainable solutions do fulfil the social responsibility desire but they also have to compete on cost and convenience. With more investment, development and policy incentive, we can make the sustainable option the most desirable option on all fronts.', 'So we‚Äôve gathered a better understanding of what sustainable mobility is and how we should approach it, but what should be our focus for the future?', 'Lucy explained how currently cost is a hurdle for sustainability. We have yet to see the Economy of Scale‚Äôs impact, as adoptions of EVs is still low. But Governmental influence can play a huge role in promoting more sustainable options. When the UK government announced that new petrol and diesel cars cannot be sold after 2030, there was a seismic shift in EV manufacturing and it provided OEMs with the confidence and incentive to invest in their EV portfolio.', 'Chris Pateman-Jones followed by stating that current EV owners are seen as outliers as there are extremely early-adopters and commonly have an EV as a second car. Most car owners in the UK don‚Äôt have a second car, so we have to consider how the transition would impact the majority. He expanded on Lucy‚Äôs view around behavioural incentives, adding that we have to fundamentally understand what customers want and it seems to be that they want extreme convenience. With our current infrastructure, we haven‚Äôt met that need. Most are charging their EVs at home where it‚Äôs most convenient, but the market is focussed on rapid charging solutions.', 'Since last year, Covid has changed behaviours drastically, the UK government has created a 10 point, green industrial plan and a lot of money is flowing into infrastructure. But change impacts everyone differently.', 'Pateman-Jones sees the change to the sector as a net positive, but one that has impacted local authorities negatively. They‚Äôve received a huge amount of pressure to execute those plans and are often held most accountable. But for the most part, local governments don‚Äôt have the expertise or capacity to focus on things like infrastructure development. Chris believes the solution is to give resources to educate the public and supporting local authorises to make the right decision.', 'The other side is the change in ambition and capital assignment. The government has done well to start but the SMMT reported that we need 2.4 million charging points with a ¬£16 billion investment by 2035. That‚Äôs where capital from the private sector can come in, thinks Pateman-Jones, with a move from product and appliance to infrastructure building.', 'Chris Pritchett agreed that there is a huge amount of capital that‚Äôs ready to deploy. Currently, that capital is mainly being added from local authority contracts, but those need to evolve because there‚Äôs a lot of responsibility to deliver and often it requires a wider partnership to fulfil ‚Äî that‚Äôs where the private sector can support to better connect those dots. Germany‚Äôs approach is a good example, as their power is directed to the municipal level, giving them the willingness and capacity to deliver. Pritchett explained that his approach would be to give the local authorities better tools to engage with the private sector.', 'In terms of policy movements, Chris explains that it should be looked at holistically. All too often, in both the energy and mobility sectors, incentives would be placed towards one objective, more bike lanes, bigger busses etc. But in reality, not much attention is being given to looking at how cities and high street operate and mobility as a whole within the system. They are silo projects when we actually need to integrate them. Mobility as a Service (MaaS), says Chris Pritchett, is asking the right question as it looks at how to connect transport to maximise convenience and deliver as many solutions in one package. There‚Äôs also the silo of departments. Mobility challenges can fall under the environmental office or travel department or urban planning, but in reality, all of those players should come together and look at the challenge holistically, only then can you align net-zero, infrastructure updates and social impact and not just try to tackle them in an insufficient silo.', 'Chris Pateman-Jones continued this point, adding that the opportunities highlighted can also be the challenges. Explaining that when Connect Kerb has conversations with the central government, it includes the Cabinet Office, Infrastructure Project Association, but it also extends to the Department of Travel, DCMS, and the Department of Work and Pensions because we‚Äôre looking at mobility solutions for the less able ‚Äî often each member has their own agenda with different priorities. That‚Äôs where coordination becomes a hurdle. But with some issues scale can be the solution. For example, if a charge point operator is only assigned 10 spots, they will choose the most economically appropriate options but if you assign 1,000 spots then it becomes a portfolio of both low and high performing assets which then allows for freedom to choose the most inclusive options.', 'The government can show leadership there and push for scale as they have the power and assets such as hospitals, real estates, schools etc, to deploy charge points and improve the green infrastructure.', 'As we move towards smart, green cities, data has become a central topic. TfL open data plans have opened up more mobility options to the public. Do you see data as a fundamental part of sustainable mobility?', 'Chris Pateman-Jones: We use data to evaluate where we place our charging points and often it has disapproved assumptions. For example, there‚Äôs this idea that wealthy areas are where usage is highest but actually wealthy people tend to live close to where they work so don‚Äôt travel much. So we often offer our data to clients so they can make more informed decisions.', 'Lucy Yu: The TfL API plans have enabled a bunch of mobility platforms to offer better options to the public. For example, Citymapper made London the first city on the global platform because of the TfL API and that also added value to London, its citizens and the open opportunities for the private sector. So it fulfilled all aspects of the aforementioned Golden Trinity. There are still a lot of opportunities in this area, such as including EV charging, or more micro-mobility options.', 'A recent road trip in a Nissan Leaf showed me how many shortfalls there are in the EV infrastructure in terms of data and communications, especially around charge points. That‚Äôs where I think an open data plan would be essential.', 'Chris Pritchett: Open data is critical for not only mobility but for the wider decarbonisation and sustainability challenges we face. Foot Anstey recently worked with the Government Energy Data Taskforce and during an initial sprint we looked at open data solutions from the likes of TfL and FinTech, and it made us realise how behind the mobility and energy sector is. Taking an open approach to data is integral to any challenge that has multiple players. Plus it can greatly improve the user experience and allow for more sustainable choices. In fact, it can be a way to improve engagement and provide incentives for sustainable options ‚Äî such as promote tourists to walk or cycle around the city and display its history throughout, offloading the peak of commuter transport at 9 am and 6 pm.', 'What can OEMs do to make sustainable mobility more attractive to the public?', 'Chris Pritchett: OEMs have recently been doing more to make their sustainability options more attractive, but with incidences like Aston Martin‚Äôs Astongate and VW‚Äôs Dieselgate, they realised how accountable they are to actually deliver a viable product. It takes investment and time to bring EVs to the market, but it‚Äôs optimistic seeing established manufacturers such as GM seriously join the EV market.', 'Chris Pateman-Jones: Supporting the transition in all aspects of the automotive industry is what‚Äôs important. Currently, at the top of the funnel ‚Äì at the manufacturing end ‚Äì EVs are becoming more prominent but the investment is needed to improve manufacturing globally and support the transition at the auto-retail level as well as, where ICEs are still being pushed over EVs.', 'Do you see collaborations such as the Energy Superhub Oxford (ESO) getting more transition with other counties in the UK?', 'Chris Pateman-Jones: Connected Kerb is currently involved in a few county-driven solutions and I suspect that it will grow. But it‚Äôs worth noting that ESO is just one model and may not be viable for all. But what‚Äôs important is the public-private partnership, as it aids the decarbonisation of transport at scale. A county can have more impact than just one private company attempting to change the entire county. So it can and should be replicated but bespoke to each project.', 'Lucy Yu: I agree, it will gain traction across the country. The personalisation of each solution could create some innovative conclusions we have yet to see that would enable a modal shift for sustainable mobility.', 'You can view the full video of our webinar here.

Getting started with hooks is quite straightforward, but you might need to change the way you think about your components, especially when it comes to the useEffect hook.', 'This blog assumes you know the basics of React Hooks ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt you can find out more here ‚Äì and will dive a bit deeper into how they should be used. I‚Äôll also be sharing a bit about the mistakes we made and how it took us nearly a month to fix the mess.', ""React Hooks were launched in React version 16.8 and they have quickly become a popular way to handle components, local states, and component side effects, among other things. They‚Äôre quite easy to get started with, but they're challenging to master properly ‚Äì you have to learn to think a bit differently compared to React‚Äôs traditional class components and lifecycle hooks, and there are certain rules that you have to follow."", 'The simplest hook is the useState hook, which takes as an argument the initial state. useState is a function that returns an array with two items in it: the first is the actual state and the second is a function that sets the state. Another of the built-in hooks is useEffect, which is for running side effects in your React function components. For example, if you have a shopping cart with a button to add a banana, when a banana is added you might want the document title to be updated as a side effect. With useEffects, you define the dependencies ‚Äì you can think of it like defining the array and how often you want to run the function. If you leave it as an empty array, it will only run once, after the initial render; otherwise, it will run after every render of the function, unless you define the dependencies. So, when the state changes, React just calls this function again. And from a useEffect function, you can return a cleanup function.', ""To understand the useEffect cleanup, try this analogy from Ryan Florence. Imagine you have only one bowl in your house to eat cereal from. You wake up in the morning and eat cereal whether you're hungry or not ‚Äì that's the initial render. Time passes, the state changes, and you become hungry again. Now you need to clean the bowl because it's dirty from when you ate earlier. You clean it up first and then you eat again ‚Äì this is the same as React running a cleanup before running the effect again, which is also why when a component is unmounted it runs the cleanup when it's removed."", ""I‚Äôve just mentioned two of the most important hooks, but let's talk a bit about typical mistakes with hooks. The first mistake you might make when you start using useEffect is you might forget to add the dependency array, meaning your effect will run on every render. Why is this a problem? Imagine you're doing a fetch in your useEffect. This would happen on every render, causing a new render because something was changing the state of the component. This would make it render again, causing an infinite loop. Another typical mistake you can make when you start refactoring useEffects is having a useEffect that depends on the state that is saved inside it. This causes another infinite loop, but you can solve it by doing functional state updates instead of traditional useState calls."", ""The simplest rule is that hooks must start with ‚Äúuse‚Äù ‚Äì I think React will even warn you if you try to do something that doesn't start with use. Next, call hooks should only be used at the top level of your function components, so you can't nest them in statements. This is because React only relies on the order of the hook calls, so for every render you should call the same number of hooks so that React knows which hook is which. Finally, you can only call hooks from React functions. This should probably be self-explanatory, but when I started using hooks, I wanted to use them in some utility functions, and I realized quickly it just isn't possible. ESLint is very useful to check these rules. There are two plugins that I can recommend: react-hooks/rules-of-hooks and react-hooks/exhaustive-deps."", ""So where did we go wrong? In the beginning of a project, we used TSLint instead of ESLint, because at that point TSLint wasn't deprecated yet, so we thought it would be fine. We had the React Hooks plugin installed and enabled, but for some reason we forgot to enable the React Hooks rules, so TSLint wasn‚Äôt actually checking the rules. We had it there for months and didn't notice, and because we didn't know the rules well enough, we didn't notice that our code was piling up into a huge mess."", 'At that point we changed from TSLint to ESLint, which was already a big refactoring PR because we also made our rules stricter. At first we had the exhaustive deps rule disabled after the refactoring, as well as one huge component where we had to add the ESLint ‚Äúdisable React‚Äôs rules of hooks‚Äù line, because the file was just too large to be fixed in that PR. And then I started fixing this mess and enabled the exhaustive deps rule and decided to just do what ESLint tells us. I thought it would take me a couple of days, it ended up taking more than a month to fix just the exhaustive-deps violations, including causing some regressions in production.', ""The most important thing we learned was to keep it simple, in both your React code base and in hooks. Even though you can make huge effects, it's better to split them into multiple effects ‚Äì and if this makes your component code looks ugly, you can abstract it away into a custom hook. Secondly, you should always enable ESLint rules and enforce them, and it‚Äôs best to have ESLint in your editor. At this point I‚Äôd also like to recommend Betterer ‚Äì a cool tool that can be used in legacy projects and in larger, ongoing projects to stop you from making the project worse over time. You add tests that make sure you stop doing the wrong things and forces you to do better in future. This is handy when you don‚Äôt have time, energy or resources for these kinds of huge refactoring PRs."", ""I also learned that custom hooks are quite cool. They are a really useful way to share code and logic between components. And during this refactoring I've learned when to use useReducer and when to use useState. useState is fine, but if you have more than, say, three useStates and you need to change a few of them at the same time but they're relying on each other, then it's better to use useReducer with one state object and then dispatch actions that update the state."", 'If you want to learn more about hooks and the rules of hooks, React‚Äôs official docs are amazing ‚Äì they explain the rules and why you have to follow them. If I had read them to start with I wouldn‚Äôt have made the mistakes I did! I‚Äôd also recommend taking a look at Dan Abramov‚Äôs blog, overreacted.io. A complete guide to useEffect is interesting, as is React as a UI Runtime, and how are function components different from classes will teach you some important differences.', 'This blog was based on one of my Tech Weeklies talks.

The newly launched Connected Health Kit by Futurice is designed to help healthcare organizations adopt data-enabled digital services and solutions.",[],"['Healthcare has a complicated relationship with change. The field is constantly evolving through scientific innovation and advances in medical technology, but many existing practices, processes, and workflows tend to change at a sluggish pace. The newly launched Connected Health Kit by Futurice is designed to help healthcare organizations adopt data-enabled digital services and solutions. ', 'The reasons for the slow pace of change are clear ‚Äì and understandable. Considering how even a relatively small change can have a far-reaching impact on the health and wellbeing of countless people, it‚Äôs easy to default to if it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it ‚Äì just to be on the safe side. This mindset hardly encourages the healthcare domain to proactively scrutinize its established practices, let alone try to improve them.', 'Even so, the sector is coming to terms with the fact that the future of healthcare is digital, connected, and fueled by data. In an effort to help the industry get there, Futurice has created the Connected Health Kit, a free-to-use set of tools to support the creation and adoption of data-enabled digital services and solutions.', 'In this interview, Design Director Gianni Cardone explains the core idea of the kit and the philosophy behind its creation.', 'So, Gianni, what exactly is the Connected Health Kit?', 'The Connected Health Kit is a toolkit designed for the healthcare domain, with two specific purposes in mind. First of all, to analyze workflows ‚Äì including the most complex ones ‚Äì and secondly, to facilitate the co-creation of new, data-enabled solutions and services for a wide variety of medical environments, processes and use cases.', 'And how would you describe it in layman‚Äôs terms?', 'Simply put, you could think of the kit as a collaborative tool. It helps identify opportunity areas with room for improvement, and create digital service concepts that utilize data and digital interfaces to simplify workflows and build better customer journeys.', 'Right, you don‚Äôt have to be a healthcare professional to acknowledge that sounds like a problem worth solving. So how does the kit approach this challenge?', 'The approach of the kit is three-fold. The first part has to do with reaching mutual understanding and breaking down silos. In a healthcare ecosystem, there are always several different viewpoints and disciplines at play. This is in many ways a valuable characteristic, but the situation is also ripe with potential for clashes and miscommunication, which in turn can disrupt the workflow. The hands-on nature of the Connected Health Kit aims to bring down walls between people with different backgrounds ‚Äì like doctors, nurses, lab technicians and IT specialists ‚Äì as they analyze and visualize current processes.', 'The second part is all about making things tangible. As we all know, the world of healthcare is complex and includes various different participants and workflows: Consider all the people involved with operating room or emergency room procedures, or patient logistics during a hospital visit. Rearranging all the involved components with the help of the Connected Health Kit enables teams to detect gaps in the healthcare journey, and make concepts more tangible by physically demonstrating those ideas.', 'And finally, the kit‚Äôs purpose is to make the complex simple. Anyone in the healthcare sector can use it to make a difference in their individual setup and use case ‚Äì you don‚Äôt need to be fully immersed in the world of health tech or digital health. Knowing your own part is enough to get started, after that it‚Äôs simply about involving the right people adjacent to your role.', 'How does it all look in practice?', 'We‚Äôve designed two different varieties of the kit in order to support as many teams and working setups as possible. First, there‚Äôs an all-digital one designed for remote and distributed teams ‚Äì this one‚Äôs complete and ready for anyone to use right now. But in addition to that, we‚Äôre also developing a physical version for teams based in the same location. The basic idea between the two versions is exactly the same.', '\nThe Connected Health Kit in use', 'The foundation of the kit is the map, something that depicts a physical space, like the emergency room of a hospital. When you use a map that reflects the same physical space you work in, you‚Äôre already making things tangible and concrete. In the digital version, you set up the map in the collaboration tool of your choice, like Miro, and in the physical version, it‚Äôs printed out for everyone to gather around.', 'After that you‚Äôll break out the tokens ‚Äì these are representations of patients, medical staff, devices and other assets that move around the environment. In the digital version these are illustrations, and the physical version will come with files you can use to have physical pieces 3D printed.', 'That actually sounds kind of similar to setting up a tabletop game.', 'Yes, and using the kit is definitely a playful, easy-going experience! But make no mistake ‚Äì at its core, it is a full-fledged service creation tool designed with serious professional use in mind.', 'All right, let‚Äôs assume we now have all the bits and pieces in place. What happens after the initial setup?', 'When you have everything in place, it‚Äôs time to dive in and focus on specific scenarios, workflows and challenges in your use case. This can mean unwanted gaps, bottlenecks or delays in the process, a suboptimal floor plan, or problems related to the flow of data between different points.', 'To facilitate this, we have the third and final major component of the kit, a set of cards that represent various actions. They are also meant to challenge the users‚Äô thinking, and make them take into account different aspects they might not have considered otherwise. All this serves to help users analyze the dynamics, connections and relationships between different elements and entities.', 'So the cards set the whole thing in motion and also mix things up with some unexpected questions. Now, who exactly is the Connected Health Kit intended for?', 'The beautiful part about the kit is that it is designed for anyone in the healthcare sector to use and make a difference in their context and use case. That said, there are a couple of specific groups we had in mind when creating it.', 'First and foremost, business and service owners in the healthcare industry ‚Äì from product managers to executives responsible for digital initiatives and software development ‚Äì as well as healthcare experts who lead the digital transformation process in their domain are the primary stakeholders who will benefit from the kit.', 'Additionally, given its goal to make complex processes more understandable and build a shared view of the challenges at hand, it‚Äôs a great tool for small, cross-functional teams ‚Äì ones that involve healthcare professionals as well as tech, design, business and/or data experts ‚Äì to approach complex problems in a group without losing the wealth that comes from their different perspectives.', 'The third group that we are certain will find use for the kit is managers in healthcare, everything from hospitals to laboratories and pharmaceutical companies. It helps them form a clear overview of the problems in their existing workflows, prioritize actions, onboard various stakeholders, and manage the quality assurance process in the workflows being analyzed.', 'Why is the kit relevant, and why right now?', 'In many industries, digital transformation has already been going on for years, and it has resulted in new digital services and holistic offerings being launched, and a new focus on the quality of the customer experience.', 'Healthcare, on the other hand, is a really complex field. The offering along the patient journey can be severely fragmented and disconnected, and digitalization is lagging behind in many aspects. We can often see that when we interact with healthcare providers as private citizens.', 'But things are changing here, too. Patients‚Äô expectations as well as new regulations and reimbursement models are driving the adoption of a more connected and digital healthcare offering. But this transition will also need a cultural change. And that‚Äôs exactly why it is essential to have access to the right tools and adopt ecosystem thinking to develop new solutions and connected services. The Connected Health Kit is a tool that aims to help the entire sector through this transition. It brings together different experts to collaborate and develop connected solutions for tomorrow‚Äôs digital medical field.', 'Before we wrap up, could you tell a bit more about how the kit was developed?', 'Our desk research and past projects within the health domain, have shown us how difficult it is to map and document complex relationships, journeys and workflows in the medical field. Various factors, roles, data input, and regulations have a substantially larger impact on the relationships between different players in the healthcare sector than what you‚Äôll see in other industries, and this made it very clear for us that building a shared overview and simplifying the complex is essential to creating a common ground for the ideation of new services.', 'Based on this need, we came up with the idea of creating a kit that would help with the analysis and co-creation of connected digital services for healthcare workflows. It was not an easy process. We built a number of draft versions of the kit, and along the way we interviewed dozens of experts to validate the methodology itself, as well as the plausibility of the solutions.', 'And to make things even trickier, this process took place entirely in a remote setup due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The situation is challenging for any kind of co-creation work to begin with, and even more so when designing a complex toolkit.', 'Nevertheless, we managed to finalize and launch the kit for public use in under four months. Given the circumstances, it was a particularly easy choice for us to start from the digital version of the Connected Health Kit to accommodate distributed teams in remote working sessions. But given the similarity of the two versions, adapting the assets for the physical version for in-person workshop use will be a relatively quick process, too.', 'Read more about the Connected Health Kit and download the assets here.

Based on data-generated predictive mobility models and commuting scenarios, the goal is the formation of efficient mobility behaviour through the interaction of technology and sustainability. Read the full interview to learn more about Abert‚Äôs take on partnerships, data, and how the Covid-19 crisis leads to behavioural changes that were hard to enforce before.', 'Looking at the urban mobility landscape around us, which problem is Carployee tackling and how?', '66% of all employees in the EU are commuting to work by car and 9 out of 10 are driving alone. Since the Covid-19 breakout, the occupancy rate has declined even further (of course, home office is one of many reasons). Our environment suffers from this situation, but also employees have to cope with high fuel costs and stress. On the other hand, companies experience high infrastructure costs and miss CSR activities in the area of sustainable behaviour. Existing shared mobility solutions like car-sharing are leading to less private mobility possession in urban areas but not reducing traffic significantly. Looking at cars, the main driver of efficiency is the occupancy rate. While car-sharing facilitates the - well of course - sharing of the car, with Carployee we are sharing the actual trip towards one specific location. We started by developing a B2B carpooling app which is used by corporates in the DACH area, mostly in rural and suburban areas. While carpooling is a good start, we strive for matching people on the same trip no matter which transportation modes they prefer to use. A change of habits can only be accomplished if mobility is combined with behavioural economics and measurable financial as well as environmental impact. We firmly believe this is the only way to create new mobility habits.', 'By using a combination of data collected by us, by the employers and public data we are able to generate predictive mobility models, simulating the optimum for individual, semi-global and fully global commuting scenarios.', 'What does the ideal future scenario of commuting look like for you?', 'When speaking about the future, we have a couple of different periods in mind. Until 2025, we expect a continuing strong shift towards home office for white collar workers and only about one to two days a week in the office. Commuting will be based on on-demand services, trimmed towards ideal office hours and sustainability metrics. Mobility will become even more interdisciplinary with active mobility as a vital measure for better health and fitness. As the climate crisis worsens, regulations and commitment towards sustainability will increase beyond metrics; taxes and stricter regulations will play an important part.', 'Beyond that, it is harder to predict the future, but I personally hope that Level-5 autonomous driving is awaiting us sooner than later. While I genuinely believe that autonomous driving will bring us much closer to a sustainable future, this step in technological improvement still relies on infrastructure which, by design, takes away green areas we could really need right now. Following this logic, if you look at market trends, I am certain that the future is airborne, and so are a lot of investors. Air taxis will make traditional highways obsolete but also pose a lot of new challenges.', 'Which role does data play in your business model?', 'A big one [laughing]! Currently, we are working on models that will help us and our customers to recognize their ideal commuting scenario. Using a combination of data collected by us, by the employers and public data we are able to generate predictive mobility models, simulating the optimum for individual, semi-global and fully global commuting scenarios.', 'At first, this seems like a rather easy task but information about weather, complex work time schedules and personal preferences create a problem that can only be solved by deploying meta-heuristics, which some would sell as artificial intelligence.', 'Together with researchers from the University of Salzburg we are tackling a lot of those challenges. Of course, we also use collected data points to evaluate impact and to sustain our business model, but I would rather not bore you with that.', 'Which conclusions about mobility behaviour and commuting habits of employees can be drawn from aggregated data? What trends do you observe?', ""To be honest, I am pretty certain that there are a lot of things that we are still missing, but in general we recognize a strong ‚Äúnever-change‚Äù mindset within commuters. As soon as people set on a form and a frequency of transportation, they stay with it forever until external factors, such as Covid-19, trigger a change. Observing current mobility behaviour is more interesting than ever as common patterns have been changing rapidly. For example, commuters are combining their daily commute with a fitness activity. Given infrastructural conditions at the employer's site, people are increasingly using their bicycles to get to work, even over longer distances. Moreover, the trend of mobility sufficiency is something we are currently really focused on. We no longer only focus on how a trip is done, but already start before that and ask the question if a trip has to be done. A difficult question to answer, but definitely the right one to ask."", 'What‚Äôs the biggest challenge Carployee is facing at the moment?', 'Our initial business model highly depends on active commuters using carployee. The impact of Covid-19 leads to social distancing and an increase in home office work, and therefore less carpooling. Nevertheless, our current effort in changing mobility habits of employees can benefit from this situation. Such events break up habits and lead to behavioural changes - which is our goal. Using this crisis as a chance is what we are fully committed to.', 'What role do you think partnerships play in smart mobility ecosystems and which ones are you looking to establish?', 'Partnerships and networks are the breeding ground for smart mobility ecosystems. Mobility providers, providers of apps for user interaction, and infrastructure operators must work together at eye level to offer user-friendly solutions. In our case, interdisciplinary combinations are important in addition to the partnerships described above. These are, for example, networks with employers, environmental agencies for impact measurability, and energy providers. It is important that all partners set the same goal and work in a customer-oriented manner - only then the often-cited mobility transformation is possible.', 'Mobility is not only business; it is also about us as a society. What changes are needed most in order to drive a sustainable development of urban mobility?', 'Changing existing mobility habits is the most important aspect. The question of how we change these habits is not fully answered yet. We are definitely working on it and rely on a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. In addition, there are other factors:', 'About Albert Vogl-Bader', '', 'Albert Vogl-Bader is CEO and Co-Founder of Carployee and drives sustainable commuter mobility in the current Mobility-as-a-Service trend.

Various tools already exist to help in that process, but in many companies, those are essentially just sitting unused in the toolbox.', 'Having worked intensively with energy companies across Europe, our educated guesstimate is that out of the eight typical data and AI offerings outlined in Mika‚Äôs book, usually two ‚Äì at most ‚Äì have been implemented to generate extra revenue. Additionally, the responsibility to explore different ways to utilize data is oftentimes assigned to someone who is already too busy in the first place, instead of a dedicated data monetization manager who could actually get things done and start delivering results in mere months.', '‚ÄúYup, that‚Äôs an opportunity lost,‚Äù I can hear you thinking.

He has a focus on customer tech and is exploring how to enhance connectivity.', 'National Express: Before Covid, National Express were planning to invest into developing strategic and visionary projects but as the pandemic came into focus there was a more cautioned and close look at their existing digital transformation programs. As the months have passed, there‚Äôs been a push to focus on revenue generation and safety. For example, they are working with local councils on a MaaS (Mobility as a Service) offering ‚Äî looking beyond the coach and bus services they provide to how they can be connected and support their customer‚Äôs entire journey.', 'Sanchit said that ‚Äòuntil now, National Express wasn‚Äôt exploring data deeply, now we are building to be a data-driven company.‚Äô As a result of the pandemic, National Express is planning to build an API and make their data available both internally and externally, opening new potential partnerships and collaborations.', 'Covid has shown that having an effective data structure and strategy is critical for any business. We took our learnings from projects with rail management company, VR Group and energy supplier, Fortum and wrote the Best Practices for Creating Fast Business Value from Data and Analytics.', 'They‚Äôve even changed their design and build philosophy, opting to bring micro-projects to market at pace rather than a ‚ÄòBig Bang‚Äô approach, this makes them more agile and able to implement changes faster.', 'TfL: Of course, COVID has brought down ridership significantly. With such a drastic adjustment we had to have clear communications. But beyond that, the TfL digital team didn‚Äôt actually see much disruption apart from the acceleration of some projects. For example, in the summer of 2020, they had to release TfL Go ahead of schedule. This is an app built in-house that gives customers a dynamic view of TfL‚Äôs services. It‚Äôs early release meant that when the lockdown was eased, riders were able to navigate changes in real-time.', ""Hanna commented that COVID didn‚Äôt change the business case or approach to the app, it just accelerated the roadmap. She highlighted other features to come, for example tracking the business of stations and options for walking and cycling. She also mentioned that their process hasn't changed much, the only difference is having to use remote user testing and that a lower ridership means a lower engagement for their digital services, therefore less feedback."", 'LNER: Danny mentioned that managing the team remotely has been challenging. Their digital team was very comfortable with tech but bringing on the rest of the company was a hurdle. This was especially prevalent when introducing products and services to frontline staff. He added that they‚Äôre normally present in person to demo new tech and use those sessions to learn.', 'A silver lining was that it presented good business cases for the CX projects they had in the pipeline. It brought more innovations to the fore at LNER, allowing them to work with AI, for example. Which gave proof of concept for ideas like seat mapping, live scheduling and allowed them to bring unique products to market faster ‚Äì like with their social distance tracking measures.', 'This also meant a change in their approach. They are now taking a McKinsey 3 horizon model which allows them to get projects done faster and to boost efficiency. They have also brought in new partners to add to their service offerings, such as the digital onboard food ordering service.', 'At National Express, there has been work to do to keep staff safe while also managing full services at only 30% capacity. This hasn‚Äôt just been a challenge though, as it‚Äôs also opened opportunities for the team to experiment more as they have less load to carry. They took this time to redesign their site and optimise their operational services. It also helps elevate their digital tools to more parts of their business, for example, they have developed a more efficient way to handle their form handling and licensing.', 'It also made National Express re-evaluate their routing strategy. They held a service sprint which looked at how to convert passages from cars to public transport and the key takeaway was to look at the passenger‚Äôs end destination, supporting that by any means, even offering help outside of core capabilities with trains, trams and so on.', 'This philosophy of experimental thinking beyond their ‚Äòcircle‚Äô has made fundamental changes throughout National Express. Sanchit mentioned adjustments to safety as an ongoing KPI, and that legal and management are invested in optimising assets and network planning, not limiting themselves to prior tools. \nCulture Change', 'LNER are using some of the disruption the pandemic has brought to analyse company culture and make improvements. As COVID has accelerated the digitisation of companies, it‚Äôs more apparent that quality, well implemented tech is now an absolute necessity. The conversation around digital and tech has, for example, helped the wider LNER team be more receptive to new ideas.', 'National Express has seen similar cultural changes. Sanchit said ‚Äòwith only a handful of staff members at the office, a huge investment has been made into tech and data management‚Äô.', 'Hanna made an interesting statement that ‚Äòwith any digital change comes a cultural change‚Äô. Adding that working remotely has changed their process but has caused the team to be much more productive, efficient and agile. She feels they‚Äôve found a just-right Goldilocks Zone, where everyone can move quickly and get strategic thinking into products and go live faster.', 'As a government-owned company, TfL does have different regulatory obligations to offer accessibility, more so than private companies might. Hanna explained that when developing the app they had to build a new language to make it easier to design more accessible features. This, she adds, will be an ongoing conversation that goes beyond the TfL Go app and that they plan to publish the language and their learnings in the near future.', 'National Express has had a focus on bringing more sustainable assets to its portfolio. Their aim is to go fully hydrogen/electric powered by 2030 and have been making headway with that. Sanchit added that they also plan to eliminate paper tickets completely, this will also solve some issues they‚Äôve had with fraudulent tickets.', 'Being a government-owned business means that LNER is aligned with governmental goals but they also plan to go beyond this. Danny said, ‚Äúthe ‚Äòpublic transport is more eco-friendly than cars‚Äô statement is a common trope for businesses similar to our‚Äôs to fall back on, but we‚Äôre going beyond that‚Äù.', 'Hanna stated that TfL has had sustainability at the core of every team. They are exploring how to reform the company to be more sustainable inside and out, really delving into and being strict with what they need. She said ‚Äòdo we really need post-it notes? Or even paper at all?‚Äô', 'At TfL, Hanna predicts that the trajectory they are on will continue and that both the cultural and operational changes are fundamental and will continue to evolve.', 'Danny said that senior management at LNER was having a long conversation about how to be more agile. He added that infamously the rail sector can be slow and dismissive of disruption and innovation but having looked at all the potential threats and opportunities for the future, they are rapidly becoming more agile and operationally innovative.', 'Looking to the future and potential international cooperation, National Express has been opening its doors to collaborations. This is happening externally with their partnership with Transport for West Midlands and internally with their expansion of MaaS projects to their international teams. Their goal is to bring better mobility options and freedom of choice to their customers. They‚Äôre also looking to invest more in sustainable assets like hydrogen-powered coaches and are this time of low traffic to experiment with new avenues.', 'Hanna added that their TfL Go app has made them invest more into improving their data. TfL has been a leader in having an open data policy and is well known for its open API but are looking to grow this by improving data points for incidents and addressing accessibility issues', 'Hanna: TfL is focussed on truly integrated, flexible and accessible mobility.', 'Danny: LNER is using collaboration to deliver innovation.', 'Sanchit: National Express is developing inventive services that will bring people back.', 'Watch the full discussion here.', 'Follow Futurice on LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook to stay connected.']",[]

In our interview he talks about the fundamental shift in the energy sector, the importance of data and IoT, and what is now most needed to run the energy system on renewables.\n', 'GreenCom connects distributed assets for energy providers. How do you see the importance and role of decentral structures for the energy sector?', 'Currently, we are witnessing a fundamental shift. For decades, we relied on the same infrastructure: Big power plants, a strong grid and everyone using the energy produced by those coal, nuclear or hydrogen plants. Today, things are changing rapidly.', ""Many countries strive towards CO2 neutrality and decided to phase out coal and nuclear power; several implanted means to boost decentral and green energy generation ‚Äì take, for instance, Germany's EEG. Apart from the visible political will, one can also notice private people taking great interest in brands like Tesla or Sonnen. Today, it is green and cool to participate in the energy transition. And finally, we see significant investments into green funds and companies ‚Äì take for instance Shell: as part of the company‚Äôs ambition to become a net-zero emissions energy company by 2050, they continue to grow their power business and investments in lower-carbon technologies and businesses that enable the energy transition. These three examples ‚Äì policy, private interest and investments -, show a greater trend: We are moving towards a more and more renewable and decentralised energy system."", 'Of course, not all energy generation will be decentralised. Offshore wind farms, hydrogen plants, and PV plants will produce large shares of the mix ‚Äì but with renewables being volatile, we will have to make both the demand and the generation side more flexible, needing battery technologies and intelligent software to manage all involved assets. In essence, decentral assets and their management are crucial to running the energy system on renewables.', 'How is data and IoT relevant for your business?', 'Both, data and IoT, are at the core of our business. Our energy IoT platform integrates and controls a large number of residential energy assets. It collects, harmonises, and processes thousands of data points in real time and enables our customers - utilities, OEMs and energy service companies - to provide reliable, sustainable and engaging services, such as home energy management, to their end customers.', ""An easy, reliable and cost-effective connection to all sorts of distributed assets such as PV inverters, batteries, wall boxes and heat pumps as well as smart meters poses one key enabler for our value proposition. And, given the heterogeneous asset landscape with hundreds of manufacturers and protocols, it also is a core strength of GreenCom Networks' IoT platform."", 'With renewables being volatile, we will have to make both the demand and the generation side more flexible, needing battery technologies and intelligent software to manage all involved assets. In essence, decentral assets and their management are crucial to running the energy system on renewables.', 'Which kind of problems are you typically solving as Head of Energy Communities for your customers?', ""As GreenCom Networks offers a white label Energy IoT platform, we are mostly active in B2B2C scenarios. Therefore, I am focusing on the challenges of our B2B customers, the utilities, OEM's and ESCO's, as well as customer needs on their end. Setting up a promising value proposition and concrete offer towards end customers is one thing I am helping our customers with. All this based on their business model, targeted solutions, and the specific regulations on energy communities in a given country as well as the technical capabilities of our IoT platform. Once a service or offering is in the market, it is essential to keep the end customers engaged, let them participate in the new energy world and show them how they can make a difference. To support this, we actively develop our web- and mobile apps further, to meet customers' demands."", 'Electrification of the mobility sector is creating new challenges for the energy sector. How can Smart Communities help to balance demand and supply?', ""The mobility sector's electrification has two major effects: higher total energy demand and more frequent peak demands. Firstly, every new electric vehicle that substitutes cars running on gasoline creates new, high electricity demand. And secondly, we expect an increased number of parallel charging sessions resulting in high loads placed on the network."", ""Here, smart communities can help mitigate the expected load peaks by intelligently controlling the charging processes. Also, controlling other devices with high power consumption, e.g., switching off heat pumps at peak load times, will further shave peaks. Finally, running a community for some time will reap additional benefits: The more historical data is available on the behaviour patterns of the members of a smart community, the better all integrated devices can be controlled and matched to the individual customers' requirements."", 'The Energy market in Germany is highly regulated - in which area do you think we need a change in regulation most urgently?', ""I'll limit my answer to a few points here: The expansion of renewable energies cannot be carried out to a sufficient extent through state investments alone but must be based on private sector investments as well. To support private investments in renewables, legislation should not put obstacles in the way of their expansion but facilitate their integration. Integration should be less complicated and, if necessary, promoted. For Germany specifically, it would be of great help if the statutory enablement of renewable energy communities required by the EU were implemented, as they are, e.g., in Spain, Austria and other EU countries.\nIn these countries, network charges, for example, are reduced or wholly cancelled if networks are conserved or not used through local consumption with simultaneous local, renewable generation. As a result, joint generation and consumption become economically more attractive, and investments in new photovoltaic systems, for example, are stimulated."", 'One trend in energy innovation projects in the last years was peer-to-peer approaches and Blockchain technology. What is your take on this?', ""As stated above, we strongly believe in the need to enable and promote a decentralised, renewable energy system by linking the relevant device classes and control them intelligently based on needs. This, naturally, includes the direct exchange of energy between prosumers and consumers in a local context. Can blockchain technology help here? It indeed has enormous potential, for example, offering increased security, but on the other hand also has disadvantages, like the energy intensity of the computing power required. We're curious to see the competitive advantage of the blockchain applied, and of course, we ensure to stay involved closely. Apart from that, we currently realise the real-time matching of generation and consumption using energy data that is stored and processed on our platform. This enables us to remunerate and invoice the producers and consumers of renewable energy accordingly, which is not really P2P, but close to it."", 'Looking into the future, what is the next problem you want to solve with GreenCom?', 'Although GreenCom has helped shape the renewable energy market for some time now, there is still a way to go before we see a predominantly decentralised energy world. The right targets are currently set for the local generation and demand for renewable energy, unfortunately not primarily in Germany. For me, helping set up local energy communities throughout Europe with easy understandable products and services and further developing our optimisation approaches is my focus.', 'About Henrik Schapp', '', ""Henrik Schapp combines experiences in Marketing, Communications and Product Management with a history of working in the renewables energy sector and the consumer software and services industry.

https://futurice.com/blog/how-we-co-created-our-tech-strategy,How we co-created our technology strategy ‚Äì and what we learned in the process,7 Jan 2021,Strategy,"In 2020, we set out to co-create our own technology strategy. Our approach was a highly participatory and inclusive process that involved dozens and dozens of people within the company and spanned less than three months from start to finish.","['From the high level to the day-to-day', 'Specialty areas', 'How we organized the process', ""What's next"", 'Takeaways']","['Building a strategy is always an involved process. This past fall, we took it upon ourselves to build a technology strategy for Futurice leading up to the year 2022. By structuring the work in a smart way, we were able to make it fairly easy on ourselves and complete it in less than three months. In addition to an actionable tech strategy, the process also yielded a ton of important lessons.', 'The primary focus of our strategy work was on the business landscape in Finland, but naturally many of the themes and trends around it are global. The main reason for building the strategy was to create clarity and focus, both for our people within the technology domain and others around it, like sales and HR, or HC as we like to call it ‚Äì short for Human Care.', 'Additionally, with a technology strategy in place, we are better equipped to take a stand on what we want to do and what we don‚Äôt. It also gives us a handy tool to help guide our focus and efforts in the long term, and conversely,  it will also be an instrument we can check retrospectively and see which bets we got right and which ones we didn‚Äôt. Having those insightful ""Hey, we nailed that one"" and ""Yeah, didn\'t see that coming"" moments.', 'In order for our tech strategy to do its job properly, we needed it to be an inspiring read for our technologists and touch their daily life at work. On the other hand, it would also have to be easy for our business people and other stakeholders to utilize in their work. Not exactly an easy task.', 'Our desired level of detail was set to be tangible enough to apply to everyday work, but not get all the way down to the nitty-gritty. We can expect to see lots of changes in tech over the next two years, so there‚Äôs little use trying to make guesses on an unnecessarily detailed level.', 'When creating our strategy, we wanted to get as much information from our tech community as possible. It was clear from the get-go that the strategy would be the culmination of our technological knowledge gathered from the community, and not just a handful of key people. All told, the process spanned little more than two calendar months and unfolded over the course of about 10 workshops of various sizes.', 'The strategy was designed to work on all levels from the bird‚Äôs-eye view all the way to more specific grassroots items with the level of technical details increasing when moving from the higher-level items to more detailed issues, like the use of TypeScript in frontend development. The transition from ""fluffier"" themes towards the hardcore technology landscape felt natural and gave our strategy more structure.', '\nFigure 1: A gradual transition from high level items to technical details', 'First, we needed to align our technology strategy with our wider, company level strategy. We did this by binding our company level items to technological items on the country level to create a natural progression. At the same time, this also helped outline what kind of projects we take on, and with what kinds of teams. And so, the basis for the rest of our technology strategy was set.', 'Next up, we created a country level vision for our technology business. One can always argue whether this is necessary, but we felt that there was a need for a simple and concise statement that encapsulates what we stand for:', 'Inspire our clients to use technology in creative ways to solve complex problems for their customers, employees and society at large.', 'And building on the above statement, we also defined a set of principles that we see as overarching guidelines of how we want to run our technology practice. This step takes us closer towards concrete things. The roughly dozen items on that list contain statements like:', 'Our technology choices are guided by feasibility, maintainability, and business rationale. We enable people to evolve within the tech domain and outside of it.', 'Many of these are things that go without saying, but putting them in writing makes them more effective and something we can use for guidance when making decisions in the future.', 'Naturally, a strategy also requires us to have goals. These goals are something we should be able to reach with the right actions. They describe our desired state in market position, people development, partnerships and the kinds of projects we do. Since these are long-term items, they require incremental progression to reach them. This progression happens through concrete actions within all of our specialty areas ‚Äì hence the next and most concrete part of the strategy, specialty areas.', '\nFigure 2: Inputs to the strategy, its alignment outside the tech domain, and use after the process', 'The various areas we cover technology-wise is massive, and basically extends from mobile to cloud infrastructure, and everything in-between. To make the work more manageable we ended up splitting it into these specialties:', ""Naturally, there is lots of overlap between all of these ‚Äì for example, consider Firebase, which can land either on Cloud, Web development or Mobile development. When such issues came up, we simply made an educated judgement call. For the end result, it didn't really matter which side of the fence the items were on."", 'In that list of specialties, two areas ‚Äì Partnerships and Tech community ‚Äì stand out as slightly different from the rest, but both nonetheless involve analysis of our current state and include focus points for the next two years.', 'Each specialty needed to reflect on three main points:', ""Again, we wanted these topics to give us a nice flow. The first step would be to look at where we are now with a CSA-type of approach. We did this by analyzing our data on what kind of skills our people have and what we've been using in our projects. This gave us a good picture on where we are and where the market is at regarding the specialties. This yielded us insights like:"", 'In front-end development, we have 195 people skilled with React and the most common choice in our projects is React with TypeScript. In web development, we are experts at building complex, high-performing and scalable web applications like the Sanoma News Platform.', 'We then started researching global trends, our clients‚Äô future needs and our own views on where the world would be going. The goal here was to create a clear and focused outlook from the point of view of technology-enabled business. Naturally we tried not to embrace the whole world and instead stay focused on technology in our context. On the other hand, this also meant technology in almost all business verticals ‚Äì which is not exactly a small focus... This gave us outputs like:', 'While in most cases APIs serve a specific purpose and it may not be necessary or even desirable to centralize everything, there is a clear trend towards a more structured API development strategy.', 'After compiling these two parts it was finally time to make choices on where to focus based on the background work done so far. This part also included choosing where not to focus.', 'The growing need from our clients to move their on-premises monoliths to serverless cloud environments also requires us to keep building our capabilities in that area.', 'The final result was a package that described what to do next as well as the background behind that decision.', 'The building blocks that eventually made up the core insights within each specialty area, as well as the underlying trends, were generated by assigning people the responsibility to facilitate the process under each specialty area, and gather information from our technology community and other sources.', 'In practice, this meant looking into lots of data sources and workshopping with the relevant people. In the end, the results were distilled into a more condensed format, while all the material that went into them and was created during the process, like slides, documents, Miro boards etc. were of course stored for future reference. Once all the specialties were packaged, it was a question of doing a once-over and checking that everything was aligned, logical and made sense business-wise.', '\nFigure 3: Involving people outside the core team benefits the knowledge gathering phase', 'Our approach was highly participatory, and it involved dozens and dozens of contributors from across the company. A big part of why we did it this way was to be inclusive throughout the process. Managing contributions from a large number of participants always runs the risk of devolving into a sprawling mess, but we were able to avoid this by introducing precisely the right amount of structure ‚Äì not too rigid, but chaotic either.', 'Looking back, I feel that this was by far the leanest strategy process I have ever been involved with, but at the same time, we ended up with a very clear and usable document going forward. It will also be an important input for planning our future activities around recruitment, training and business.', 'In its plainest version, a strategy is just a document in a cloud folder. That is why the road that took us there was already important in and of itself, having involved multitude of technologists and business people. Right now, we are in the process of planning the actions based on the strategy, and agreeing on them with all the stakeholders within the company. To ensure the planned actions are executed, they will be a part of our quarterly OKRs on the country and/or team level.', 'To remain agile, we will have strategy reviews every six months. The changes in technology never stop, so we need to assess what we have been doing and adjust accordingly. Now that the strategy is already in place, adjustments are much easier to make.', 'As a byproduct of this work, we have spun off the Futurice Tech Trends 2021‚Äì2022 report from the strategy work, and made it into a standalone website and document that describe the driving technology trends affecting our business and that of our clients. Definitely an interesting read for anyone working in the technology industry.', 'If this raised any comments or questions, please get in touch ‚Äì I‚Äôm happy to tell you more about our approach, and also offer help as you craft your organization‚Äôs tech strategy!']","['Web development (frontend and backend)', 'Mobile development', 'Data science and data engineering', 'Cloud and architecture', 'Technology in the business context', 'Agile delivery', 'Partnerships', 'Tech community', 'What are we good at now and where do we have room for improvement?', 'What trends affect us globally and through our clients?', 'What should we focus on for the next two years?', 'Start with the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù.

Read more about the current status of digital health in Germany in our interview with Dr. Anne Sophie Geier.', 'Spitzenverband Digitale Gesundheitsversorgung e.V. is an expert network of e-health providers and ambassadors in Germany. Which challenges are particularly relevant to your network members at the moment?', 'There are many topics on the agenda for 2021. From our perspective, the main focus for all players in the healthcare sector will be on the further development of the processes and structures that have been created. Several new regulations are expected or come into practice, both at national and European level. In May, the European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) will be the new standard which will be of great relevance for many manufacturers. In addition, the new Digitale Versorgung und Pflege-Modernisierungs Gesetz (DVPMG) is in the making and will most likely lead to new regulations regarding data security and other fields. On the other hand, we still face the challenge that a lot of patients, physicians and psychotherapists don‚Äôt know about new digital solutions such as DiGA - so one of our main goals is to inform about these new opportunities in health care.', 'Let‚Äôs look at the current status of Digital Health in Germany. Where do you think are we on the digital health journey in Germany, and why?', 'What is particularly important from my point of view is the great progress we have been able to achieve in 2020. The legal framework provided with the Digitale Versorgung Gesetz has paved the way for digital health applications (DHA) to become an integral part of standard care. This is a milestone for the digitalization of the German healthcare system but only a first step. We need more digital health solutions, e.g. in the care sector and most importantly, we need to really learn how to integrate them in our existing healthcare system.', 'What do you feel would be the next steps to overcome some of these barriers?', 'At the moment, there are ten DHAs listed in the directory of the Bundesinstitut f√ºr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte. Our experience is that DiGAs are slowly finding their way into standard care because many patients and providers still lack the necessary information. So, we need to provide these important information through various webinars and educational training and support digital health literacy of patients and all other stakeholders. Most importantly, we need to establish user friendly processes to add value and foster life quality - this is a key goal of digitalization of the health care sector.', 'In what ways does the regulatory environment in Germany need to change to promote digital health applications?', 'What we need are clear and reliable structures and a set of rules that everyone can rely on. For example, companies need to know how the regulations regarding data protection in Europe and Germany are understood by the authorities to plan accordingly. With Jens Spahn we have a minister that really sees the advantages of a more digitized healthcare system and wants to shape it on the foundation of our rules in Germany and Europe.', 'The legal framework provided with the Digitale Versorgung Gesetz is a milestone for the digitalization of the German healthcare system but only a first step. We need more digital health solutions and most importantly, we need to really learn how to integrate them in our existing health care system.', 'What course must be set to allow healthcare companies to successfully use data networks to improve the treatment of patients?', 'There are already many examples of healthcare startups and companies working for example with Artificial Intelligence - they rely on high quality databases for further research and improvement. With this knowledge, there is a huge potential for the future of medicine. On the regulatory level, we are facing new developments in 2021 like the electronic patient record, which connects patients with doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies. It thus enables the exchange of relevant information from different areas of care. And we definitely need a discussion in the future about the question of who should be allowed to use anonymized data for specific health care questions.', 'Looking at the overall health landscape - more and more startups are entering the field of digital healthcare. Where do you see the biggest opportunities for startups and how do you support them?', ""There are so many areas in healthcare where digital solutions can be helpful because we are facing major changes: an aging society, increasingly complex care sector, migration to the cities and thus a lack of care in rural areas. We need solutions to these challenges, for example, in the networking of service providers. Especially innovative startups can be a big part of the solution.  As SVDGV, we support with a high exchange of knowledge. But we also bundle everyone's interests and bring them to the attention of stakeholders from politics, health insurance companies and others. We are open as a partner to present the challenges of the companies and startups. In doing so, we are open, transparent, and always ready for a dialog."", 'When envisioning the future, looking at 5 years from now, what do you think will be your most used digital healthcare solution?', 'It‚Äôs not important what will be the most used digital healthcare solution. What matters is that we are successful in developing digital tools that can really improve the quality of healthcare. There is a lot of optimism in the healthcare community, and we can definitely feel it in many different ways. Policymakers have set strategically important milestones and thus brought new momentum to the digitization of the healthcare industry.

They offer not only tangible benefits for prosumers and new businesses, but also unleash new opportunities for incumbents who anticipate changes in market dynamics.","['The basic principles of energy communities', 'Decentralized energy markets', 'Energy self-reliance', 'Local building projects', 'Is there a place for traditional energy companies in a world of decentralized energy markets?']","['The energy industry is witnessing an interesting shift as decentralized energy markets are emerging to fill a growing niche in the ecosystem. For many prosumers and businesses, they offer tangible benefits ‚Äì but there are also some reservations related to certain consumer preferences as well as incumbent energy companies‚Äô interests. But just how justified are these concerns, exactly?', 'As the energy sector witnesses the rise of energy communities and a more decentralized market, a large number of homeowners and companies have the option to invest in their own production and storage capabilities to become less reliant on traditional energy suppliers. At the same time, a considerable number of people living in apartment buildings have felt excluded from the change and its benefits.', 'Similarly, many traditional energy companies see the transition as a direct threat to parts of their business. While decentralized energy markets don‚Äôt necessarily put these companies‚Äô entire existence at risk, it is likely to cost them some of their revenue and even compromise the current positions of some market-leading companies.', 'Luckily for consumers, the true risk of disenfranchisement isn‚Äôt quite as bleak as it may seem thanks to energy communities that unlock opportunities for individuals to participate in the energy transition by investing in decentralized assets. And as with any shift in the marketplace, new developments also unleash new opportunities for incumbents who anticipate changes in market dynamics.', 'The core concept of an energy community is to bring supply and demand closer together. Ideally, everyone involved will benefit from each other without an intermediary or a central wholesale market. The platforms that connect an energy community rely heavily on data and AI, automated processes and smart contracts, and some also use blockchain technology.', 'The topic is mainly present in the following contexts:', 'P2P energy communities enable people to take control of where and how they want to buy electricity and heating. As a consumer, one can give parameters such as, ‚ÄúI want to get electricity preferably from my uncle‚Äôs and my neighbors‚Äô solar panels, and I also want to buy at a cheaper rate than my current supplier‚Äôs standard tariff.‚Äù', 'These parameters and the associated consumption profile are then handed over to a virtual agent that handles the supply, trading consumption and documentation for the end-user. The idea is to remove as much complexity as possible, and enable formerly passive consumers to become an active part of a community of consumers, producers and prosumers.', 'One example of what a decentralized market could look like can be seen with D3A, a decentralized energy exchange engine from Grid Singularity. Demands and consumption profiles can be matched and the needs of different actors can be aggregated through the platform.', 'This setup can solve problems like demand response for small entities, but also help deal with demand response on a larger scale. Energy communities can solve problems like grid balance on a local base by building microgrid structures, or form alliances over distributed assets based on data, automated processes and smart contracts.', 'There is also an interesting question related to regulations and pricing ‚Äì namely, how will different actors be compensated for offering their flexibility or production and storage capacities for others. If you can match supply and demand within a local distribution grid, you could easily argue in favor of a reduction in grid fees compared to electricity that has to be transported and transformed over long distances. Current regulation doesn‚Äôt allow for these kinds of discounts.', 'Another question in this direction is how communities can benefit from lower prices, and whether they are allowed to offer those. Whenever wind farms and solar panels generate too much electricity, a community with extra storage capacity could for example help charge batteries or produce green hydrogen.', 'The industry needs a legal framework that allows more flexibility in pricing, such as dynamic prices or flat rates and bonuses. On the European level, legislators have already started the discussion, and the first government-subsidised projects around decentralized energy communities are being tested at the moment.', 'For an average family household, a set of consumer-grade solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and power storage equipment can help increase the degree of self-reliance, or autarky, to roughly 70 percent over the course of a year. The German startup sonnen offers its clients the option to cover the remaining 30 percent through a tariff option called sonnenCommunity. This community consists of other PV-equipped homeowners with storage, and an unknown amount of energy that sonnen as an energy trader either buys on the wholesale market or produces with other decentralized assets. For heating, a similar model could be established by adding heat pumps to the home energy center. The more energy consuming or storing entities can be aggregated and steered centrally based on data the more significant the market power of an energy community.', 'For traditional energy companies, the recent pairing between the electricity and mobility industries is introducing a set of new competitors as well as risks. Several automotive companies are on their way to becoming commodity vendors for electricity and mobility. Tesla‚Äôs sunroof to storage (using refurbished car batteries) solution, EV charging option based on a wallbox at home, as well as the company‚Äôs wider Supercharger network constitute the first attempt to cover the entire value chain of electricity and mobility.', 'Other car manufacturers like VW and Audi are following the example, apart from offering the production side ‚Äì at least so far. Energy producers, on the other hand, are looking into partnerships with car manufacturers and mobility solutions, especially companies with an EV fleet management element. The additional storage capacity introduced by EVs is an important factor for energy communities looking to help manage supply and demand.', 'Manufacturing businesses could also be interesting actors in energy communities. Many manufacturing companies have invested in their energy production and storage capabilities in order to reduce their operating costs and their CO2 footprint. Given that these companies do not operate their machines 24/7, there will be times when they could sell their overcapacity to the market or an energy community that can help find a suitable partner based on real-time data.', 'Over the past few years, ‚Äúplus-energy‚Äù buildings and the use of waste energy have been active topics of discussion. Building projects like the Audi IN-Campus use waste heat from data centers to heat apartments and office spaces on the campus. During summer, the spaces could be cooled using heating pumps. A steady heat buyer such as a swimming pool or a washing center would be even more efficient. In Stockholm, new legislation obligates data center operators to feed their waste heat into the district heating grid. Estimates say that up to 10 percent of the heating demand in Stockholm could be met with waste heat from data centers by 2035.', 'Energy communities could play an important role in financing building projects that involve energy production and storage capabilities. Higher costs for energy-efficient building components could be refinanced with the revenue that will be generated with energy production in the coming years. Community-based financing models could also allow people to buy a share of e.g. a PV or wind farm, either as a pure investment product or to compensate for their own consumption with a guaranteed output per year. In cases like these, operating and insurance costs could be shared between the operator and the community.', 'These Energy-as-a-Service or Storage-as-a-Service models are relatively uncharted territory and will inevitably give rise to a need for new regulation, incentives and taxation. Demand, delivery and consumption tracking is crucial in order to make this concept work, which means that all properties, including private households, should have smart meters in place ‚Äì which is still not a standard in some countries in Europe.', 'Part of the value of an energy community is the aggregated data that it can use to buy, sell or consume energy as one entity. Aggregation of data could also give rise to a whole ecosystem of players around energy communities, such as OEMs for production and storage units, spare parts, and personnel needed for asset installation and maintenance. In practice, energy communities could be organized in relatively small entities, for example local operators and microstructures. To amplify their impact, energy communities should be designed so that they can share information and collaborate if they share common interests.', 'The concept of energy communities may initially sound like a losing proposition for traditional energy companies, but does the trend mean they will inevitably go the way of the dinosaur? Not necessarily, if they play their cards right.', 'For a while now, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have sparked ideas around decentralized energy markets. The core idea of taking out the middleman (i.e. banks) is not going to work the same way for energy markets. Grid companies, maintenance services and taxes will remain part of the market, and by extension, the price of energy. But if energy communities can help solve problems and bridge the gap towards a more sustainable carbon neutral energy supply, they should also be granted special conditions.', 'It‚Äôs entirely possible that energy communities could seize a corner of the market from traditional energy suppliers, especially if they get the benefit of favorable regulation in the next few years. But even that would still leave incumbents plenty of space to work with.', 'One reason why traditional energy suppliers are particularly interested in decentralized energy markets is that they see plenty of business potential in platform ownership. By becoming the administrator or platform owner of an energy community, energy companies could benefit from the trend and incorporate their own assets as fundamental parts of the community. Additionally, it enables them to integrate other players, such as mobility operators, creating long-term value for customers and building loyalty with their help. Also ‚Äì even if more and more decentralized markets pop up, it is not unreasonable to guess that many consumers will still be quite happy with the status quo and at least initially stick with their current energy supplier, simply because it is more convenient.', 'With growing energy prices and an increasing demand for affordable clean energy, the motivation to become an active player on the energy market could change. Decentralized markets and energy communities will gain traction if the financial benefits can be shared between the members. As energy markets change, energy communities could be one important part in tackling problems such as demand response and grid balance, and help bridge the gap when transitioning from fossil to renewable energy.', 'As with most emerging and potentially disruptive trends, it‚Äôs a question of when we‚Äôll see energy communities‚Äô impact on the status quo, not if. How extensively they will affect the business of incumbent players depends on their ability to capitalize on the shift and adapt to the changing market landscape. In order to convince customers, this needs to happen on their terms ‚Äì lower prices are a good start, but acceptance also requires demands that the new services adapt to the needs of users and to be easy to use.', 'Interested in changing energy markets?

What is their secret? To find out, let‚Äôs take a look at some rules we‚Äôve found useful in practice at two companies we‚Äôve had the privilege of working with, Fortum and VR Group.', 'Connecting data from different sources to improve visibility can provide significant business value. Information produced using AI and advanced analytics helps make better decisions and improve preparedness by simulating different what-if scenarios. Furthermore, when routine tasks are automated, and decentralized actions are enabled through personalized views, daily operations become more efficient. But achieving these benefits requires understanding and commitment. To create business value with new technologies, organizations must start with three key questions:', 'Let‚Äôs look at the best practices we utilized in two cases we‚Äôve worked on: VR‚Äôs Ohjus, a situational awareness system for better commuter train disruption management, and Fortum‚Äôs Apollo, an interface solution for improved visibility of optimization results that improves the planning of hydroelectric power production.', 'At both VR and Fortum, using data and advanced analytics are based on and guided by the business vision: VR wanted to provide more reliable rail service, and Fortum wanted more environmentally and economically efficient hydroelectric power production. In both cases, understanding the user and customer needs was the key to finding problems worth solving with data. Understanding the interaction between the model and the user is important, especially when developing an analytics model to support experts in decision-making.', 'Being able to calculate return-on-investment is important. ‚ÄúBefore we started, we estimated the monetary value of the expected benefits. Then we compared that to the expected costs, and built the business case around that‚Äù, says Tuomas Pyykk√∂nen, Hydro Planning Expert at Fortum. As for budgeting, Antti Kleemola, CDO at VR Group, advises: ‚ÄúTransform your legacy IT to free funds from traditional IT to digitizing your business. Separate traditional IT from digital capabilities.‚Äù', 'At VR, the people who use the Ohjus system are not driven by technology or data. We must understand that the end-users have their own responsibilities, daily routines and problems to solve. Keeping this in mind, we shared the vision and actively engaged the people in Ohjus system development process from the beginning. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always easier to get people connected to a vision that they themselves have been a part of...Organizations‚Äô ability to change is the key, not the technology‚Äù, Kleemola adds. At Fortum, business and IT people worked together from the start.', 'A multidisciplinary team is responsible for the end-to-end process - from understanding the end-user problem to direct business value for end-users: what is being solved and what expertise is needed to solve it. For each organization, we co-formed multidisciplinary and agile core teams responsible for the whole data lifecycle, thus producing direct business value for the end-users.', 'Business goals are best achieved when people are able to solve problems together. The effective, multi-skilled teams at VR and Fortum share their skills in a variety of ways to work towards the shared vision.', 'The lean and agile development of data and analytics services creates business value quickly and incrementally. As in other digital services, data and analytics solutions should be developed in phases, starting with a design sprint and followed by a data science proof-of-concept and then building a minimum viable product (MVP), etc. Collecting immediate feedback throughout the development process by actively engaging with end-users is essential. This helps avoid false assumptions and enables the implementation of user-centred services - sooner rather than later.', '‚ÄúGetting early feedback from end-users testing the mock-up has been important for us ... as was the early prototyping of technical approaches, using amounts of data similar to real-life situations,‚Äù Pyykk√∂nen says. When solutions are iterated in stages, the probability of success increases and risks decrease.', 'The primary challenge in harnessing data for operational use usually comes from the number of interlinked systems and data sources. This is why we recommend creating lean end-to-end solutions for the identified business needs, one at a time. When only the necessary cloud-based tools are added, and data is made usable and actionable through well designed and visualized user interfaces, the approach enables data flows on top of existing cloud and heritage systems, without complex integrations or implementation projects.', 'Data and analytics solutions are never done and continuous development is essential in rapidly changing business environments. ‚ÄúThe next natural step is to expand from this first version. Scaling the concept means that we can bring more use cases to the same concept. By expanding the coverage, we can provide expansions on cargo and long distance trains. Making the system smarter means creating both more sophisticated solutions for our users and more precise actions. Finally, we‚Äôll  use automation to further improve system efficiency,‚Äú Kleemola explains. In addition to mid-term horizon hydro optimization, the Apollo approach at Fortum provides valuable experiences and concepts that can be applied and refined further to benefit other development areas, too. Thanks to lean and agile methods, the teams are always ready for change.', 'Watch our Smart Operations webinar recording with Fortum and VR and get inspired', 'Get more insight on VR`s and Fortum case studies:', 'Fortum Apollo', 'VR Ohjus']","['What are our most important business needs?', 'How do we inspire and engage our people to use data and advanced analytics?', 'What is essential in developing new systems?']"

When the pandemic hit, we, like everyone else, faced a totally new world and had to start rethinking how we embrace our community and the value it brings to the everyday life of our people and the business.', 'Right off, we knew we can‚Äôt just put everything on hold and wait for the pandemic to blow over before going back to normal and our regular community action.  We wanted to create a strong base for a world-class hybrid community and that wasn‚Äôt going to doesn‚Äôt happen in a blink of an eye. It requires constant work, deep rethinking, and trial and error.', 'Personally, I‚Äôm glad we didn‚Äôt just sit and wait, because this year has taught us a lot about the value of community and how to strengthen it in difficult times.', 'We immediately made working to strengthen our community an internal priority for this new reality. For three quarters, community matters have been an important aspect of our Human Care team OKRs, with different groups of people working together in changing teams on a variety of topics.', 'Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve learned during this year of trial and error.', 'Talking about caring for the people means nothing if it‚Äôs not backed up by action. That‚Äôs where care really matters. This year we have, for example, contacted every single one of our employees to see how they are doing under these extraordinary circumstances. We sent several care packages, some for the whole company, some for employees at specific sites. Contents have included, for example, face masks, chocolate and coffee.', 'Sometimes it‚Äôs the small things that make all the difference.', 'Communities need space, a frame. It can occur on a number of different levels - for discussion: a chat channel; for detailed discussion about a particular subject: a channel dedicated to that subject; for a meeting: a shared online video call.', 'If an important frame for interaction has previously been talking with your colleagues by the coffee machine, and the possibility to do so is taken away, you need a new frame. It could be 10 dedicated minutes at the end of every meeting. Or an open remote coffee break. The space for interaction needs to be created.', 'Once you‚Äôve created the space, don‚Äôt be afraid to tinker with the formula, because few things work forever. Take the coffee break - at the start of the pandemic we had a daily coffee break on one of our sites. It worked for the first two months, but then nobody showed up anymore. After reducing it to twice a week, numbers increased a bit, but soon dropped again. The latest version is an open coffee break once a week and a themed coffee break once a week. Numbers have increased significantly.', 'Learning: the narrower the frame, more tangible it feels to many. The different themes attract different groups.', 'Every single one of us has experienced confusion during the changes this year has brought. There‚Äôs no end to the questions our current circumstances bring up, many related to what is or isn‚Äôt acceptable under these circumstances: ‚ÄúAm I allowed to do this while remote? How should I do that? And how about that other thing?‚Äù', 'Saying even the smallest things out loud is essential.', 'Tell people if it‚Äôs ok to have dedicated time for chit chat during meetings. Say it out loud if it‚Äôs okay to go for a walk and have a meeting via your phone and headphones. Tell employees if it‚Äôs okay to spend money on remote team events.', 'Sharing examples of community events may have a huge inspirational value. Seeing what other small groups are doing to activate their people easily gets people thinking: ‚ÄúOh, that team did it like that‚Ä¶ should we too?‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat team has that kind of process in place. Should we have one, too?‚Äù', 'Share what you do and share how you do it. Be clear. Be concrete.', 'For example, we created completely new pages for our intranet called ‚ÄúRemote Life‚Äù. It includes guidelines, communications materials, support material for remote life with kids, tips on remote afterworks and activities, and case examples. The page is co-created together with our employees - and this takes us to the last but maybe most important part.', 'Even though our human care team worked on this topic a lot, sense of belonging and community are not built from the outside or top down. It grows bottom up.', 'Our focus has been on creating space and enabling the community to live on this new hybrid and remote surface.

The topic of designing products for men as the norm when it comes to users, whilst treating women as an exception (or ignoring them altogether!) was a topic close to my heart ever since I was studying at University. It was about time I got to do something about it in working life! As I had time in between projects, I helped to plan a Solution Creation Jam for Futurice employees as a part of the Girls Take Over day. Futurice made a commitment to take one of the outcomes from the jam and turn it into a real pro-bono project. In order to choose which idea would become a real project, we decided to make it a pitching competition. Plan shared with us reports on a selection of issues related to girls and technology, including references and some solution suggestions. We synthesized the research reports into three briefs for Futuriceans who signed up to take part and form groups to tackle the issues.', 'Male-majority / All-male teams creating services and products for diverse users', 'Up to this point, men have been steering the development of the new digital solutions that influence society and culture, with limited contributions from women.', 'Gender biased data & algorithms', 'Bias in / bias out, -the outputs from algorithms can only be as good as the data they are based on and as unbiased as their creators.', 'Technology - a girl‚Äôs dream job?', 'Why are there so few female developers in the tech industry? We are often told that ‚ÄúThere are not enough qualified candidates.‚Äù Is it really so?', 'Here is a little synthesis of the problem areas:', 'Have you ever heard of the ‚Äòpink tax‚Äô? This phenomena synthesizes the issue rather well: objects are designed for men and as that design is altered for women the price increases and the product colour changes to pink. An example of this would be making power tools for women by not taking into account that women have smaller hands to comfortably hold the tools in order to operate them fluently, but rather making the tool with the same measurements in pink and offering it as a women‚Äôs version. The phenomena isn‚Äôt as new as one might think: Dodge tried to appeal to female consumers with a pink car that came with a matching rain coat, an umbrella, and a makeup case already back in the 1950s. The design didn‚Äôt take into account actual important female needs like safety. Up to the current day women are still 47% more likely than men to get serious injuries in a car crash as most of the crash test dummies used are based on male bodies. (Invisible Women, Caroline Criado Perez, 2019)', 'Research conducted at the University of Washington on Google‚Äôs widely used speech-recognition software found that it is almost 70 percent more likely to accurately recognize male speech than female speech. When Siri was first launched, it also couldn‚Äôt recognize female voices as well as those of men. As the Apple health app was first launched, it didn‚Äôt include period tracking. Women are more likely to feel nauseous when using VR devices as male and female balance systems are different, and the list goes on. (Invisible Women, Caroline Criado Perez, 2019)', 'Forgetting female needs is also bad for business. Who would buy a game that makes them nauseous? Why would you invest in any devices with speech recognition if you have the frustrating experience of repeating yourself many times before being understood?', 'If new technology is primarily developed and tested by men, it is likely to better serve men‚Äôs needs. This results in  more and more young girls feeling that technology is not for them, thus putting them off studying tech related subjects -and we have a vicious  circle.', 'The lack of diversity in technology can have a serious multiplier effect as data, algorithms and AI become influential in day-to-day life. Artificial intelligence is now used to automate decision-making across the board, from the healthcare industry to the legal system, and may be responsible for making choices that affect people‚Äôs whole life trajectory, such as which medical treatment they receive, whether they are eligible for life insurance or a loan, or which jobs they are invited to interview for. When deep learning systems are trained on data that contain gender biases, these biases are reproduced in the software. Amazon‚Äôs AI recruiting software, for example, was found to downgrade resumes that contained the word ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs‚Äô, as in ‚Äòwomen‚Äôs chess club captain‚Äô, because it had been trained on men‚Äôs resumes. (Reuters 11.10.2018)', 'Let‚Äôs take a closer look at healthcare and medical data. If the collected data isn‚Äôt taking gender into account, the consequences can be fatal for women. According to research conducted in the UK, women are 50% more likely to have their heart attacks misdiagnosed than men. In 2016, the British Medical Journal published a research finding that young women are almost twice as likely to die in hospital after having a heart attack than men. Women are more likely to have their conditions misdiagnosed because their symptoms are not ‚Äòtypical‚Äô  - and that means typical male symptoms. Their symptoms might not be seen as severe enough to receive treatment because what is seen as  severe is different for male and female bodies, and research is generally conducted on males. Typical female symptoms aren‚Äôt as widely taught or recognised. Women‚Äôs bodies also react to vaccines and medication differently. Still, human and animal males are used more in medical trials even when researching medications for illnesses that occur more often in women. This leaves women for example more likely to experience arrhythmia from medicines. How will a woman‚Äôs experience of getting a diagnosis and appropriate medication change as doctors lean more and more on biased data and algorithms when making medical decisions? Improving the quality of data in this kind of context could vastly improve women‚Äôs lives and potentially even save them. \n(Invisible Women, Caroline Criado Perez, 2019)', ""We can already see the marketing of technology and items thought of as technical, in childhood. A walk through boys' and girls' clothing or toy sections at a store is a wake-up call, when you start thinking about how certain things are aimed at certain children. Adults subconsciously (or consciously) place different expectations for boys and girls and children are vulnerable to pick up on that. There is plenty of data showing that closer to puberty, girls stop being interested in mathematics. Gender stereotypes don‚Äôt only hurt girls, but leave young boys with a narrow norm to fit into that might even lead to giving up friendships. (HS Poikien puolella 14.4.20)"", 'Research shows that by adulthood women have learned to subconsciously filter certain job posts as not suitable for them based on masculine language. (Invisible Women, Caroline Criado Perez, 2019) How do we talk about tech as a career? How is it marketed? For example Facebook uses racial and gender stereotypes in their targeted marketing, which might lead to a situation where a young man and women see very different advertisements for career options. (CNBC 2019) The findings of the Swedish Youth Barometer study (Ungdomsbarometern, 2015), which surveyed 8,000 young people‚Äôs self-image in technology found that only 7% of the technology-interested girls describe themselves as technical, compared with 36% of the technology-interested boys, but that 23% of the technology-interested girls describe themselves as creative. Creativity is a key part of problem solving and creating digital technologies is by its very nature a creative process.', 'If a girl ends up choosing STEM studies and getting a place at a technical University, the chances are still high that she will not end up working with tech. Research has shown that women end up dropping out of STEM studies because of discrimination, competitiviness and lack of female peers. (EQUALS & UNESCO, 23-24) The recent news about the culture of some of the technical Universities‚Äô societies in Finland have highlighted several of these issues. It is perhaps then not surprising that many women do not feel welcome in these institutions where older male students try to get the female freshers drunk to have a laugh at their expense. (HS, Nyt 2.12.20)', 'As Criado Perez writes in her book, once a woman actually starts a career in tech the struggle isn‚Äôt over. People are more likely to hire people that seem to fit the current crowd, are somehow known in the network and that the recruiters feel connected or similar to. This often leaves women worse off in the interviews. Research has also found  that the people who think that they are objective and not sexist are more likely to actually not be objective and be sexist. Despite multiple research findings that show recruiting without knowing gender leads to hiring more women, interviewing is still the typical way to select employees. Coding used to be women‚Äôs work in the defence industry. When it became more associated with mathematics and the appreciation and salaries started to rise, men took over the careers. (Invisible Women, Caroline Criado Perez, 2019)', 'Women also leave tech jobs more easily. According to research conducted in the USA, 40% of women resign within 10 years compared to 17% of men working with technology. According to the Center of Talent Innovation women didn‚Äôt leave the field because they didn‚Äôt enjoy the work, but because of the atmosphere at work, discouraging managers or because of lack of career progression. (Invisible Women, Caroline Criado Perez, 2019) Furthermore according to the State of European Technologies (2018), as many as 46% of the women surveyed reported to have experienced discrimination in the tech sector. Women are also are more likely than men to cite gender bias, discrimination and harassment as their reason for leaving the field. (EQUALS & UNESCO, 25) (Plan 2019, 22) According to research conducted in the USA where 248 American IT companies‚Äô job evaluations were analysed, it turned out that women face personal criticisms that men don‚Äôt. Several studies show that white men are more likely to get rises and bonuses than women or employees from ethnic minorities. (Invisible Women, Caroline Criado Perez, 2019) Transparency in career rises, levels and bonuses is a key to solving this problem so women don‚Äôt leave because of the comparatively lower salaries. Having processes in place to support women experiencing harassment at work is crucial to wellbeing.', 'So, these were the challenges we were presented with. How about the solutions? We had very hard working teams representing different competences ideating for solutions to the briefs, validating them with a teen-aged female user, a pitching session where our two CEOs - Teemu Moisala and the 18 year old CEO-for-a-day Jessica Komulainen - asked questions and selected the winner. Even with the jam held remotely using video calls, Miro boards and other collaboration tools, the energy and motivation remained high throughout the day.', 'The winning solution was an answer to the problem of all male teams creating services and products for diverse users. As the Futurice Lean Service Creation toolkit is already widely in use, the team proposed making edits to it that will prompt solution creators to think whether their research and testing pools are diverse enough and whether they might have missed some insights or problems because of not taking diversity into account. The next step would be to create a diversity and inclusion toolkit and then a platform for matching potential users and solution creators.', 'Our other team focused on the challenge of getting more girls to study for, and take up careers in tech. Their idea was to create a platform that represents many of the roles that are available in the field of technology. The aim was to help girls make a connection to how their interests could be leveraged to find an inspiring career in the field of technology. Both of the concept ideas were handed to Plan as open source so that anyone can take them forward.', 'As the next step, Futurice will review and update the canvas sets. All of us involved in the Plan Girls Take Over Day certainly learned a lot! I would like to encourage any company to critically think about how they are working on improving diversity and inclusion.

To help us take concrete steps on this journey, we decided to participate in Plan International‚Äôs Girls Takeover initiative. The highlight of Girls Takeover was having a new CEO for a day - then 18-year-old Jessica Komulainen.', 'Futurice is committed to celebrating diversity and building an inclusive workplace where everyone has equitable opportunities and feels a sense of belonging. Being a technology company, increasing our gender balance is one of the key diversity dimensions - although not the only one - we need to improve on. Our D&I ambition is three-fold: we aim to be a completely inclusive workplace; we want to be the first choice for tech women; and we want to have leadership teams that mirror the diversity of our organisation.', 'My name is Jessica Komulainen. I just turned 19 a few weeks ago. I grew up in a multicultural society with my Chinese grandparents in Malaysia and moved to Sotkamo at the age of five. Now I am studying to be a forestry engineer at the Karelia University of Applied Sciences. I love outdoor activities and sports and I also enjoy meeting people.', 'I was very shy as a young girl. My parents enrolled me in the scouts when I was nine. I was reluctant at first, but gradually fell in love with it! Through the scouts, I developed my confidence and learned that girls and boys are similar  in many ways. This message of equality is also practiced in my home.', 'Growing up in Finland, I feel lucky to have the same opportunities as boys to pursue what I love, including a profession historically dominated by men. I joined the Girls Takeover Day (GTD) to show girls around the world that they can chase their dreams too, and should be given the same opportunities as boys. This year‚Äôs theme, ‚ÄòGirls and Technology‚Äô, affected me personally. When I was in high school, my girlfriends and I felt it was hard to choose IT as an optional study. The course was perceived as difficult and tiresome. We also thought it was game-related and for boys who like to play computer games. Later I realised these perceptions were inaccurate! So, I wanted to share  my view on how technology can be brought closer to girls through my own experience.', 'Before my day as the CEO of Futurice, I was very nervous. I was afraid I was expected to know a lot about technology and Futurice‚Äôs business. I prepared by studying the company. I was impressed by the efforts Futurice puts into improving and managing diversity, including attracting women into the field. As part of the experience, I hoped to learn more about the challenges and opportunities girls face in the IT industry, and also get to know the diverse employees of Futurice - especially what roles female employees hold.', 'I am an inexperienced teenager with little knowledge of technology.

I could feel  the values of equality and open-mindedness during the day.', '', 'I felt so lucky to be given this chance to be part of the GTD project. I experienced many things which I would not have thought possible at this age! It was an amazing journey for me. I learned about the IT industry, the challenges and opportunities for women in this field. I also got to practise my English and pushed myself out of my comfort zone speaking in front of a large group of experts from different backgrounds!', 'I think girls and technology should no longer be an exception. I hope Futurice will continue to support this initiative and help girls excel in this industry. Maybe Futurice can work with schools that focus on science studies to develop programmes that can change girls‚Äô perceptions about IT and to encourage them to explore technology as an interest and profession. This might also include having successful female employees to share their success stories as role models to inspire exploration.', 'As for myself, after this experience with GTD, I hope in the future I can also be a role model in my chosen professional field. I want to show that girls can succeed in industries traditionally dominated  by men. I also wish to develop deeper knowledge about technology that can help the forest industry make a positive impact on the climate and improve its competitiveness globally.']",[]

All of us had to face challenges and deal with the small and big changes around us. With lockdowns all across the globe, projects and installations being put on hold, or tenders being postponed, the energy sector was no exception. However, the global pandemic also boosted creativity, digitization, and the creation of new services. So, what can we expect to see in energy next year?', 'We shared this question with domain experts Pirja Heiskanen, Lauri Anttila, Emile Stoverinck, and Jan Hermann, and compiled a list of their top trends for energy in 2021. Here‚Äôs what they would bet on.', 'As the market situation becomes more and more volatile, customer-centricity will be key to retaining and building loyal customer bases and eventually ensuring healthy business. ', 'Not long ago, most people did not really care about their energy provider. They would sign a contract once and be happy to never think about it again. However, these customers are becoming increasingly rare. People have become accustomed to high-quality digital services in most other areas of life, and their expectations towards transparency and flexibility are now much higher. As a result, clients become more likely to change energy providers.', 'The needs of end-users are also evolving. For example, an increase in electric vehicles - and the possibility to use their batteries as energy storage - or private solar panels and heat pumps create a need for more holistic solutions. It‚Äôs time for energy companies to walk their talk and put customer-centricity at the heart of every decision. Customer feedback and insights will increase the acceptance of new tools and validate underlying assumptions. Moreover, customer-centricity will enable power companies to bridge the delivery gap, help retain, grow, and refine their customer base, and ultimately, stay relevant in an evolving market.', 'More efficient grid works and smarter grids are a key element in the energy sector‚Äôs transformation. ', 'Over the coming decade, Germany plans to invest around 50 billion euros in infrastructure to ensure more efficient grid work and smarter grids. However, improving the infrastructure alone will not do the trick. Technologies like IoT and asset-tracking devices, inspection drones, or satellites produce a lot of data. Sharing that data with all relevant stakeholders and empowering them to find the correct answers to the right questions will be key to making grid operation more resilient, flexible, and sustainable.', 'Furthermore, applying analytics to the huge volume of data generated across the energy and utilities sector can provide unique insights related to customer usage patterns. This knowledge enables demand forecasting and effective energy management, but it can also help prevent fraud, reduce loss, improve compliance with regulatory requests, and improve customer services. Using data in the right way will increase user satisfaction and ultimately help companies turn data into money.', 'The interaction between producers, consumers, and grid providers is becoming more collaborative.', 'In their latest report, the German Solar Industry Association (BSW) mentioned that more than 100,000 new prosumers entered the market between February 2019 and January 2020. These people are both producers and consumers of energy, e.g. homeowners and industrial plants with photovoltaic panels on their roofs, which makes them more autonomous. Every prosumer is a potential energy manager who needs to collaborate with incumbent producers and grid providers, and their impact grows with their numbers. But with a rising number of ‚Äúmicro entities‚Äù, how can energy companies take them into consideration when production and demand are still so volatile? That‚Äôs where smart meters come into the picture.', 'Smart meters help to close the gap between consumers, producers, and grid providers. Consumers get an overview of their consumption profile and can detect saving potentials through changing routines or gearing up the infrastructure with e.g. storage facilities. For producers and grid providers, smart meters offer valuable user insights and set the basis for establishing demand response on scale. The backbone of this transformation is a grid that thinks one or two steps ahead and gives the market data-based recommendations on when to store, sell, transform, or consume energy.', 'An increasing amount of intermittent energy production causes shorter lead times and increases the need for nearly real-time management of both production and demand. Analytical solutions provide the real-time analysis needed to optimize operational performance and decision-making.', 'As a consequence of shorter lead times in the market, the focus in energy management is moving from long-term planning to enabling near real-time reaction to changes. This calls for largely automated and data and AI-augmented bidding and dispatching processes for both energy companies and companies that work in energy-intensive sectors.', 'The growing adoption of cloud platforms across the energy and utility sector is expected to have a positive impact on market growth. However, the market is facing major challenges in data security as well as privacy concerns. In addition, many energy companies lack skilled analytical expertise while struggling with the integration of new solutions into legacy IT architecture. To balance these limiting factors and to profit from the expected market growth, energy companies need to invest and increase their IT competences.', 'Hardware and digital technologies will start to co-evolve, both needing the other to deliver the necessary changes in efficiency and sustainability.', 'Traditionally speaking, energy has been a hardware heavy industry with a strong focus on physical processes. Improvements in hardware and how it‚Äôs operated will be as critical in the future as they were in the past, but they won‚Äôt be enough to make a difference. Energy companies aiming to become more efficient and sustainable will have to put as much focus on digital as they have on hardware. Software and data analytics will be needed to support future improvements in generating, distributing, and consuming electrical energy.', 'To keep up with continuous changes and evolving demands, energy companies will have to focus on their digital competencies. They will have to invest, build knowledge, and join the competition for skilled IT experts. The good news is they do not have to do everything on their own. Experienced partners like Futurice can help companies in the energy sector build a more resilient business and thrive in a rapidly changing environment.', 'Dive deeper into this topic with our energy page, and make sure to check out our latest whitepaper to learn how energy companies can use customer-centricity, data, and ecosystems to future-proof their business.']",[]

We will describe how the business value can be delivered incrementally without a need for a big upfront investment. ', 'Use cases for data and analytics in business operations vary based on the business domain. There may be a need for end-to-end planning of power production, real time management of port operations or end-to-end management of the supply chain, all the way from demand sensing to fast and efficient procurement and logistics. The resulting business benefits typically come from improved asset efficiency and shorter response time in real-time operations.', ""The primary challenge of harnessing data for operational use comes from the sheer amount of interlinked systems and data sources. It is not uncommon for a large enterprise to have two or even more Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) tools in use simultaneously ‚Äì and that's just the tip of the iceberg. This complexity, and the traditional approaches to Enterprise data, can make the idea of end-to-end visibility on business operations feel daunting.\nThis leads to a need for an alternative solution: Creating lean end-to-end solutions for the identified business needs, one at a time. The key idea is to add only those cloud based tools that are required by the solution, and make data usable through well designed and visualized user interfaces. The approach lets us build modern data flows on top of existing cloud and heritage systems ‚Äì without resorting to complex integration and implementation projects. With this approach the data platform will develop incrementally along with business needs. We have started to call this approach lovingly as creating a Thinnest Viable Platform."", '\nPicture: Following ‚Äúthe thinnest viable platform‚Äù philosophy, we do not need to add any additional tools or systems, than the ones required by the business need in question.  ', 'With the proposed approach, the business value of data and analytics can be delivered continuously without a need for a big upfront investment into data platforms. This also enables us to benefit from cloud solutions without a need to migrate possible on-premise ERPs to the cloud.', 'The following two real-world case examples demonstrate how business operations have been improved through smarter data utilisation.', 'A good example of smart real-time operations enabled by data and analytics is the Finnish railway company VR Group‚Äôs approach to commuter train disruption management. By utilizing data from existing systems, VR has built its own situational awareness system, Ohjus, to support operation center personnel in their fast-paced decision making. Visualizations, alerts and prioritized task lists enable operation personnel to focus on the issues that require their attention. At the same time, personalized views for e.g. train drivers will eventually enable decentralized actions based on the same situational awareness. There is also a plan to explore the possibility of using predefined decision rules in repetitive situations, allowing for faster response times and enabling the use of accumulated experience as a competitive advantage. VR estimates that they can reduce 60% of train cancellations due to a missing driver when the Ohjus system is in full use.', 'Finnish energy company Fortum has made its hydropower production planning smarter with Apollo, a dedicated data and advanced analytics system. Through the Apollo user interface, hydropower planning experts can simultaneously manage Fortum‚Äôs hundreds of hydropower generator assets, run various optimizations automatically using state-of-the-art optimization methods, as well as analyze the results flexibly with varying degrees of granularity.

Here he shares nine valuable insights he has learned at Futurice and as an expat from Finland in Munich.', 'It all comes down to providing value by delivering useful products and services ‚Äì without a good team, there is no good delivery. What makes a good team? The ability to communicate, to discuss and to solve problems together. And the team also needs to do a bit of advertisement for their solutions and not only do the magic but also tell the world (or at least the client) about it.', 'When building a solution collaboratively, we deliver much better results ‚Äì no matter the size of the team. We are having more fun, we validate each others‚Äô thoughts and give valuable feedback. From my perspective, the biggest hassle of teams is that people often work on different projects at the same time and only have limited time and attention to give. The challenge is to bring the right people together and have them play the same game. What helps is to book people early and explain the importance of the task.', '', 'As a pragmatist, I am trying to solve the problem at the moment it occurs and I am quick to throw a lot of ideas into the room which needs validation from the rest of the team ‚Äì so collaboration is key here, too. Clients seem to appreciate my very pragmatic and solution-prone approach to problems. I am not trying to make a huge fuss about it, I am simply trying to find solutions.', 'We are all different operating systems which we need to figure out and configure. It is not a one size fits all kind of thing, you need to actively look out for other peoples‚Äô systems and learn from them. A big part is organizing your attention, more specifically your time plus energy and focus. That means you need to plan your days according to your energy levels and tasks that either bring or drain your energy. I personally feel like good planning is the most important thing in order to be successful in my job.', ""Experiencing different cultures gives you different lenses to look at the world. I‚Äôve always liked to travel, widen my horizon, get different perspectives on the world and therefore gain ‚Äòexperience‚Äô which is highly valued in the professional world. But what does experience actually mean? It doesn't necessarily mean having twenty years of work experience in one job. Experience rather means acquiring the ability to apply learnings at the right moment. The more different situations you have found yourself in, the more learnings you can choose from and apply to new settings. This is what experience means to me and what my expat experience has primarily taught me."", 'At all our German sites you can feel that it is a Finnish company. However, it is still not Futurice Finland and frankly, it shouldn‚Äôt be either. It is a good thing that each site is a different place with a similar feeling. As all offices are operating in a different environment, economic and client structure, the same ways of working do not play out everywhere the same way. What‚Äôs important is that all offices reflect our community and culture and our values are carried out across all different sites. I think it can be experienced quite quickly that we have a culture of trust ‚Äì no matter which country location.', 'The location-specific characteristics have such a huge impact on company cultures and operation modes, so it would be too easy to believe that you can simply adapt all good practices from Finland. It takes some validation to see whether good practices from one country also work in another one. There are two levels of adaptation: first, you need to understand the learnings from one culture on a deeper level and then apply them appropriately to another culture. Second, we usually already expect differences before we first-hand experience a new culture, but it takes some effort to actually feel and handle those differences in real life.', 'I sometimes miss that Finns do not take work as seriously as Germans. I think work should be fun and some joking makes day to day work life lighter. The Finnish working attitude fits the world‚Äôs move towards a more agile and collaborative style. In a more relaxed environment, where there is no perfect plan, the results come more natural and expectations can be managed in a better way. At the same time, there are things I highly value the German working culture. I like that Germans not only take work but also their free time very seriously. I think Germans actively use their free time and after work nights for nice activities. They find their balance which reflects positively in their work performance.', 'I learned that it is important to actively recharge your batteries. What helps me to fill my energy reserves is mostly spending time with my family. I am lucky to see the way my little son faces challenges and tries to solve them which is enormously uplifting. Also, spend time in nature, travel and plan further trips.', ""Interested in reading more stories about us and our people? At Futurice, we celebrate diversity and cherish everyone's unique journey.

It says that she\'ll be experiencing a seizure in 15 seconds and should find a safe spot soon. Alice groans, ""Not again!"", and quickly climbs down the stairs, lying down on the floor before the seizure begins.', 'What if there was no alert, and she experienced the seizure while climbing the stairs?', ""Reality is, there wasn't an alert. Not for her. And not for 50 million other people. These people live with the fear of experiencing a seizure anytime and anywhere. Living with this uncertainty is their new normal. It shouldn't be."", 'If we can do something to help her quality of life with a little bit of seizure control, we will take it. We were willing to try anything. \n-- Stacy, a mother, talking about her daughter Emily (The Epilepsy Foundation)', 'Today, we mostly measure health parameters and vital signs at the so-called point-of-care. This can be a physician‚Äôs office, the clinic, the hospital or a clinical laboratory. You have to go there, wait patiently in front of the doctor‚Äôs office and eventually someone will examine your symptoms. With technological advancements taking place in portable diagnostics, algorithms and sensors, the act of measuring health parameters and vital signs becomes more convenient, mobile and cheaper.', 'We already have different wearables and sensors available to the public for various wellbeing and health applications. They can e.g. measure your blood pressure or heart rate, whether your food contains gluten, or the electrical activity in your brain or muscles. What if these new sources of data can shift our relationship with healthcare from reactive to proactive?', 'Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record the electrical activity of the brain. Electromyography (EMG) is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. EEG and EMG can be used to measure the musculoskeletal and brain activity against various treatment interventions like the medicine intake. This creates an interesting opportunity for collecting real world data for understanding the disease stage, progression, treatment efficacy, and also for clinical trials.', 'Aalto University collaborated with Futurice and Orion Pharma to explore how EEG and EMG signals from commercially available devices could be analysed to identify patterns. Aalto University selected a group of students to work on the project, Futurice provided mentoring in Software Design, Project Management, and Data Science while Orion Pharma provided the domain expertise in creating digital medical grade testing solutions and algorithms.', 'Ambitious start gets a reality check', 'Initially, the plan was to use EEG and EMG signals to understand the progression of a disease, specifically Epilepsy. This could help in understanding how the disease was reacting to the medication. Accordingly, our hardware combination was Emotiv Insight to track EEG Signals, and OpenBCI Hardware to track EMG Signals. This choice gave us the maximum input channels (5 + 4) with decent quality while being budget-friendly.', ""After a couple weeks of research, it was understood that our initial hypothesis, using EEG and EMG signals to track disease progression, was not feasible . This was because Epilepsy is a long-term disease that spans decades.Thus the amount of data needed to effectively track it's progression is huge, and there was no public dataset of that size available to us. Additionally, although there were relevant separate EEG or EMG datasets available, none of them tracked both EEG + EMG at the same time. And without the data,  it was not possible to create a data analysis model that incorporated both of them.\nA closer look into the existing research revealed that there was a lot of effort to predict epileptic seizures and that this was an extremely important research area.There were machine learning models that were achieving accuracies of > 95% while detecting and predicting epileptic seizures using EEG Signals. It was concluded that replicating a detection model during the 2-month project timeline would serve as a strong platform to build more robust prediction models in the future. Those models could build on and solve problems experienced by the models taken as references to this study."", 'Building the Model', 'Our models were trained on the Bonn University Dataset which is the most widely used public dataset for Epilepsy detection and prediction. It consists of 5 sets (A, B, C, D, E) of EEG Signals, each set containing 100 channels with 4097 data points equivalent to 23.6 seconds of data.\nSet A: Healthy Volunteers while relaxed, awake, and with their eyes open.\nSet B: Healthy Volunteers while relaxed, awake, and with their eyes closed.\nSet C: Epileptic Seizure-free Intervals (Location: Hippocampal Formation)\nSet D: Epileptic Seizure-free Intervals (Location: Epileptogenic Zone)\nSet E: Epileptic Seizure Activity\nK-Means Clustering to detect Epileptic Seizure Activity and Pyramidal 1-D Convolutional Neural Network to detect Epilepsy were built based on the available datasets.The K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised model that partitions n samples to k clusters. Each data point is partitioned to the cluster with the closest centroid, calculated using soft-Dynamic Time Warping. It returned a 94% accuracy - 377/400 time series were classified correctly with 0 type 1 errors and 23/400 time series were misclassified as type 2 error.', ""P-1D-CNN is a deep learning model that can efficiently handle limited data and achieve higher precision. It's divided into 3 steps. Firstly, the EEG signals are fragmented with fixed-size overlapping windows, and then each fragment is classified with the corresponding P-1D-CNN model. The final result is obtained by a majority voting of all the models. The model then was simplified by only implementing one P-1D-CNN to classify the signals."", '', 'Each P-1D-CNN model consists of 3 convolutional blocks to extract features, two fully connected layers with a dropout that acts as a filter to eliminate unimportant features, and finally a classification layer. Each convolutional layer, in turn, consists of 3 layers which are Convolution1D, Batch Normalization, and Rectified Linear Unit. The softmax layer was replaced for classification with a sigmoid function because it was deemed easier for the use case. To make sure that there is enough data to fit the model, the team implemented data augmentation to generate artificial data.', '', ""The model achieved an accuracy of 95.83% from the validation set. Performing cross validation with 10 folds resulted in an average accuracy of 82.86%.\nTesting our models on a healthy teammate's EEG Data, it was observed that while the K-Means Clustering model provides the correct result, the P-1D-CNN model does not. This is because currently, our classification function for the P-1D-CNN model naively sets the classification boundary as 50%. This can be refined using an ROC Curve to better reflect the data's threshold for classification.\n"", 'Regulated vs Unregulated Data in Healthcare Research', 'The prototype makes a strong case for portable diagnostics. Lowering cost and risks associated with treatments and clinical trials is in everyone‚Äôs best interest. Especially in the long-term interests of the stakeholders.\nThat said, this prototype has a long way to go just like its predecessors. It faces the same challenge that blocks the path to further improvements - lack of sufficient data for training. There is a clear need to create a larger dataset that represents a variety of people and conditions. Data that is collected at point-of-care, i.e. regulated data, can be augmented with unregulated data from mobile devices with health apps, direct-to-consumer genetic testing, crowd-sourced information, and other portable diagnostic tools. This combination can act as the first step to close the gap and harness the potential of digital health to facilitate an era of more accessible, coordinated, and personalized care. However, the path is not straightforward. Measuring health signals in a non-controlled environment requires a rigorous process for screening the incoming data. In addition, the need for designing and developing process that simplifies and incentivizes labeling and sharing of data, makes the problem a service design and cybersecurity challenge as well as data science one.', 'This blog post is written by Aayush Kucheria representing the student team that have developed and tested the prototype over the summer.']",[]

In conversation with us, he shares his first-hand experience of the industry and gives his view on the startup trends and technologies of the future of healthcare. ', 'With adjutem you support the medical device industry with a complete framework for regulatory services, device documentation, tech filing and tools for verification and validation. What would you consider as the biggest challenges for MedTech companies in the currently changing healthcare landscape?', 'There is no doubt that new regulatory frameworks such as the MDR (Medical Device Regulation) and the IVDR (In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation) are the biggest challenges for medtech companies at the moment. This has already been discussed for some years but there is still a big uncertainty in many organisations regarding the way of handling this. You can see it as a typical change process, in many cases companies try to change all affected business processes and quality policies to make it perfect. However, as a result it becomes even more complicated. \nConsequently and as a second step, an improvement of efficacy is needed to manage daily work in the long run. We think it should be seen more as a question of keeping the balance from the beginning. This is where we typically come in and support by implementing effective methods with a hands-on spirit without ignoring the real regulatory needs.', 'Networking and combining expertises and different backgrounds will be the key for innovative small companies to realize smart product ideas in the digital world. Technology is the carrier for new ideas and business models, but you need to understand user needs and the use cases behind the product to create real value for patients and users.', 'How can digitisation contribute to improving efficiency and reducing costs, also when it comes to regulatory services or device documentation?', 'This is probably a real opportunity for digitisation. The amount of documentation has increased during the last few years in this industry, also with respect to approaching different markets such as the US or China. \nAll those markets have different regulatory systems and all of them expect consistent product documentation in slightly different ways. Digital solutions can help medical device companies establish efficient project documentation and maintain the product files throughout the complete life-cycle.\nAnother aspect of digitisation is the initial product prototyping with digital mockups to collect user feedback in early project phases. We see this in many projects where user interfaces are tested without real hardware models.', 'Thinking about transforming the MedTech Industry from your 20+ years of experience  - which opportunities do you currently see?', 'There is a big chance for small organisations to step into the medtech industry as long as they are familiar with new technologies, such as data analysis, 3D-printing or app development for mobile devices. This is where traditional players have deficits and maybe they might be too slow in adapting these technologies. So we see a clear trend towards small and innovative startups developing new products with high potential - having problems to cope with the regulatory hurdles at the same time.', 'Looking at these opportunities, what is the expertise that is needed to start this transformational journey?', 'What is needed from startup companies to begin the transformational journey is a good understanding of the necessary background to fulfil all these must-haves for getting a formal product approval to make a medical device. It is not very complicated but it is what it is -  the market is regulated to ensure that only safe products can be sold. The key expertise, besides the technological skills, is the ability to fulfill the regulatory needs and to already consider these in the early stages of a project.', 'What technologies do you see as the most important drivers for these processes in the MedTech industry?', 'With respect to what I said before about the regulatory framework, I think one driver is the transfer from paperwork to digital documentation to be faster and more efficient. We recently started a pilot project where the fulfilment of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is continuously monitored with a new kind of tracking software in parallel to the product development. The purpose of this is an ongoing compilation of the complete submission file in parallel to the product design.', 'During the current crisis, we also saw that there is a huge need for change in internal processes. How do you think health players need to optimise these to stay resilient in the future?', 'The involvement of users and clients will play an important role in the future development of health related products. The transfer of medical and user needs into product design should be the most relevant aspect of development processes. In addition to that, and in spite of new challenges such as the Medical Device Regulation (MDR), time to market must be considered more than ever. Traditional product development models must be optimized in regard to this. During the last few years, agile methods have been promoted intensively but we think that this is only one possibility beside others.', 'We see that nowadays there are more and more digital health startups entering this field. What are, from your point of view, the biggest hurdles?', 'The main challenges for small companies and startups are, as already described, increasing efforts and regulatory requirements that are needed to transfer innovative ideas into real medical devices. \nWe can also see this when supporting well established companies, but especially small organisations are dependent on lean and efficient processes to move fast to the market. Another aspect we experienced in the past, is the fact that product ideas do not always fit clinical needs or medical procedures. Early involvement of users is essential for a successful market entry.', 'If you look at a more digital future in the health sector, how would you evaluate the importance of networks of partners in the field of health?', 'This also becomes more and more important. Networking and combining expertises and different backgrounds will be key for innovative small companies to realize smart product ideas in the digital world. Technology is the carrier for new ideas and business models, but you need to understand user needs and the use cases behind the product to create real value for patients and users. \nIn order to do this, you need partners with knowledge in clinical applications, usability specialists, developers and reliable manufacturers in your network. This is how we typically collaborate in our projects: with a strong focus on usability, safety and reliability of products in the intended environment.', 'About Jens Waldmann', '', 'Jens has a background in mechanical engineering and biomedical science.

Also time for me to reminisce about my personal learning journey that was so heavily influenced by open source.","['The Beginning', 'Getting Involved More Consistently', 'The Normal Open Source Trajectory', 'Continuing My Learning', 'My Academic Path', 'In Retrospect']","[""It's October again, Hacktoberfest time. Also time for me to reminisce about my personal learning journey that was so heavily influenced by open source."", 'My interest in computers and coding started rather early, so when I was 14 years old, I went to the local library, got myself a book about programming (""From Zero to Hero: Java"") and started on this wonderful path that is now not only my job, but also my passion.', ""I first came in contact with open source - well other than using excellent software like VLC - was when I encountered a problem with my music library. My dad and I had built a NAS server that I put Linux on to serve our media with a Plex Media server. We also used iTunes to sync parts of the library to mine and my sister's iPod touch. But many of the songs and especially the audiobooks had the wrong metadata, so iTunes and thus the iPod did not sort them correctly! Plex however used the filenames and based on those downloaded the correct metadata from the internet. So the question was: Is it possible to have Plex write the correct metadata for the files so iTunes would also have them?"", 'After a bit of searching the internet I found Plex Media Tagger which did exactly the thing I wanted! Sadly however it used ""subler"" for writing the metadata, a software that only works on MacOS and not on our Linux NAS. With the loads of time on my hands that comes with being a high school student, I wanted to try and make it work also on Linux. The tagger is written in Python, but at that point I had already tried my hand in several other languages like C++ and JavaScript, so I was confident that I just needed to take a look at the syntax - programming languages are all the same, right? (A misconception I would realise much later).', 'With this new goal in mind, I again searched around and found a pure python library that could write the metadata, so I could replace subler and have a pure python plugin that could run on any operating system! I forked and cloned the repository (I already used git for my personal code) and got the changes done rather quickly. It worked well enough on the Linux NAS, so I shared my work in order for others to benefit from it. Knowing not much about programming and good code style, I basically just copy pasted the python library into the project and commited that. You can see the horror that is the PR here. Apparently I missed some stuff or there are differences in the metadata for different operating systems, so it never got merged (I also did not really care about it as it was working well enough for myself).', 'I however would mark the start of my journey a bit later. It was near the end of high school and I had started freelancing on a project for a client of my dad. This was the first big web project I had. Before, I only played around with a bit of PHP and jQuery, but that had more of a duct tape feel than a properly organized application that I would be able to maintain for more than a month. So I started looking around what the status quo was for frontend development. At that time Angular 2 was in alpha and I was amazed. Two way data binding! A proper way to structure your app into components and more. It also introduced me to RxJS which I found intriguing. But it had a lot of issues. My two main gripes were debuggability - you would get a stack trace that mostly consisted of Angular code and was not really helpful - and I did not understand RxJS correctly, so I was burned by some hot/cold stream issues. To fix those I found ""The introduction to Reactive Programming you\'ve been missing"", which cleared a lot of the misconceptions I had. Sadly in the end, the debugging experience ate my productivity so I searched for something to replace Angular.', 'The two pieces I wanted to keep from Angular were RxJS and Typescript. I had always coded in typed languages (Java and C++ mainly), and I really hated that JavaScript did nothing to prevent stupid errors on my side. I\'ve seen ""undefined is not a function"" too many times even in those short tries with jQuery. Again searching around for frontend frameworks, I came across React, and saw a conference talk on YouTube about the virtual DOM that React uses. I liked the idea, but found the execution lacking.', 'In the end I stumbled across Cycle.js that was created by Andr√© Staltz, the same person who wrote the reactive programming introduction that basically went all in on RxJS by centering the whole framework around it. It was also recently converted into TypeScript at that time, so that was another plus.', 'From now on I was on what I would call a typical open source trajectory. I used the Cycle.js framework to rewrite my frontend and in that process I hit some walls. I eventually figured that the error was on my side and that I was just missing some information to avoid the error. To spare others the hours of debugging I started to contribute small patches to the documentation. At the same time I also found some missing features that I voiced in GitHub issues.', 'All in all I got more involved in the community and soon I also started fixing bugs myself that I found, instead of just opening issues. I got more known by the core team. This was then the reason I was asked if I want to speak at CycleConf 2017 in Stockholm. This being my first conference I was quite excited and in the end it was a fantastic experience that I still remember fondly. Shortly after, I was invited to become part of the core team myself, getting access to the OpenCollective Funds and helping steer the framework together with Andr√© and Nick.', 'During that time I also wanted to dive deeper into functional programming. When I first came in contact with RxJS, it was the first time I learned about higher order functions like map and reduce and I really liked the concept. It allowed me to express what I wanted to do, not really caring about how exactly it was done. So after hearing the fantastic talk about Ramda, I was addicted. So I again searched around for functional languages because I thought that this way I could really learn the concepts in their purest form and it would prevent me from falling back to my old patterns - mainly OOP. This turned out to be one of the better decisions I made in my life. I started to learn Haskell, at the beginning with Learn you a Haskell for Great Good and later with Real world Haskell which is sadly a bit outdated (so do not expect to follow the code 100%), but the general ideas still hold true today.', 'This was the first time since starting to program that a new way of thinking about code and algorithms was opened to me. Through me learning Java and C++ as my first languages, I used to solely think in for-loops and if-conditions. But being forced to write purely functional code makes you think differently about problems. At least for me, it pushed me to think more about the data structures and not only about the algorithms. It showed me that there are more ways to do concurrency than slapping a synchronized keyword everywhere. That mutable state is the root of all evil and just so much more.', 'Learning Haskell also set me on a more research-focused path. I had already started my computer science studies, but after learning Haskell I became more interested in the theoretical science. I wanted to see why languages are like they are. What are the similarities? What are the pros and cons of e.g. garbage collection. And especially type systems became really intriguing to me. Haskell is just so much more expressive than for example Java where the type system can be a burden at times. While not perfect, in Haskell the type system is much more helpful, preventing you from making dumb mistakes, and with some more work on your side, even not so dumb mistakes.', 'I got more into theorem proving, i.e. using a programming language to write mathematical proofs and have them checked by a compiler. Step by step I am working on a machine checked proof of type safety of System Fc, the intermediate language of the Haskell compiler.', 'Looking back at my journey, there were a few key events that brought me to where I am now. The first one was getting this freelance project that made me look more into modern frontend frameworks. Then, through Angular, getting to know RxJS and thus getting in contact with functional programming. Going deeper into Cycle.js and being invited to speak at my first conference. And lastly starting to learn Haskell which set me on a more research oriented path.', 'I am also super grateful that the Open Source work I do is sustainable for me. This is in part thanks to our generous backers on OpenCollective, but also through Futurice, the company I work for. Futurice has the Spice Program that pays a flat hourly rate for any Open Source work any employee does in their free time. Those two sources of income would not be enough to work full time, but they allow me to have dedicated days that I can focus on Cycle.js.', ""All in all, I can say that every time I learned something fundamentally different and new, even if I would not use it in my day to day job, I've really benefited from the experience. So in case you want advice from a 23 year old, keep learning! Try out completely new stuff even if it is not immediately useful for you! My style of writing code even in imperative languages has evolved a lot over the years.""]",[]

It used to be so simple: I like drawing and cars ‚Äì why not become a car designer? I studied industrial design and specialized in exterior and transportation design until I suddenly had doubts. I realized that design is much broader and I wanted to be on the digital side of things. By becoming a designer at Futurice, I turned my long-time passion into something that also reflects my intentions as who I am today: reach people and make an impact on humanity.', 'I am a designer, but not a car designer. The transformation to the digital side of things has shifted my perspective towards a more diverse and inclusive one. At Futurice, I have the opportunity to widen my horizon as project work allows me to jump on different tasks requiring different skills. This is why I have learned incredibly much within the short amount of time since I started at Futurice.

However, I was afraid of fully committing to a job at such an early stage. Where I am from, people stick with one position for most of their lives. So I felt my first job was an important decision I didn‚Äôt want to rush into. I remembered a uni workshop where I met one of the IoT Kit creators from Futurice. Really fun guy! Later, I understood how lucky I was to set a foot into Futurice, where there was a lot more for me to come. I started a full-time position and would have never expected to be able to learn that much in such a short time.', 'I was curious to see how it feels to help build up a newborn site (in 2020). I‚Äôm at a point in my life where a well-established office is not yet important. What mattered to me, was the opportunity to try new things and make an impact. By default, I like to push myself out of my comfort zone. The new office felt like one of those opportunities on the edge of my comfort zone. I learned a lot about company culture in Munich ‚Äì simple things such as an open feedback culture. And here I am now, doing my part to build up that kind of office culture in Stuttgart and contribute to a new community.', 'The volume of the projects are different as we were newly starting with most clients. Besides, I see Futurice as the unicorn in the area due to the diversity in the team. It is harder to find that many international, diverse and talented people elsewhere in this area. \nRegarding our office culture, everyone was new, so everyone was equally committed to investing time to get to know each other, the office and the off-site area. The smaller the office, the easier to create cozy family vibes. To me, the Stuttgart office has been a great opportunity ‚Äì both in terms of business and personal growth.', '', 'I feel good where I am and I want to keep the positive spirit about where I am headed ‚Äì individually and on a team level. I am open towards the future and excited to gain more confidence and experience as a junior designer ‚Äì finding the balance between my skills, goals and real-life limitations while keeping my eyes open for learning opportunities.

Recent data leaks and inappropriate usage of user data contribute to user concerns. Energy companies need to act responsibly and be transparent in communicating how they use their customer data.,[],"['As Head of Product Design at tado¬∞, Chris Baumann knows how smart energy thermostats can efficiently reduce the energy consumption while enhancing user comfort at the same time. In this interview, he gives away his take on the impact of smart energy use on the business side, data regulations and smart grids in the energy market. ', 'With its Smart Thermostats for heating and cooling, tado¬∞ is one of the leaders in intelligent home climate management. How have smart thermostats changed the way energy is consumed and business is made? ', 'Smart thermostats ensure that heating and cooling systems only run when users really need them with just the right level of output ‚Äì all automatically. Adding this smartness to traditional heating systems can significantly reduce the amount of energy consumed to heat and cool buildings. Energy is therefore consumed more efficiently while also enhancing user comfort.', ""On the business side, the impact of smart thermostats is diverse. Since smart thermostats can read data from heating systems and transmit them to the cloud, they can support energy players in offering more relevant services. In a demand response market, large loads of energy can be turned on or off via smart thermostats in users' homes to contribute to grid stability and generate revenue."", 'Despite the benefits, many users are hesitant towards the installation of smart thermostats because of security concerns. What can energy companies do to increase their acceptance? ', 'Smart thermostats and smart home tech in general are still something very new and unknown to the majority of people. It takes time to build user trust with new technologies. Recent data leaks and inappropriate usage of user data (e.g. Cambridge Analytica‚Äôs use of Facebook user data) contribute to these concerns.', 'Energy companies, like any other player in the smart home space, need to act responsibly, use the latest security standards, and be transparent in communicating how they use their customer data and what data security measures they have in place. Many user concerns are based on a lack of knowledge rather than on facts. To address this issue, it‚Äôs our job to help educate the market and to be clear in our communications.', 'My personal experiences while interviewing tado¬∞ users is that they weigh the added value of smart home technology higher than a potential risk. However, our users are not yet a cross-section of society.', 'tado‚Äôs products offer services like geofencing, weather adaptation, or open window detection - functions that strongly depend on data. How would you describe the role of Data & AI in reshaping the energy business? ', 'Smart energy behavior in our products is based on algorithms built by the team and based on extensive user research. The algorithms are then operating automatically - based on the user data they are fed with. Precise and convenient energy businesses can enhance their offering by using data in smart ways.', 'Already today the energy business with its connected grids is very data based and some of the upcoming complex challenges like grid stability can only be solved by making smart use of data.', 'It takes time to build user trust with new technologies.

But at the same time, end user needs and expectations are changing rapidly. Understanding the possibilities of technology is one thing, and understanding the needs of end users is another. To bridge the gap between these two, we have to embrace digital services.\n', 'Until very recently, the end user experience of professional-grade devices and equipment would stay the same throughout the life cycle of the equipment. It would be assembled, delivered and set up, and then serviced as needed ‚Äì that‚Äôs it. For decades, this used to be the status quo in nearly every industry. But over the past ten years or so, this reality has been changing.', 'In tomorrow‚Äôs hardware market, survival is no longer just a question of making world-class products. Instead, it‚Äôs increasingly about what happens after the products reach the end users, and the key to success here are digital services that are designed to seamlessly support and extend the capabilities ‚Äì and user experience ‚Äì of physical devices.', 'These value-adding services reward manufacturers with new opportunities to grow sales and tap into new revenue streams. They will also play a key role in helping keep customers and users happy, and ultimately, justify premium pricing.', 'There are many factors contributing to this shift, all of which are strongly linked to the need to stay relevant in the market.', 'As the business landscape evolves, hardware manufacturers have an ever-growing need to stand out and differentiate from their competitors. End user expectations have ballooned, due largely to the high standard of user experience (UX) that people have grown used to with their personal consumer devices. And let‚Äôs face it ‚Äì a world without digital services no longer exists. At this point, we are so used to them in our everyday lives that not having them around simply feels... off.', 'The healthcare industry has followed roughly the same pattern. Personal wearables and other consumer-grade smart devices have paved the way and helped establish a new appreciation of exceptional service design and UX. Professional-grade medtech is now starting to follow suit as the demand for usability spreads.', 'But the most pressing demand for value-adding digital services comes from the needs of the healthcare industry, where legal and regulatory changes constrain entrepreneurial activity and increase pressure on hospitals. In 2017, for example, roughly 30% of hospitals in Germany reported annual losses due to e.g. high regional hospital density, as well as small department sizes and limited specialization in individual hospitals.', 'These economic and regulatory realities are forcing healthcare providers to respond by consolidating further. In the coming years, this will mean a decreasing number of both hospitals and beds through closures and mergers. Salaries account for the majority of business costs in the industry, and there is already a shortage of talent among nurses as well as doctors. And at the same time the population keeps growing older, and the number of people in need of care keeps rising throughout Europe. Competition will become increasingly fierce, and as a result, services have to be rendered as cost-effective as possible.', 'In a situation like this, the most important purpose that medical equipment manufacturers ‚Äì from diagnostic devices to treatment equipment, and from medical monitors to life support machines ‚Äì can serve on the end user level is to aid healthcare professionals and enable them to improve their workflow. This has to happen on the professionals‚Äô terms. Paying attention to who the end users of the products really are, and involving them in the design process from the very beginning is crucial to ensuring the services focus on solving problems that really matter. The focus has to be on adding genuine value rather than trying to force-feed a technology or solution.', 'In many cases, digital services can reach beyond the various healthcare professionals and also empower patients, helping them understand and stay on top of their treatment and recovery process. This is another important user group to consider, and something that forward-thinking healthcare providers that are concerned about their customer journey weigh carefully.', 'Continuous support and UX-enhancing improvements throughout the lifecycle of the equipment are an important way to keep users engaged and build trust over time. And perhaps even more significantly, they represent crucial future-proofing features that are bound to become a key element when comparing hardware offerings between manufacturers during the procurement process.', 'Luckily, medtech has an undeniable benefit on its side: a treasure trove of valuable insight from other fields. By now, there‚Äôs a lot that can be learned from industries that have already gone through similar changes.', 'Even in a very old-school and conservative industry like banking, which has been considered very difficult to break into, fintech startups have managed to set off a wave of disruption. Perhaps most famously, N26 has successfully seized a major opportunity with its mobile-first bank account, based largely on the observation that user behavior was changing while the industry was too stuck in its ways to pay proper attention to UX.', 'In the automotive industry, we can observe a different pattern where incumbent players‚Äô efforts have paid off. BMW and Daimler, for example, have combined several value-adding services under the YOUR NOW joint venture that offers new experiences centered around their offering. Another example would be a collaboration between BMW and the Viessmann group that aims to create new customer value at the intersection of e-mobility and energy.', 'Futurice has also co-created various digital services that would translate well into the healthcare context. One such example with a strong hardware focus is Bosch PRO360, an extendable microservice platform and suite of mobile and web apps we‚Äôve built together with Bosch Power Tools. It enables end users e.g. to register their tools to extend their warranty in exchange for generating valuable end user and dealer insights that support data-driven sales.', 'To stay competitive in the future, medtech companies should start exploring the various opportunities of value-adding digital services ‚Äì preferably sooner rather than later. There‚Äôs no need to start from scratch either, because a pretty good consensus already exists on the most promising areas for digital services in medtech:', 'Implants or devices that are the core or primary component of patient therapy. In this use case, medtech companies can offer services embedded in products like blood sugar trackers and pacemakers to generate more data and insights, and help find potential solutions for the patient.', 'Devices that can track and monitor patients in therapy that takes place across different facilities, in the interest of making the patient journey much more seamless.', 'Partnerships with care providers with a focus on value-based care. This can be a particularly lucrative approach with devices that have a very large role in treatments or procedures and take a substantial amount of budget.', 'Data aggregation and visualization from multiple devices across different hospitals to provide live status updates of critical patients or resources. For example, during the Covid pandemic, this could mean displays in ICU units that track the number of patients on ventilators, and available ventilators or beds in the unit, to enable faster and more efficient decision-making for healthcare professionals.', 'Digitalizing the operating room with software and infrastructure can help surgeons drive personalized procedures based on disease, past treatment outcomes and best practice guidelines.', 'Personalization beyond the patient. Digital operating rooms can be customized to the needs and preferences of a specific surgeon, enabling them to create and execute the best possible surgical plan for their patient.', 'One practical example that we at Futurice have been closely involved with is the My Health mobile service we‚Äôve co-created with Terveystalo, a private sector healthcare provider based in Finland. The mobile service has succeeded in improving both the customer and employee experience, as well as creating daily value and giving a competitive advantage.', 'Through the service, Terveystalo customers have immediate access to help anytime and anywhere via online chat or remote meetings with doctors and nurses. This makes services equally available throughout sparsely populated Finland, lowers the threshold for seeking help, and makes preventive healthcare by offering customers a better degree of transparency into their medical information. Terveystalo, on the other hand, benefits from the possibility to take care of more patients regardless of location, make peak hours easier to deal with, and reduce manual work.', 'Digital services are rapidly becoming an integral part of customer experience, and this development marks an important turning point for medtech companies and hardware manufacturers as well. They represent a way to future-proof hardware offerings, but also strengthen the brand, build stronger customer relationships and unlock new sales opportunities.', 'In the interest of staying relevant and resilient in a volatile market, they will have to start investing time and money into digital service design, and build the necessary skill sets to cater to emerging end user needs, or risk becoming obsolete.', 'The best practices that have worked in other industries can, for the most part, offer actionable insights for the healthcare industry as well.

On this journey, strategy, change management, and culture are as important as tech, tools, and data science expertise. In order to get started on your journey towards becoming data-enabled, you need to understand what the defining characteristics of such an organisation are. ', '', 'The one thing that bears repeating: Data should underpin your strategy and help you solve your key business problems.', 'Implementing a data strategy requires transparency. Your data strategy must align with the desired business outcomes or goals expressed by the owners, board, or executive committee.', 'So leadership buy-in is crucial for a successful data-enabled business transformation. By tying the data strategy to the business strategy, communicating its value for your organisation becomes a lot easier. Some organisations manifest their commitment to becoming data-enabled by appointing or hiring a CDO (Chief Data Officer), others place the responsibility in the hand of the CIO (Chief Innovation Officer). Whatever approach is right for you, a successful data strategy requires ownership on the C-level, with endorsement and support from the CEO, executive team, or board. A verbal endorsement must be accompanied by adequate funding for data-related initiatives.', 'Ideally, your data strategy should combine two horizons:', '1. Short term: Showing early wins for business value and its impact to demonstrate the first possibilities and educate the rest of the organisation. These are often related to optimizations or increased efficiency.', '2. Long term: Focus on the desired end state that is usually only achievable over a longer period of time due to higher complexity and strategic value. Examples are new, innovative functionalities or business models that expand the company ambition level.', 'Governance and risk management are two additional considerations. When it comes to governance, your ambition should be to create a common framework across your organization suitable to meet business, legal and regulatory needs. Clearly define and review potential risks related to data and its usage. This will form the basis of a risk mitigation plan.', 'The outcome is a combined roadmap including your data strategy, aligned with your governance framework and risk mitigation activities. The strategic roadmap is the foundation of your transformation.', 'At the heart of any organisation is its culture: Shared behaviours, beliefs, values and assumptions that influence how people behave and act in their jobs. Data culture governs how employees view and act upon data. Like any cultural change, embedding a data culture takes time, commitment and perseverance. Solving technical data problems is hard, changing culture and behaviour is even harder. It‚Äôs definitely worth the effort, though.', '‚ÄúPutting data in the hands of a few experts is a powerful thing, but making it available throughout the organisation can be a game-changer.‚Äù (Doug Bordanora, Info World, March 2018)', ""If data as a resource is seen as relevant to only specific parts of an organisation, instead of integrated in a holistic and strategic manner across the entire organization, your transformation ambitions will be undermined. People who are refused access to data can't help but question the insights, information, and decisions that are derived from it."", ""One can investigate employees' data mindset and data-savviness by asking a simple question: ‚ÄúHow do you use data to make decisions?‚Äù A data mindset is not only relevant for data scientists or engineers, but also for designers, strategists and especially for internal functions such as HR."", 'In a multi-disciplinary approach, designers, for example, use a data-informed design process that combines a qualitative human-centred approach with rational insights gathered qualitatively. This path not only guides strategic decisions but also informs tactical decisions and helps discover opportunities for incremental improvements or innovation along the way.', 'In the end, the right mindset is manifested in the way people work. Start making data available to everyone in the organization and provide the tools to analyse it. Airbnb has built a user-friendly Dataportal that helps every employee navigate the data landscape and find relevant resources. Combine this self-service data culture with collaborative and multidisciplinary problem solving and new ideas emerge.', 'A healthy data culture fosters data-enabled decision-making across all levels and disciplines. A healthy data culture is one where people ask, ""Where is the data to back that up?"".', 'Technology may not be the biggest barrier to transformation, - possibly because it gets the attention and budgets it deserves - but there are a few important things to consider. We will highlight a few aspects of data and operational technology that have a major impact on how data-enabled an organisation really becomes.', 'Data Governance is teamwork. It requires a combination of ethics, company values, data quality and security.

Thus it is important for us to apply those principles to our data governance. One example is that we have developed the Our Data initiative, a platform where any futuricean can see what data there is of them in the data lake, giving them options to opt out of certain services. You can watch a webinar recording about the initiative from here. We are also putting together a data governance community of employees who oversee data governance to get a broad perspective on how we can live our values.', ""Data tools are key to becoming data-enabled as they allow employees not only access to data but add a layer of usability on top which should aim to make data exploration easier. It is thus important that data tools are built with the user's needs not only in mind but are an integral part of the development or decision-making process. Creating such tools and applications does not only require top tech talent but also experienced designers advocating and implementing user needs into a seamless experience. \nSetting up a proper data infrastructure, data lakes, cleaning data etc. takes time. Therefore, it is important to prioritise solving key business problems and build from there rather than trying to solve everything at once."", 'The data and AI paradigm shift will force us to rethink organizational structures, processes and workflows, metrics, governance and decision-making, and, of course, culture.

Since then, I've faced many new professional challenges working side-by-side with Deniz Eroglu, an experienced iOS-developer. This being my first professional mobile app and React Native project, I wanted to share my learnings so far. I hope it will be a valuable read for any existing or prospective React Native developers."", 'Before starting new projects at Futurice, we are encouraged to set up one or more Expert Exchange sessions. We primarily reach out internally for colleagues with relevant professional experiences (in this case developing mobile apps) and ask them to share tips and possible challenges.', ""Before deciding how to build the app in 2019 we had a great chat with a developer from our Helsinki office; Axel Havukangas. He gave us invaluable input on the future plans on some of the key community libraries like React Navigation and React Native Firebase. This led us to use beta-versions of both libraries right from the start. The new APIs weren't 100% stable but it meant we could go all-in on React Hooks as well as avoid bigger migrations between the existing versions and those that have since been officially released."", 'React Native rewards early adopters. Your project will benefit if you buy into the evolving nature of the framework.', 'Axel also insisted we use TypeScript. Specifically to benefit from the advanced static analysis which helps us write as bug-free code as possible. For a mobile project this is even more important than for web apps. Even small bug fixes need to go through time-consuming app store reviews. Silly mistakes that are shipped to production can, therefore, become unnecessarily costly.', 'Take away: the more insights you can collect about the current and future state of React Native and the community, the better. Seek out people with experience and ask them for advice before starting new projects. Embrace change, React Native is a continuously evolving library - you will do best to evolve with it.', 'Your app will often interact with native components (image picker, in-app browser, storage, etc.) All these use cases require a JavaScript-to-native API as well as code to account for platform differences. The benefits of relying on community libraries for these abstractions rather than implementing them yourself quickly become apparent.', 'This means you will be installing a lot of 3rd party dependencies - a natural consequence of writing cross-platform and non-native code. Luckily bundle size is less of a concern for mobile apps compared to web apps. However, every added dependency still comes at a cost to added uncertainty.', 'Take away: be comfortable with a growing list of dependencies, make React Native Community your first stop for high quality packages, and no matter what; update your dependencies early and often to avoid painful migrations.', ""Coming into the project, I only had brief experience building mobile apps with Cordova. Therefore I was intrigued to see that React Native took a very different approach to how it handles inherently platform-specific concepts like build configurations, code signing, and app icons. Instead of baking it into the framework, React Native always defers to how it's normally handled by the platforms. You even check-in the whole Xcode-project to version control! This also means you need to be comfortable digging around in Xcode and getting around Android Studio to be an efficient React Native developer - even if you still only code in JavaScript/TypeScript."", 'Fight the fear of booting up Android Studio! Get comfortable before you run into the trickier problems.', 'I had the pleasure of working on this project alongside an experienced iOS developer that took care of 90% of the initial setup of the iOS/Android projects. It has made me an order of magnitude more confident that we are doing things the canonical way.', ""Having said that, don't give up, fellow web developer! I know from first-hand experience how overwhelmed native developers are when getting into web development. It's fundamentally the same learning process when you first try to navigate and understand the bits and pieces of an Xcode-project. You just need to give it time and gain experience."", 'Take away: ideally, at least one person in the team should have native app development experience. React Native does let you ""write native apps in JavaScript"" - but if you\'re developing for mobile, there\'s no getting around having to interact with the platforms themselves from time to time.', 'Speaking of frustrations, upgrades between React Native versions is a known pain-point. There are ongoing efforts to streamline the process but it still remains manual and tedious. A few times I\'ve been scared to break things since I don\'t fully understand what\'s going on ""under the hood"". However, our overall experience has been pretty smooth. We knew migrating between versions could cause headaches and therefore we\'ve always stayed up-to-date with the latest releases. Doing many small migrations has helped minimize the risk of messing something up in a big way.', 'Over time we have also developed a better understanding of the setup, including which of the changes in the migration-diffs that are required and which we can safely ignore.', ""Take away: upgrading React Native can be a daunting task but don't fear it too much. What's important is to prioritize updates so you can stay ahead of the curve and adopt new versions as they roll in."", 'The most frustrating things about developing with React Native is debugging and testing.', ""I do most of my debugging using React Native Debugger which doesn't require any setup and has served me well. However, from time to time you need to boot up Xcode or Android Studio to dig deeper into a particularly tricky issue. I would much prefer having a unified debugging experience. Instead, React Native developers are forced to master three separate debug environments to cover all their needs."", ""Even more frustrating, however, has been to setup a working test infrastructure. The first challenge is to figure out how to correctly configure TypeScript and Jest. Then add in React Native to the mix and you're in for a real treat! And don't forget that you also need to mock every library that interacts with native code. Luckily, some of them ship their own mocks while others leave you to google for hours to resolve the cryptic error messages."", 'With everything up and running, I find myself asking ""after I mock 50% of the code that runs in my app - what am I really testing?"" Even when all tests pass, I simply don\'t feel confident that things are indeed working. At this point I would normally re-focus my efforts to end-2-end tests but that\'s a whole other beast when it comes to mobile apps. It\'s especially difficult since our test APIs are only available behind a VPN which means we can\'t automate such tests using 3rd-party services.', ""Take away: prepare yourself for a debugging experience that's a little schizophrenic (React Native Debugger, Xcode, Android Studio). Bring a great deal of patience when setting up your tests for the first time. Take your time to understand it and avoid shortcuts. Invest in end-2-end tests if you have the opportunity."", 'Working with React Native has been a mixed bag. I love it and I hate it. So should you pick it for your next project?', ""Write once, deploy anywhere. React Native does enable you to deploy to both Android and iOS from a single codebase.

From his perspective, the quality and efficiency of inpatient care can be improved considerably by digitising processing and using existing data in novel ways. Find out how Cliniserve helps hospitals to improve the utilization and allocation of their care personnel.\n', 'Cliniserve is offering a SaaS solution for hospitals and helping to solve the problem of growing shortage of nursing staff. Can you tell us a little bit more about the problem you want to solve?', 'Practically all developed countries are struggling with a large shortage of qualified personnel in care occupations. According to the Bertelsmann Stiftung (2012), Germany is dealing with a shortage of around 80 000 nurses, and this is predicted to grow to up to 200 000 by 2025. At the same time, this scarce resource is not used effectively. Studies show that nurses in an acute care unit (your average hospital ward with no intensive care patients) only get to spend 15 % of their working time on the task they were qualified for - patient care. On the contrary, 20 % goes to walking around, another 20 % to documentation and 35 % to administrative work like communication and coordination. Much of this is due to outdated tools and processes that nurses work with every day, and we believe that digitization in this area can contribute greatly to countering the issue of personnel shortage. We focus on reducing the time nurses spend walking around and coordinating work within their own ward as well as between departments of the hospital.', 'When looking at hospitals, how could data help to improve their efficiency?', 'By far the largest part of hospitals‚Äô budget goes to personnel, and most of that to nursing personnel, as they represent such a large part of the total workforce. This is despite the fact that they earn a lot less than doctors. By utilizing existing data that hospitals have on patient diagnoses, disabilities, and treatment plans, we believe hospitals can automate most of the coordination of patient care and delegate tasks more effectively to the suitable personnel. This way nurses would save time on coordination and tasks that don‚Äôt require their qualification and could be taken over by service personnel. This would also reduce the risk of human error in coordination between departments, reducing the amount of waiting times in operating and examination rooms.', 'What do you think are the biggest hurdles for healthcare companies to successfully use Data & AI to improve the treatment of patients?', 'Besides the obvious challenge of data protection, our customers and us have to deal with political hurdles and challenges to do with interoperability. The hurdles caused by data protection are quite obvious and understandable, but in most cases solvable with technology and system architecture. In our experience, what has turned out to be more difficult is dealing with political resistance to change as well as the usage of data. Hospitals are large organizations with starkly contrasting interests between management, doctors and nurses. The workers councils are often critical towards the management and resistant to change when it comes to introducing new tools or using data in novel ways. Especially if there is any chance that it might influence the workforce and what is expected of them. Finally, there is the huge hurdle of interoperability. Hospitals have acquired their information systems a long time ago, and back then interoperability was not such a large consideration. Nowadays, they are frankly being held hostage by the providers of those systems, who are trying to protect their position as the gatekeeper of all the valuable data and demand outlandish fees for the implementation of new interfaces and are not open to a more open landscape of interoperability between systems.', 'By utilizing existing data that hospitals have on patient diagnoses, disabilities, and treatment plans, we believe hospitals can automate most of the coordination of patient care and delegate tasks more effectively to the suitable personnel.', 'The current crisis has shown that there is also a need for change in internal processes. In which ways do health players need to optimize internal operations in order to stay resilient?', 'Hospitals have long been struggling with keeping their shifts staffed in case of absences. In the current crisis, healthcare professionals have been especially vulnerable as they have been treating patients with the virus. Thus, hospitals increasingly need to be able to schedule their personnel flexibly and be able to staff shifts on short notice. The most progressive ones have already set up nurse pools, in which the personnel are qualified to work in different departments of the hospital and available to jump in for shifts in any of them with short notice. Additionally, they have started scheduling shifts outside the traditional morning, afternoon, night shift models to be able to reply to load peaks in a better way. This is also where our TEAM solution comes in, helping hospitals coordinate pools, finding replacements as well as rewarding employees for jumping in on short notice.', 'We can see that more and more startups are entering the field of digital healthcare. Where do you see the biggest opportunities startups can bring to the healthcare industry?', 'Healthcare is a very broad field, and there is a plethora of opportunities in different segments of the industry. From our perspective, improving the quality and efficiency of inpatient care is highly attractive. German hospitals alone spend 18 Billion Euros annually on the salary costs of nurses, meaning that even small improvements in the efficiency of their work can lead to huge financial gains. Of course, these gains are not achieved by getting rid of nurses. On the contrary, gains are required to keep the system running with less qualified nurses available. \nBut healthcare is not just about inpatient care. Digitization can also radically help prevent patients landing in inpatient care altogether, for example by enabling patient consultation and monitoring remotely and incentivizing behavior that prevents illnesses in the first place.', 'Looking at these opportunities, what else needs to be done to transform Germany into a digital health nation? ', 'As healthcare is almost completely funded publicly, the government needs to make funds available, and even more importantly, incentivize healthcare providers to pursue digitization that adds value. Healthcare providers, just like any other market actors, react to incentives and try to optimize their costs and revenues. For example, setting limits on how many nurses need to be present in each shift does not automatically lead to better patient outcomes and care quality, but measuring long-term patient outcomes and patient satisfaction will. If patients receive the care they require, it should not matter whether the ward was staffed with 1 or 100 nurses. Similarly, it makes no sense that hospitals are paid a fixed amount per case/intervention. This just leads to providers optimizing for days spent in the hospital and unnecessary procedures, while they should be paid based on the quality of the long-term outcome.', 'Which technologies do you think will play the biggest role in the transformation process?', 'It would be a good start to digitize manual processes, connect different actors and enable interoperability between systems. I am talking about such simple things as web services and open APIs that will act as the fundament that future technologies can build upon. I think it is quite descriptive of the state of digitization in the healthcare system that different healthcare providers have no way of sharing/accessing existing records about me, even if I would consent to it or if my life would depend on it in case of an accident.', 'What are potential obstacles in the user acceptance of digital health services and how to overcome them?', 'When it comes to the collection and usage of health data, users are extra careful about their privacy. I think we saw it in the case of the COVID-19 tracing apps that data frugality and full transparency about the collection and usage of data is paramount to user acceptance in the digital health space. We also follow this principle by explicitly opting out of collecting any personal data about the patients that use our app in the hospital. This has also benefited us a lot, making our solution easier to accept for data privacy officers as well as patients.', 'When looking at the future of Cliniserve - what will be the next steps you will take?', 'We are constantly developing our service further to help hospitals improve the utilization and allocation of their care personnel. We are thus working towards building the operating system for nurses, which they use for all of their coordination from shift allocation to task delegation. This way, we want to enable hospitals to manage care processes in a more flexible and outcome-oriented way than today. At the same time, we are growing our customer base beyond Germany, with initial focus on the Swiss and Austrian markets.', 'About Jaakko Nurkka', '', 'Jaakko Nurkka is a Co-Founder and Managing Director of Cliniserve.

Going forward, physical and digital will co-evolve, both needed and none able to deliver the necessary changes in efficiency and sustainability on their own.",[],"['Strategy advisor and former CEO for General Electric Germany Dr. Carlos H√§rtel is drawing on years of experience in the field of energy and is discussing the current trends of the energy sector with us. He shares his take on the role of hardware and software analytics and about how the physical and the digital will have to co-evolve in the future.\n', 'The energy business is changing - digitization is one of the key ingredients of the shift happening. How do you perceive the status quo of the interplay between the traditional hardware side and the new digital energy business?', 'New digital business models are clearly making inroads in the energy sector, but the development is not yet as fast as many had expected just a couple of years back. A key driver for data and platform technologies moving to the fore is the upcoming trend towards a more distributed energy system coupled with greater penetration of renewables. Matching supply and demand will become a lot harder and will require more machine smartness once today‚Äôs fleet of centralized power-generation plants ‚Äì be they fossil-fueled or nuclear ‚Äì are retiring. Expect the role of digital technologies and data-based services to strongly gain in importance over the coming 5-10 years.', 'Where do you see the biggest innovation opportunities for the big energy players?', 'Starting with the power-generation side of the energy industry, cost reduction will remain an important topic for the foreseeable future. This can mean e.g. predictive technologies for better maintenance and less downtime of assets, operations optimization for entire fleets, or business optimization through smarter scheduling of plant dispatch etc. On the grid side, i.e. in the regulated sector of the electricity market, solutions for ensuring or improving system stability are becoming more important. This may include better forecasting of supply and demand in a decarbonized world, and new services for demand-side management on a larger scale. Obviously, in all of the above opportunities data, analytics, and digital capabilities play an essential role.', 'So, options for a successful change are there. However, it is often difficult to start. How do you think energy companies can tackle the challenges of the future? Where should they begin?', 'When you look only a couple of years back, the idea of ‚Äòwholesale digital transformation‚Äô was on everybody‚Äôs mind. That meant redefining a business from the ground up. Not much good has come out of it for large industrial companies, other than expensive learning from failures. In my view, the more appropriate approach to digitalizing also in energy companies is to progress ‚Äòone app at a time‚Äô. How can a data-based service help a company do even better what it already does well? How can it help fix long-standing weaknesses? There are obvious and near-term opportunities in every company that should be tackled first. Quick wins will then help a digitization initiative to build the credibility and track record it needs for long-term success.', 'Which role, do you think, will hardware business play in the future of energy?', 'Let me phrase it like that, our world is and remains fundamentally material. Improvements in hardware and how it‚Äôs being operated will be as critical in the future as they were in the past. The difference is the extent to which software and data analytics will be needed to support these future improvements in generating, distributing and consuming electrical energy. The physical and the digital will co-evolve going forward, both needed and none able to deliver the necessary changes in efficiency and sustainability on their own.', 'How do you perceive the role of the customer in the changing energy sector?', 'To me, the advent of the so-called ‚Äòprosumer‚Äô, who is both a producer and consumer of electricity, is possibly one of the most disruptive developments in energy markets. It‚Äôs not a major force today, to be honest, but it will no doubt change the balance of power in the energy space moving forward. Consumers so far have remained fairly passive. Few even bother to change their electricity provider in order to save money ‚Äì even if a better offering is just a mouse click away. But I‚Äôm quite certain that attitudes will change once a large enough group of individuals or households are starting to sell energy from their roof-mounted PV panels to other users.', 'Change also requires companies to look at themselves and their processes. Where do you see the biggest needs for organizational development in the energy business?', 'Personally, I‚Äôm taking it as a given that the whole energy sector will remain in flux and will have to come to terms with fundamental uncertainty for many years to come. The ability of companies to continually adapt has become a core competency in this industry, for small and large players alike. In my consultancy work, I often find that a perceived lack of organizational flexibility is too quickly attributed to cultural factors. Sometimes the mindset of an industry is blamed, sometimes allegedly narrow-minded middle managers. I‚Äôm not disputing the role of company culture or attitudes, but much more critical are structural factors. Every organization that has gone through years of continuous improvement has inevitably traded flexibility for efficiency. I would recommend any company to analyze themselves in terms of operational interfaces between teams, functions and also external stakeholders. Many of those may turn out to be so hard-wired that the way how business can be done becomes hard-wired too. A flexible organization can‚Äôt afford that. And, yes, flexibility comes with overhead and the need for more and better leadership. But there‚Äôs just no way around that.', 'Our world remains fundamentally material. Improvements in hardware and how it‚Äôs being operated will be as critical in the future as they were in the past. The difference is the extent to which software and data analytics will be needed to support these future improvements in generating, distributing and consuming electrical energy. Going forward, physical and digital will co-evolve, both needed and none able to deliver the necessary changes in efficiency and sustainability on their own.', 'Looking into the future - energy and mobility will need to grow together even more. What are the three key areas both sides should focus on to make this collaboration work?', 'I‚Äôd put openness first. Across industries we‚Äôre grappling with inefficiencies which often have to do with an unwillingness to share information with external parties. If we want to make the sector coupling between energy and mobility work, we need to have a lot of data sharing. \nSecond, we need to figure out how profit pools and revenue streams can be made attractive to all participants. If we want everyone on board, there has to be enough in it for everyone. It‚Äôs as simple as that. \nThird, regulation will play a major role in how sector coupling will progress, or even if it will happen at all. Traditionally, the energy and the mobility sector have had their own regulatory regimes, which covered the specific risks and needs of each domain. I cannot see how energy and mobility can really evolve in tandem without the regulatory bodies getting synchronized too.', 'About Dr. Carlos H√§rtel', '', 'Dr. Carlos H√§rtel is a strategy advisor to private companies and public-sector organizations and holds a number of board assignments.

It can inspire creativity, but it can also kill it. We‚Äôve all heard the stories about the Google Creative Director resigning over testing 41 shades of blue or Jeff Bezos mentioning all his best decisions involved intuition and gut, not analysis. Of course, we need data and insights to create meaningful services, so that aim should be to find the balance between data-inspired, data-informed, and data-driven ways of working. In the field of design, we are looking for new ways to incorporate data into our process, and in some cases, AI can even do the job of designing. For example, here is how Airbnb has used to optimize the layout of the article.', 'How can we get the most out of using data when developing new products and services or engaging in other transformation efforts? Based on my relationship to data and my experiences as a designer in data-centric digital transformation projects, I‚Äôve formulated a relatively simple six-step process you can use to ensure the best possible result. The first three steps are at the organization level, while the later ones are at the team level.', '\nClick here for full size image', 'First, you need a clear data architecture map that indicates how data is exchanged between services, legacy systems, etc. This map is crucial for defining the current situation and future data strategy & governance.', 'Second, many organizations suffer from silo structures, making data less visible and harder to access across different products. Start by creating a data catalog both internal and external stakeholders can use*. Catalogue will help you to understand what data is missing and support your strategy. The catalog shows what data is available and from where: customer demographic and purchase behaviour data from legacy systems, service usage data, etc. The data catalog could, for example, deal in detail with attributes like:', '...and so on.', 'The catalog is used in new business ideation sessions across many products & services  as well as for creating quick prototypes.', 'After making the current data visible across the organization, the next step is to ensure that future data is collected correctly. Having clear written guidelines will help both internal product development and any work with partners. Data guidelines must cover best processes, practices and governance models from the following departments:', 'IT requirements, especially on the data architecture level\nLegal guidelines based on GDPR and other relevant requirements\nData regulations from the Data Science team within the organization', 'The team is the most critical success factor in a successful organisational change towards becoming more data-driven. A multi-disciplinary team setup is the best for working fast in an uncertain environment. The team has to be able to use data, i.e., combine it with customer insights to develop hypotheses that are tested quickly. Ideally, team members should not be involved with several other projects within the organization. Expectations and definitions of success must be clear. The team must also be able to plan its activities, with additional support. If the team has a dual role as a change agent, C-suite support may be needed. Finally, careful consideration must be given to team culture and personalities when picking the members.', 'The team defines its process based on its objectives. I have been involved in Hypothesis-Test-Result processes. Hypotheses are created based on data, customer insights, and market situation - or sometimes gut feeling. The important part is that the hypothesis can be sliced into measurable tests. The hypothesis can deal with the strategic or product feature level.', 'The primary purpose of doing tests is to find traction. Tests can be done using a clickable prototype, deployed on real product, or smoke tests that simulate ideas. Each test must be created and planned well, with carefully defined and measured success and failure criteria.', 'This part can get a little fuzzy and abstract sometimes, so it‚Äôs essential to ensure team morale remains high. Ideally, the process should be done in 2 weeks sprints. This phase‚Äôs processing should be rather straightforward, and results should be used for adjusting future experiments.', 'Example 1: Increase ARPU for existing customers\nThe team checks the data from various sources - own data, open data, and purchased data - and creates hypotheses. For example, if a customer lives in a neighborhood that has voted for the Green Party, orders email bills, this could give insights for customizing sales & marketing efforts. After the hypothesis is accepted, then data must be modeled to estimate business impact. If the calculated business impact is good, then execution starts.', 'Example 2: Test the value proposition of a new SaaS service.\nA smoke test is designed so that during the welcoming call of the new customers, salespeople pitched the new service as if it exists and asked would customers be interested in paying for it. If customers said yes, the salesperson records the information for later contact. It‚Äôs an effortless way to gauge the initial traction. Results are more reliable than typical validation sessions with a prototype since it is presented as a real product to real customers.', 'Test results must be mapped against KPI`s and carefully documented. The team looks at the results and updates the hypotheses - which would mean pivoting, or keeping the functions.', 'As designers we are continually adapting new ways of working, and there is no one-fits-all process but rather adaptations of many. In order to be resilient, we need to adapt our own skills to fit into the new era. We need to be able to use both qualitative and quantitative data points better in our design work.

Changing customer expectations combined with new regulations offer new opportunities, but companies in the sector need new capabilities to grasp them. The digital transformation of healthcare companies and the services and products is an especially important area, but a lot of the healthcare players are struggling. ', 'The good news is many industries have already gone through this process, so there‚Äôs a lot of knowledge and experience traditional pharmaceutical and medical technology companies can draw from.', 'Investing in ecosystems and data-driven solutions are one of the most important aspects of staying relevant in a changing market.', 'In other industries, digital transformation has offered companies an opportunity to launch new products, provide more value to customers, explore and create new business opportunities. The nature of the healthcare industry makes this equation a little harder. Companies have to contend with restrictive regulation, elevated concerns for data security, and general healthcare offering fragmentation. Even major tech companies have found it challenging. Google temporarily discontinued its Google Health initiative back in 2012 due to a lack of users.', 'But that was ten years ago. What was back then too complex to solve even for Google is within our grasp to tackle now. The market is a lot more mature now, and progress continues apace.', 'So what has changed?', 'One answer is customers.', 'The transformation processes other industries have undergone has created a widespread mindset change among users. In other areas of life, an increasing share of the products and services people use are digital and online. To look at just one of the earlier bottlenecks, a PwC study in 2016 found that 71% of patients were very open or open to letting service providers collect and use personal data in a healthcare context. The experiences of using high quality, seamless digital services in banking, mobility, and other sectors have created a growing demand for the same in healthcare. Especially with operating systems in the patient‚Äôs pocket, allowing for the integration of health devices and data, we are already moving towards a more holistic approach to build a healthcare ecosystem.', 'The bar is high, as is the pressure, but the opportunities are significant, too.', 'Another answer is the outside players entering the field. Both big tech players and startups are making the sector more competitive and accelerating the change.', 'In recent years tech companies have made significant investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions in data & analytics, genomics, and administration (CBInsights, 2019). This outside investment is putting pressure on the whole field to become more innovative. It‚Äôs a familiar phenomenon. Over the last decade, the same process took place in the automotive industry, with tech companies and startups entering the sector and driving innovation in engine technologies, autonomous vehicles, and new mobility and ownership approaches.', 'To stay relevant, established healthcare companies must accelerate their offering and internal processes‚Äô digitalisation.', 'A third factor beneficial to the digitalisation of the healthcare sector is a changing regulatory environment. Governments in Europe are supporting the industry by breaking down and removing barriers, promoting digitalisation and making the market more competitive.', 'Examples of good and bad, successful and unsuccessful, transformation abound in almost all industries. There are also different approaches to take. Diversifying and augmenting the core offering with attractive added-value services is widespread and often successful.', 'For example, in the manufacturing sector, Robert Bosch Power Tools, one of the world‚Äôs leading providers for power tools, power tool accessories and measuring tools, has created PRO360: a digital ecosystem of connected services to extend the core offering. Services, built on top of this platform, can easily share data with each other in real-time enabling a seamless user experience. Services and features offered in the ecosystem benefit all of Bosch core customer segments of professional Power Tools users.', 'In the automotive sector, companies whose core offering is the car complement it with digital services that support users‚Äô mobility needs ranging from payments, sharing, and parking to monitoring the vehicle‚Äôs status. The new services give car manufacturers an extended presence in the customers‚Äô lives and in different phases of the mobility journey. The services are usually a part of an ecosystem that provides customers with a seamless experience and collects data that can be shared across the ecosystem to increase the service providers‚Äô understanding of the customers‚Äô needs and behaviours. These ecosystems‚Äô complexity requires collaboration and partnerships between companies to leverage specific expertise and deliver a complete offering. An ecosystem of services is also an ecosystem of actors - companies, organisations, legislators, etc. that need to collaborate and evolve their common strategies to grow the ecosystem offering and provide better services for the benefit of all.', 'It‚Äôs one of the most critical lessons Pharma and Medtech companies can learn from other industries - how to enlarge the offering beyond the core product, create ecosystems of digital services and establish partnerships to become more resilient and face the upcoming changes in the market. Failing to act carries big risks. Healthcare is a rich market and will always attract a lot of investment. Investors can turn to new and disruptive players who launch products and services to address unmet patient needs beyond the immediate treatment. For example, the needs of patients who deal with regular therapies and chronic disease are an overlooked area of great importance in the holistic picture of medical treatment. In general, innovators enter the market by discovering and capturing uncovered opportunities along the patient journey. The services they offer often compete directly with established players. They challenge the status quo by informing and providing recommendations to patients for different therapeutic approaches.', 'Ecosystems and data-driven services offer Pharma and Medtech new opportunities to digitalise and diversify their offering. There are many parts of the current healthcare journey that are either fragmented or untouched by digitalisation. Traditionally, they‚Äôve focused on developing new drugs, devices, and treatments, using costly research and development processes in a very competitive and regulated market. But digitalisation and changes in the legislation allow companies to explore new opportunity areas.', 'However, companies need to change within to grasp these opportunities, to have an impact. Otherwise, they might not be able to react fast enough, agile enough, and patient-centric enough.', 'A new approach based on digital ecosystems and data-driven services will help healthcare industries unlock new revenue streams by providing holistic service solutions along the whole patient journey. Ecosystems connect different actors in collaboration for mutual benefit - and the benefit of the patient.', 'Currently, patients are exposed to a fragmented and often trying or stressful process to obtain their care.', '', 'Let‚Äôs say you have pain in your knee, to the point where you often have trouble walking. You decide to get help and visit a hospital. You explain your situation - several times - to a couple of nurses and then multiple doctors, who decide to run a series of tests to find out what‚Äôs wrong. You go through the tests and have a difficult time understanding the results. No one really explains them to you. You get a diagnosis for a chronic problem and you‚Äôre off on a journey that has changed very little over the past decades: doctor visits, medical tests, medicines. The experience is often fragmented, and at many points, you will probably fail to receive all the information and support needed to face the disease, especially when the problem is chronic, like diabetes, cardiovascular or rheumatic diseases, etc.', 'This needs to change and Pharma and Medtech companies are in a position to make it happen. New digital services can support the core products and help the patient, the doctors, and other stakeholders along the journey.', '', 'Pharma companies can improve the efficacy of the treatments not only with better drugs but also with digital supportive services. For example, Pharma players can create services to improve the coordination of different healthcare providers. Innovators can use data to improve the treatment path. They can develop services to support caregivers and families, but also to help you, as a patient, to improve your quality of life by adopting healthy nutrition habits. Digital services can also help you to prepare the visit to the doctor and keep track of the symptoms. Other supplementary services can support in following the prescribed treatment correctly. The ecosystem keeps both you and the healthcare professionals up to speed and on the same page. Digital solutions are connected to create an ecosystem that helps you along the journey of finding out what ails you and the following treatment.', 'At the same time, Medtech actors invest in the ecosystem by connecting medical devices to the integrated digital platform. The digitalisation of processes improves efficiency, reduces costs, and cuts down on human errors. According to research by Simon-Kurcher, over 70% of Medtech companies face price pressures, coupled with increasing costs in the market. Only 18% of companies are planning on increasing prices because this strategy has not worked in the past. Instead, they are investing in the digitalisation of services and products to reduce costs. As of today, 56% of companies register a positive impact on sales.', 'The data you and the healthcare professionals undertaking your care provide in the ecosystem is analysed, providing new insight into your health to you and all the stakeholders working with improving your health. The handling of your medical results is more efficient, and your health status is communicated consistently and clearly.', 'The holistic, ecosystem-based, and data-driven approach replaces the previous fragmented journey and helps provide better care and increased peace of mind. Given enough volume, there‚Äôs the potential for a more significant impact, too: data and statistics from a larger group can provide new insights into health and treatment.', 'For the service providers, connecting devices and digital services into an ecosystem will help Pharma and Medtech companies leverage the business value offered by data and develop better solutions and products. At the same time, the flexible infrastructure of an ecosystem will provide more resilience and allow cost reduction. A flexible and modular infrastructure will also enable companies to quickly develop services and integrate them into the ecosystem over time with relatively low investment costs. Companies can react quickly to emerging needs or problems (pandemic breakout), adapt fast to market changes and stay relevant on the market by continually delivering value.', 'Over the last few years, we‚Äôve started seeing the emergence of digital innovation and ecosystems in the healthcare sector, but there are still lots of opportunities to explore. The future, with its pandemics, economic crises, and repeated cycles of disruptive innovation will continue to challenge the healthcare sector.', 'Digital ecosystems and data-driven innovation, together with a new holistic approach to therapies and addressing previously unmet patient needs, will help the industry thrive. This approach will help healthcare companies find success by minimising business risks, innovating quickly and delivering new treatments in challenging situations.', 'If you want to learn more about our healthcare approach, check out our Health page and get familiar with our healthcare ecosystems assessment!']",[]

Digitalisation and optimisation of internal processes provide companies with opportunities to cut costs and add to the resilience of the healthcare industry ‚Äì especially within the supply chain.\n', 'The scale of the COVID-19 pandemic took the world and also the healthcare industry by surprise. Lurking behind the current worldwide emergency, however, are certain massive longer-term changes the healthcare landscape is already facing.', 'Some of these changes are initiated by new technologies as big tech giants move into the healthcare field. Google, Amazon and other technology behemoths are willing to leverage their focus on consumer experience, their platform and their back end infrastructure. Amazon, for example, has a direct distribution advantage to over 300M active customers, and approximately 5M sellers on the site. Competing with big tech companies whose strategy is not even dependent on making a profit in healthcare is creating a major risk for the traditional healthcare players.', 'There are also legal and regulatory changes that restrict entrepreneurial activity and increase pressures especially on hospitals. These restrictions and pressures have implications on the entire healthcare industry, as med tech and pharma, for example, provide a significant part of their services to hospitals. Competition between hospital providers will increase and services must be rendered more cost-effectively.', 'In addition, certain changes actually have a lot to do with the ongoing pandemic. For one, COVID-19 has promoted uncertainty in the healthcare system. The supply chain‚Äôs inability to deliver has been made public. During the crisis, this problem that has been seen in the pharmaceutical sector since longer expanded to essential protective materials. Other basic supply areas were also affected due to production locations in Asia.', 'While many healthcare manufacturers are now working to diversify their product lines and target markets to adapt to these changes in the healthcare landscape, cost pressures and the pandemic are forcing them to operate more efficiently as well as to track and distribute their specific medical devices much faster and efficiently.', 'Amid these changes shaking the healthcare landscape, how can pharmaceutical or medical device companies become more resilient and cost-effective?', 'Only labour costs surpass those of the supply chain in the healthcare industry. Since there is already a skill shortage within healthcare professionals, the focus of cost reductions lies squarely on the procurement of medical supplies. For example in German hospitals material costs make over 30 percent of gross overall costs, so any supply chain overspend will have a big impact.', 'Managing the supply chain in healthcare tends to be a highly complex and fragmented process. A more integrated, centralised process would result in great savings as well as better purchasing decisions.', 'One big challenge to more efficiency of contracts and commercial effort lies in the communication and interaction with the sales teams and distributors. While other industries have moved on to product scanning, electronic ordering, and order accuracy controls, in the healthcare industry order management in particular is one of the biggest costs in the supply chain. Due to manual processes mistakes in order management cause issues with inventory accuracy, resulting in a failure to provide the right product at the right place at the right time. Processes within the supply chain may also harbor issues in compliance and impact patient safety and visibility.', 'The supply chains within the healthcare field need to offer greater standardisation and efficiency ‚Äì not only to save costs and time within the healthcare manufacturer, but also to deliver safer, more cost-effective benefits for patients. But how to achieve this?', 'Cloud, mobile technology and IoT sensors would enable automated processes with increased end-to-end transparency on real-time costs, and business value. By re-designing cross-functional processes and enablement through digital technologies, costs and inefficiencies within healthcare supply chains can be reduced drastically.', 'For example, monitoring the supply by connected devices that communicate with each other would allow automatic re-ordering of required items on demand and ensure they are re-stocked without demand ever becoming critical. This would mean the sales forecasting is no longer disconnected from the inventory buffers and no longer manual.', 'To achieve this, the supply chain management needs to be focused on data-driven efficiency. The shift from manual processes, which need an inventory buffer to account for uncertainty, to a JIT (just-in-time) system is enabled by data (data integration) and easy-to-monitor solutions (service design). These elements allow anticipatory shipping, dynamic pricing and recommendations to customers to drive sales of stocked items.', '', 'A truly data-driven approach can uncover large potential savings as the data can be used to analyse the supply chain itself and show where are the inefficiencies that need to be managed better. This digital ecosystem enables the connection of the healthcare manufacturers to the distributors, as well as the providers. It allows visualization of the data within the supply chain to keep track of the orders and facilitate communication. Sharing data throughout the supply chain would make it less fragmented, more resilient and better integrated so that manual processes are not needed anymore. With more information available and shared across stakeholders, cooperation has less friction.', '', 'Many healthcare companies are well on their way in their digital transformation but if their digital initiatives are very fragmented, the impact may often get stuck in silos or scatter too thinly across the organisation. To scale the positive impact throughout the organisation and its supply chain, all digital initiatives need strong C-level support, a clear strategy including data and IT, as well as a transformation process with new business design.', 'A clear data strategy could define secure and scalable cloud-based systems that enable remote monitoring and controlling, checking on performance and immediately tracking down faults. A holistic dashboard could help align processes, increase visual management and improve day to day routines using data-driven methods and connecting data sources from quality, finance, and scheduling, for example. Analysing the data from distributors and providers will allow manufacturers to adapt the supply chain more holistically. The data would feed into a platform that connects multiple actors and touch points of the supply chain and thus create a digital ecosystem. Internal and external data sources make real-time demand and supply shaping possible. Dynamics between supply and demand can be shown in real time by analyzing inventory, production, and point of sale (POS) data. This allows adaptations like changing the price or promoting specific products.', 'Futurice has promoted digital transformation and successfully applied the ecosystem approach in collaborations across many industries. As an example, we helped E.ON gain a considerable market share in the solar panel industry and develop new business models and services. We started by identifying the opportunity areas in the solar market and prioritising them by keeping the service vision in mind. We built a digital ecosystem that helped E.ON reduce the process from acquisition to installation sensibly: promote solar panels online, profile potential customers through the solar calculator, put them in touch with the right sales agent and manage the installation digitally. Data collected along the journey helped to optimise the process and provide support to the customer in the following stages.', 'A similar approach would help Healthcare companies optimize internal processes, too. Using a Lean Service Creation approach, and then scaling what works has the benefit of targeting the efforts to key initiatives. This method also enables the right environment for experimentation. Cross-functional teams consisting of talent from tech, data, business and design run quick test-and-learn cycles to build a minimum viable product that can then be iterated and scaled. For departments this often means managing faster experimentation cycles, while simultaneously also managing the previous tasks for cost and reliability.', 'Fostering a strong culture of innovation is essential to thrive in any industry, and healthcare is no exception. New initiatives are able to create more cross-departmental, agile, and iterative teams and bring the culture change from within, more organically and sustainably. To sustain change and reach their goals, healthcare organisations need the right mindset, the right culture, and the right tools and methodologies.', 'Data, AI and digital tools enable new advancements in the management of supply chains, but only if organisations within the healthcare field are willing to break their silos.

In a regulated and relatively traditional space, this is just one example where the players in healthcare spend lots of resources working with processes or systems that do not offer adequate value or efficiency in the era of digitalisation.', 'What could be done to save this precious time ‚Äì and money ‚Äì and use it for something more valuable such as time spent with patients, doing research or developing new products and services?', 'The answer in short is to create digital services that both renew and expedite the current processes in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries and make them more customer-centric, data-driven and collaborational between healthcare stakeholders.', 'While the healthcare and medical industry is very advanced in terms of medical science, technology and research, it is still quite traditional in terms of communication and collaboration. This is exactly where digital services could make a huge impact and change for the better. The demand can be seen in the data as well; according to The Future Health Index by Philips, 79% of healthcare professionals agree that digital tech is an important tool to achieve better patient outcomes and 74% believe that digital tech will also improve the experience for patients.', '', 'So how should healthcare players start building these digital services, then? To help with getting to work and taking that brave first step, here are the three key approaches to successful digital service development that we at Futurice think are crucial.', '', 'The first step in creating better digital services is to take a good look at your most important customer. Are they patients? Focus on finding out what their needs are. Are they doctors or nurses? See what pain points and needs they have in their daily work. Putting the customer first makes it easiest to start leveraging business opportunities where most needed.', 'To understand one‚Äôs customer, you need to research how different user groups and stakeholders act and live. This is not always easy in a space as regulated and sensitive as healthcare. That in mind, there should be a healthy time investment set aside for customer research. Understanding the customer and their needs will give you a head start in finding the best ideas for the right solutions. Conversely, dismissing the needs of a key stakeholder can lead you along the wrong path and towards a solution that does not actually solve the customer‚Äôs problem.', 'It is also important to remember that in the complex healthcare landscape being customer-focused means not just catering for the needs of the primary end-user but everyone in the process. Even if the patient is the main user, we need to look who else is involved in the workflow. A new tool or solution should be useful for all the stakeholders. If the tool is great for patients but annoys doctors or increases workload for nurses, there can be a massive barrier for adoption.', 'A common vision for the healthcare industry today is to use data to provide personalized and predictive healthcare. Healthcare and medical industry players can build holistic service networks, connect different data sources to one another and apply technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict diseases before they even happen, and finally give highly personalized recommendations to patients.', 'Sounds great, doesn‚Äôt it? Unfortunately, this is still somewhat aspirational and very hard to achieve. Fortunately no one in the industry has quite tackled the technical challenges around privacy, security and data quality yet ‚Äì so there is still room for a pioneering trailblazer to reap the early rewards.', 'The first step towards tackling the challenges is to develop a scalable data and tech strategy that goes hand in hand with any new digital services that will eventually be built. Data should be viewed as a tool to learn more about customers, improve services and increase retention as well as compliance. Finally, a clear data strategy will allow healthcare industry players to get an overview of the data they have, bring order to it and discover new, actionable insights continuously. One great example of this is Techniker Krankenkasse. They offer an optional digital health record for their customers, which allows patients to have an overview of their health data and help professionals to get an overview of their patients as well.', 'Partnerships are not yet the norm in the healthcare and medical industry, where many have historically protected their valuable expertise from competition. This is now beginning to change, however, as we have learned from other industries.', ""Collaborating in an ecosystem with partners is necessary to complete one's offering. This could mean partnerships with startups, tech companies or other healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. Partnerships in digital service design are essential, because building everything alone is too expensive, complex and risky. We are already seeing pharmaceutical companies team up with tech giants, like Novartis and Microsoft or Pfizer and IBM. Techniker Krankenkasse also worked with IBM to create their digital health record for customers. In today‚Äôs complex and rapidly transforming markets, there is an inherent risk in developing everything alone. Furthermore, fragmented services tend to create unnecessary friction for the end-users and are not adopted as widely as hoped."", 'To sum it up, the customer-focused, data-driven and partnership-building healthcare and medical players are the ones that will surely succeed in building the kinds of digital services that patients, healthcare professionals and other stakeholders will embrace most dearly. What healthcare companies need now is the courage to be the first in this field to take these crucial first steps and get ahead of the competition ‚Äì or else others will take these steps before you.', '', 'Hopefully this article was a thought-provoking read.

There is no need for me to go to the doctor‚Äôs office and wait for hours in a room full of other sick people when I have a mild flu ‚Äì talking to doctors remotely is the new normal.', 'But digital care can do more than just treating little aches and pains: We see a lot of specialized services offering a fully digital care plan for chronic diseases. Users consult specialists remotely and are guided through recovery processes with digital applications.', 'In parallel, the focus of care is shifting to prevention ‚Äì according to recent McKinsey findings, 70% of efficiency gains in healthcare will be made by acting before a critical health condition occurs. This opens up further opportunities around helping users to develop healthy habits and detecting individual risks early on.', 'All this is enabled by a previously unavailable transparency on people‚Äôs daily health. Until now, doctors had to measure health and assess an individual‚Äôs health risks - they created a quite costly one-time snapshot.

However, only few organizations follow and execute this mantra.', 'But what does that actually mean? Healthcare needs to avoid mistakes other industries did. Simply reproducing existing processes in digital environments won‚Äôt satisfy consumers. All processes need to be rethought and adjusted for a ‚Äúdigital first‚Äù world. Yes, this is stressful and demands a real mindset change in the organizations of traditional players. However, providing the greatest added value for individual users will also open up new options to increase revenue.', 'The road ahead is clear and all verticals of the healthcare industry will be affected: Health insurances need to transition from payor to partner and strengthen their prevention efforts. MedTech and Pharma need to provide services, not just products and pills, to improve the value they deliver. And hospitals and doctors need to connect to users outside their premise, to ensure the most efficient utilization of their infrastructure', 'What role do data security and privacy concerns play in digital health services?', 'This is an incredibly important topic. Health information is highly sensitive and needs special protection to prevent misuse and discrimination. The industry already has a strong ecosystem of specialists and service providers for data security and privacy. When  designing new processes and products, privacy aspects need to be incorporated early by service providers to help to avoid major obstacles.', 'Which other technologies do you see as the biggest promises in the health sector and how can they improve efficiency?', ""Sensors. Each and every one of us collects plenty of data which is valuable for health care today. Whether it's with a smartphone, a wearable such as the Apple Watch, or with a networked blood glucose meter. It‚Äôs a push in technology, that is coming from all directions. Consumer devices manufacturers incorporate health-sensors, classic medical devices manufacturers add connectivity and research extracts new health-data from existing sensors. This continuous data is all but the decisive building block for tomorrow‚Äôs healthcare - a truly holistic view on people‚Äôs health."", 'Health data from sensors allows to treat people as an individual, to understand their circadian rhythm, to identify changes in health status quickly, to take proactive measures and ultimately, to measure outcome objectively.', 'Looking at the changes on the health market - how do you evaluate the importance of partnerships, for example between Start-Ups and traditional corporates?', 'Healthcare is one of the most regulated industries in the world. You can‚Äôt just ignore all the existing rules and try to disrupt everything. The industry has traditionally favored strong (international) partnerships. The digital health sector works the same way. A great example is how telemedicine providers partnered early with local doctors, as well as health insurances to gain traction among patients.', 'However, partnerships only work as equals - we frequently hear from colleagues that the old players often decorate themselves with start-up cooperation‚Äôs, while in fact the projects are never implemented. This blocks the much-needed transition towards a more accessible and individually effective health service.', 'What is needed from the legal authorities and the government to support these opportunities?', 'The legal hurdles for the use of reimbursement of digital solutions are still quite high. But not everything is bad: Germany just introduced new legislation, that provides universal reimbursement digital applications that fulfill a defined set of criteria. Providers can market their solutions early as part of the primary health care, but need to provide continuous transparency on outcomes to reduce the risk for the payor. This is a prime example of the way, modern healthcare should work ‚Äì providing the best service possible, while offering an easy entry for innovation that benefits patients and society. This is a first step towards a value-based healthcare system.', 'Although the reimbursement got much easier in Germany, it is not in most other countries.

In an interview with Futurice, he reveals his personal vision for autonomous driving and explains how [micro mobility](https://futurice.com/blog/as-micromobility-matures-controversy-turns-into-collaboration) could continue even outside the city centers. \n', 'The German industry has very strong experience in building well engineered mobility hardware. How can they best leverage this to continue shaping mobility in the future? Or will new business opportunities be led by others?', 'German corporates do not only stand strong in engineering. Innovative local companies also have a strong foothold in mobility services that might become more relevant in the future. Regarding autonomous driving technology, it‚Äôs taking longer to deploy robo-taxis than everyone expected. Nevertheless, some local industry players like OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers are playing an important role in developing, producing and deploying the technologies needed for autonomous driving. New entrants like tech players or mobility services may also engage in the market and at the end we might see more collaborations and cooperation between involved stakeholders. Incumbents have also gained a lot of trust by consumers, politics and local authorities ‚Äì a value that should not be underestimated in the process of deploying autonomous driving technology.', 'Looking at autonomous driving - Where do you see opportunities for car manufacturers compared to global tech companies? ', 'Car manufacturers have extensive experience in engineering, quality assurance and production at scale. I could see scenarios where car manufacturers, tech companies and other stakeholders partner to deliver the mobility solutions that consumers expect. As mentioned above, car manufacturers and the related brands have a strong reputation that can be a huge asset to gain trust from consumers and public stakeholders.', 'You are a big advocate of micromobilty that is currently very present in city centers. How do you see its potential for suburban areas and how will it change commuting?', 'I think shared micro mobility might further spread to smaller cities, as it could be seen in Europe and North America. Station based micro mobility systems that are possibly supported by the local government could see adoption in suburban areas as well. Already today, we see that cities leverage their influence in tender processes and enforce service operators to deploy certain thresholds of micro mobility vehicles in less dense areas and suburbs.', 'As the variety of electrified micro mobility vehicles (bikes, kick scooters, mopeds) is expanding in retail channels, the role of self-owned micro mobility vehicles for commuting is also increasing. Thanks to E-bikes and scooters, covering longer commuting distances is becoming more convenient.', 'Suburban areas are on the rise and involved stakeholders need to find ways to allow car free commuting - from growing suburban areas into the city centers.', 'Following our previous question, how will mobility in more rural areas change?', 'The personal car might remain the primary mode of choice in rural areas. For private mobility service providers the density of people is too low to offer sustainable services at acceptable costs. However, I could imagine that public transit operators will become more active in exploring and testing services like DRT (demand-responsive transport) systems to complement the existing public transport offering, maybe replacing some of their traditional bus lines later on.', 'How can integrated ecosystems and partnerships help to stay relevant in the mobility market?', 'Integrated ecosystems and partnerships are a hot topic on public policy levels. As a service provider, being open for partnerships and integrations can have a positive impact on relations to local decision makers. Some cities have already decided that service providers need to get integrated in platforms if they want to operate in the market.', 'Both - ecosystems and partnerships - play an important role. Some heavy asset mobility services could use integrated ecosystems to increase the utilization of their vehicles. Additional customers may help to reduce the idle time of the vehicles and increase the revenue potential.', 'Mobility service providers often have expert knowledge in one specific vehicle service of the whole mobility bandwidth. However, most consumers using mobility services are relying on more than one vehicle to fulfill their mobility needs. Partnering with complementary services (e.g. a partnership between a car sharing and a micro mobility operator) could add value for the users and also generate additional revenue potential.', 'Integrated ecosystems and partnerships are also a hot topic on public policy levels. Being open for partnerships and integrations can have a positive impact on relations to local decision makers. Some cities have already decided that service providers need to get integrated in platforms if they want to operate in the market.', 'Looking at intermodal transportation - where do you see the biggest challenges?', 'In the past, the discussion has often been driven by technology. Tech startups and PTAs wanted to showcase all the intermodal platforms that can possibly be built. They assumed that once the platforms were built, customers would follow naturally.  But we can see in most of the MaaS markets that usage is limited and customer adoption is slow.', 'Therefore, the biggest challenge is to provide an experience for consumers that is as reliable and flexible as owning a personal car.

Once the world is fully autonomous and connected, the business potential of data and business intelligence could increase.', 'Today, mobility service providers could and should use data to improve the performance of their services. Data could be used to increase the customer experience, e.g. by providing the right level of service at the right time. In addition, data points could also be utilized to increase the unit economics and business related KPIs of a service. And don‚Äôt forget the potential of collected data points to enhance the digital product as well as internal processes.', 'On a city level, data of multiple public and private services, general traffic flow data and others could be combined to identify weak spots in the local transportation setup and to define further budgets and projects for the mobility system and infrastructure.

Learn more about Christian's view on the developments in the mobility market.\n"", 'Looking at ongoing changes in the German mobility landscape, what are the biggest trends and needs you are observing?', 'Looking at the landscape of air, train and bus travel, we have seen that the air and train travel industries were booming, while the bus segment was seeing a different development. Even though air travel has reached its capacities due to limited availability of plane slots at airports, the industry has been thriving before Covid-19 and train routes were also successfully pushed to maximum frequencies. On the contrary, bus travel has been barely growing after a double digit growth from 2013 and 2018. \nThis is actually surprising as bus transport doesn‚Äôt have to deal with the same strict regulations as air or train travel. However, bad user experiences and increasing prices have led to the fact that bus transport wasn‚Äôt growing as expected anymore. That is why we saw an increasing need for a truly customer-centric bus travel service.', 'What would you see as the three key elements everyone should consider when creating a new mobility service?', 'From my perspective every new mobility service should be focused on:', 'With your company, Pinkbus, you are connecting people on the long distance. What made you decide to start a new long distance bus line? ', 'Back in 2015, two years after long distance coach lines were introduced to the German market, express bus customers (ca. 30% of the bus market at the time) switched back to train services - mainly because of unexpected long travel times due to ‚Äûhidden stops‚Äú on bus routes. We wanted to offer a real alternative to train and plane services by cutting out hidden stops and reducing travel time on bus routes.', 'In the context of long distance travel, what role do ecosystems play?', 'They have an essential role: Customers look at the full travel route prior to booking a long distance trip. If you offer the best long distance service but the ecosystem doesn‚Äôt support this service, customers will still turn to competitors who offer them a better or more convenient experience. You could compare it with cheap air travel services where customers turn away from the service because of expensive parking at the airport or a remote airport location.', '', 'How have customer needs changed during your time operating in the mobility field and how do companies need to adapt?', 'When long distance services became more popular in Germany around 2013, they were able to fulfill a big need of their customers. However, since 2015 long distance coach express customers started to switch again from bus services back to mainly train services. As it was faster for them and could also compete from a price perspective. To work against this trend, long distance bus operators should focus on winning back the express customer from train and plane services by being even more customer-centric and listening even more to their customer‚Äôs needs.', 'The need for a working mobility ecosystem is closely related to sustainable goals. Which steps do you think are to be taken within the bus travel industry?', 'There are two main factors influencing a customer choosing a specific mode of transportation: speed and price. In our industry, however, travel time can usually only be reduced in the long run. For example, if faster planes are built or train tracks are of better quality, so that trains can go at a higher speed. This means that, in the short and medium run, mobility companies need to have a closer look at how to reduce operational costs and therefore offer lower prices. This asks for mobility companies to become extremely efficient with their operations and products. Take Tier as an example: Tier is doing a great job by further developing their own scooter to increase the scooter‚Äôs lifetime.', 'Data is already extremely important in the planning process of new mobility services. When developing a new route for long distance bus travel we need to know how many people are traveling on the desired route and which mode of transportation they are currently using and why. Without these touchpoints, route expansion would simply be trial and error.', 'Thinking about data - how important is data for your mobility business now and for the mobility of the future?', 'Data is extremely important as it is already needed when planning new mobility services. At Pinkbus, we need to know how many people are traveling on the desired new route and which mode of transportation they are currently using and why -  in order to develop new routes. Without these touchpoints, route expansion simply turns into trial and error - eventually costing much more than sufficient data would. While operating a service, mobility companies continuously need to have a close look at the available data  to detect shifting consumer behavior. Only this way, they will be able to adapt their services to their customer‚Äôs needs.', 'About Christian H√∂ber\n\nChristian already grew up with buses as his father owns a small transport company and operated part of the public transportation network for the city of Paderborn.

Here are a few things I‚Äôve learned from the online sessions.', 'There are essential differences between a remote and a traditional design critique that need to be taken into account to get the results you want. The tools used at a design critique held in-person usually include printouts, post-it notes, and dot stickers. Live sessions also always provide opportunities for 1-to-1 exchanges of thoughts between the participants.', 'Remote sessions are different. You can substitute printouts and post-its for on-screen presentation and native commenting tools or digital emulations of notes. But most commonly used conference tools do not support ad hoc 1-on-1 discussions during sessions. Usually, everyone is just yelling in a ‚Äòroom‚Äô.', 'Following is my advice for working around the shortcomings of the remote environment and getting the most out of your remote critique sessions.', 'Before\nWhatever can be done in advance instead of using remote session time should be done. Introduce the attendees to the designs as well as guidelines for giving critiques before each session. Use a collaborative tool with a low learning curve that fits the task. Specify a limited time window for the critique giving to avoid a flood of commentary and to give equal starting point to the session for each of the participants.', 'During\nA brief introduction is followed by an opportunity for each attendee to highlight what they consider their most important piece of critique. One by one. The discussion should take place right after each comment, and the rounds go on as long as needed.', 'Despite its shortcomings, video conferencing does support group discussion. The dynamics of the situation are different with the usual sound delays and connection breakages. It‚Äôs important to take clear turns and slow down the overall pace. Allowing every attendee a turn to go through their comments gives them the chance to lead the discussion. Being aware of the changing roles during the session is essential.', 'If you are limited availability for shared session time, a virtual session is possible. The discussion happens over a extended period of time inside each piece of commentary as a replies in a written form. Do note, that a ‚Äòsilent session‚Äô requires more preparations and guidance as the attendees facilitate themselves.', 'A 1-to-1 exchange of thoughts during critiques is every bit as important as the critique itself. It opens the way for a deeper understanding than what can be read from a few lines of commentary. During the discussions, all attendees also gain new insights and ideas for their design projects. In the long run, this benefits the collective quality of the design. Without discussion, it‚Äôs just everybody saying whatever comes to mind.', 'Whichever kind of session you choose to run, be sure to reserve time to conclude and set action points and the next steps, so attendees feel that they have contributed to your work. And remember to thank everyone for participating.', 'After\nDecide how to best utilise the gained insights and ideas. It is important to follow-up with the participants regardless of whether session helped improve the design work or shifted it in to a new direction. Participants deserve to gain an understanding of their impact and, in my opinion, it helps continue the discussion of how critiques can make a difference. Analysing the impact on you in this way also enables you to understand the implications of the critique you may give on someone else‚Äôs work.', 'Summary\nAlways keep in mind that human contact and all the small discussions are the most important and revealing part of a critique session.

I find the technology very interesting as it works both a visual communication tool and as a low code rapid development system. It excels at long running operations and has a focus on reliability and observability. The supporting tooling that allows querying running processes both graphically and/or via REST APIs.', 'The tool I built here for evaluation purposes touches on many BPMN concepts and would serve as a useful introduction if you would like to learn more about a different way of producing cross service applications.', ""I have a hypothesis that writing a load of code is no longer the best path for developing internal tools. Generally, there are so many polish products out there now, that even if you spend a fortune, you won't get very good results. It's not about execution ability or resourcing. Basically a product company can refine feedback from many customers, and thus can figure out the right level of abstraction. This leads to a feedback driven development process that is strictly superior when compared to a single customer internal tool. Internal tools overfit their organization and then become resistant to the inevitable change."", ""So now I think the best path to great tooling is stitching together existing products under a common UX. Every company has its own set of regulatory and historical context. No product company can fully cater to every company's product context (e.g. choice of CMS), infact, product companies should focus exclusively on their domain niche. So to create the best performing suite of tools for your employees, you need to plumb separate best-in-class tools together. If you can create a seamless experience across the suite, your employees will be happy, productive and ultimately provide competitive advantage for your organization."", 'To get to this nirvana, you need technologies that combine. You want products that expose APIs, understand URLs, and offer machine readable specifications (OpenAPI, gRPC). You also need glue to stitch them together. This article is about trying out Camunda BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) as the glue to build a non-trivial and useful cross service application.', 'My employer, Futurice, has a selection of internal tools and policies which are broadly typical for a modern technology company, namely:', 'Thus I felt I could add value to the company by delivering Google Analytics data to blog authors via the UX of choice, Slack. This would add a feedback loop from blog publishing to impact, which would hopefully help people write better in the long term.', 'Furthermore, by generating a standard content report, we could make comparisons across content pieces easier, and, as the report was a stable URL, it provides an easily shared artifact for inclusion at performance review time.', 'In the end, I used the following technologies:', ""This kind of application is in an interesting area. It is small, most of the complexity is in 3rd party software, it can provide genuine value, but is not really the kind of thing a product company can deliver, being too specific to the organizational context. It was a great application to see how well Camunda BPMN can work as a low code integration glue. It's a good choice as it is probably more complex than what you could do with Zapier, and also, I felt I led to a defensible story for secret storage."", '', 'In this article, I will concentrate on how the application was expressed as a BPMN configuration (step 4).

If you want to skip the minutiae I suggest heading straight to The Finished Application near the end.', ""To detect when a new blog is published, we start with a common website feature: RSS. It's a very useful technology for event driven automation over the internet. An RSS feed provides an XML summary of new content which can be polled and parsed fairly easily. That said, monitoring poll loops is not so fun so we delegate this task to Zapier and their ops team. (outsourcing RSS polling is a good example of pushing operation complexity to specialized 3rd parties, which I think is the future of development)."", '', ""Zapier lets you write simple rules that do some action on an event. In our case, when a new blog is published we want it to trigger a BPMN business workflow. We opted to create a custom internal Zapier app for this, as a basic webhook did not seem to provide the security I wanted. Custom apps can be secured via Oauth 2.0 which is nicer. To my surprise, custom apps are also allowed in the free tier, so the Zapier monthly cost is $0, and we didn't have to host a poll loop!"", 'When a new RSS entry appears, our Zap posts a signal to the Camunda REST API, with the title and link as parameters. (see the Camunda docs - Throw a Signal)', 'Before the main long running content workflow process is started, we run it through a small preparatory workflow step (full source).', '', 'The purpose of the preparatory step is to: 1. set the business key, 2. provide an additional entrance point for manually triggering it, and 3. set the downstream slack channel to be used. The workflow takes a signal trigger by Zapier, and rethrows a very similar signal. A signal in BPMN is a broadcast event.', 'With Camunda you can give a running process a ""business key"", which serves as a primary index. This has performance implications when processes try to communicate, but more importantly, a business key gives a running process a useful name. This is extremely useful for debugging in production. \nAs our workflows revolve around blog content, which is served on a unique URL, we use the URI as the businessKey (e.g. blog/from-office-to-space). Thus, in the preparatory workflow, we extract the path in a 2 line script (decode url).', 'With the path variable now set, we can throw another signal, but this time with the business key set to the value of the path variable (NewBlogPostKey).', 'While it is possible to set the business key in Zapier through the Camunda signal REST API, I felt this was an abstraction leak and wanted to keep Zapier implementation simple.', 'As mentioned, the point of setting the business key is so to improve the ergonomics of Camunda production monitoring. Camunda has this amazing monitoring tool called Cockpit which shows what processes are running for a given process definition and version. By setting the business key it is trivial to figure out the purpose of an individual process, i.e. what content is the process about', '', 'As well as setting the business key, the other interesting feature of this preparatory process is the inclusion of a manual start event wired to a ""test"" script task. In production things are signal triggered, but by including a non-signal start event I can manually invoke a test process straight from the Camunda process drawing tool Modeler. The test script allows me to manually set the title and link variables and then kick off the normal blog post workflow. Thus, I can skip using Zapier which is useful for testing, or for manual backfill.', '', 'Because spamming employees with messages is extremely annoying in an organization. The eagle eyed reader will notice the output signal includes an additional variable ""channel"". This informs the downstream workflow which Slack room to post to. Thus when testing, I post messages exclusively to a private channel in Slack. This reminds me of dependancy injection.', 'Now we reach the core workflow. The core purpose is to help our content authors monitor and maximize the impact of their work. Our workflow does a few things', 'The idea that we have a single thread per blog, which organizes useful activities related to that content in a single place.', 'Here is the workflow in its BPMN representation in all its glory, the full source including the scripts is available at on Github', '', 'Like in the preparatory workflow, we have two entrance points, one for the event driven signal ultimately originating from Zapier, and the other for manual triggering.', ""The first common step, Get Secret, retrieves a Slack bot's secret via a subprocess. This subprocess is two REST GET calls, one to the GCP local metadata server to get an access token, the second to Google Secret Manager to actually fetch the secret. Google Secret Manager base64 encodes the secret in the returned JSON payload, so we have to base64 decode it before writing the plain text secret to a variable secret (trivial to script in Groovy)."", '', 'I used a code generator to produce BPMN element templates from OpenAPI endpoints specs, so all the variables to JSON marshalling and unmarshalling are handled automatically. See openapi2modeler.ts.', ""After obtaining a Slack secret, the next step starts a new chat thread in the passed in channel. Like most APIs Slack provides an OpenAPI specification so it's simply a matter of filling out the text, channel and token fields.

Slack's own UX unfurls the URL to render a preview of the content."", ""Slack responds to the REST call with a lot of data, but most relevant is the ts field which identifies the newly created thread. We unmarshall Slack's postMessage response and bind the ts to a process variable with the same name."", '', 'As a side note, all these variable values can be inspected at runtime graphically using the excellent Camunda Cockpit (and also programmatically via the REST API).', '', 'After starting a Slack thread about a new content piece, we read the wallclock time and business key and put the startDate and URL path into variables for later.', 'At this point the content thread is setup! What happens next depends on external events. We split execution using a BPMN parallel gateway into 4 paths.', '', 'I really like how trivial it is to wait for long periods of time in a BPMN process. Process state is committed to a relational store as the workflow executes, so the workflow engine can be restarted without losing progress. Infact, as we host the engine in a serverless container, our engine is frequently restarted.', 'The event loop starts with an event-based gateway. This pauses execution until something external happens. In our case, we wait to catch a related tweet message. For our use case we want to signal that the Futurice marketing department tweeted something about the content piece.', '', 'After a related tweet BPMN message we post a Slack message to the content thread, then merge execution to an inclusive gateway. The inclusive gateway is not really necessary when you have jsut one event, but it demonstates how to scale the event loop with lots of event types. Ultimately, after the tweet is processed we go back to the event gateway to wait for the next event.', 'Messages, unlike signals, are 1-to-1 interprocess communication mechanisms. Our Tweet message is thrown by different process that listens to Twitter.', 'We use Zapier to listen to our public Twitter account (@futurice) and post a signal to our engine for every tweet that occurs. Another BPMN process, the TwitterRouter, listens to this signal and looks for content URLs in Tweet contents.', '', ""To see if a Tweet is related to a blog post, we look at the Tweet'a hypelinks. Annoyingly, Twitter automatically shortens URLs, so we follow the shortened URLs until they stop redirecting. This is scriptible using Java API and Groovy. Eventually, we can extract the URI, and sometimes this will match the business key of a running workflow."", ""After extracting the URI we make a decision based on a process query , filtered by business key. If we can find a process with a matching business key, we send a message to it. To aid debugging, we post non-matched Tweets to a debugging room in Slack (which I can manually verify that it's a true negative)"", 'Full source is here.', 'One of the main features of the workflow is to provide simple analytics to the content writer. The actual implementation in BPMN is very simple, we post a dynamic link on our content thread which links to Data Studio.', '', ""It's simplicity exemplifies the power of the URL and having tools that really, and I mean really, understands the sanctity of the URL. Google, being a marquee web company, does URL based technology extremely well. A good web service will encode its state in the URL, so that when shared, the receiver will see the same view. We use this effect to create a URL that opens into a Data Studio Dashboard with the filters prefilled to the content piece and date range of relevance."", 'The first step is to build a general purpose dashboard that contains enough controls to summarize our Google Analytics data for any content piece at any point in time. Here are the broad steps to setup Google Datastudio.', ""Google Data Studio is a good example of a federated data technology. You don't need to copy data into it, it fetches on demand. So step one is to add Google Analytics as a data source it can pull from."", '', 'For blogging, the data of relevance included', '', 'We wanted our dashboard to give a summary for a specific content over a specific time period. So I added a Landing Page startsWith filter and a Date filter. By using a filter control filter, you can have the Landing Page control provide data driven options and search, making it easy to discover the options without leaving the tool.', '', 'Once you have a dashboard with controls, you will notice that as you configure the controls, the URL changes to include a params paramater. For instance, after seleting a landing page filter and some dates, our dasboard URL query parameter became:', 'The % character suggests that this is a URL encoded string, and after decoding it (e.g. with dencoder), it turns out to be a JSON payload', 'I believe df4 and df5 keys are shorthand for ""data filter 4"" and ""data filter 5"". The values are still further encoded. %EE%80%80 is a three byte UTF-8 character: U+E000, which seems to be used as a field separator. Another round of URL decoding on df5\'s value yields', 'So now it\'s clear ""20200526"" refers to the dates picked. And decoding df4 yields', 'which is clearly the landing page filter control value.', 'Now we understand how the params query parameter is encoded we can generate a URL that takes us to the dashboard, for a specific blog post, showing the data for the 7 days after it was published, just by manipulating the URL.', 'Here is what an active content thread looks like in Slack. I really like the way passing around URLs between applications can unlock a powerful and informative workflow for very little effort. This is why it is important to find tools that understand URLs properly, they compose better.', '', ""The cost for hosting the application is extremely low. We do not publish a lot of Tweets or blogs so we could fit into Zapier's free plan. The Camunda binary is only spun up on demand using Cloud Run, and costs less than $0.01 a day to run. The biggest cost was the Cloud SQL database, but again, as the application was not particularly latency sensitive we could use the smallest db-f1-micro instance size at $9 per month. We also had to pay some storage costs but these were small. All-in-all, it costs less than $10 per month, (excluding Slack user subscriptions), which is truly remarkable value for such a general purpose and reliable system."", 'I definitely think glueing products together is the most cost effective method of creating value. It has helped us get more value out of our content production efforts, and more value out of the tools we already used. While many 3rd products have APIs, there is usually a high barrier to entry to using them effectively.', ""Camunda lowers the cost of automation significantly, by offering a solid runtime and workflow abstraction. Notable features are that it can be self-hosted in an isolated system at low cost. It has excellent monitoring tools, so a ton of work is taken care of out of the box. It's clearly been put together with reliability in mind, the fact it walks through processes via database transitions is top notch and makes long running processes trivial to implement."", ""Zapier complemented the setup well. It saved integrating directly with Twitter and running poll loops. Again, there is a ton of work we didn't have to do and it massively simplified the operations. When you use a solution like Camunda it becomes easier to integrate and get the most out of what is already out there."", 'The main source of frustration was programming mistakes caused by the dynamic scripting language. One bug was a numeric 7 got deserialized as the string ""7"", which ended up iterating much further than expected and was hard to track down. Weird stuff like that doesn\'t usually happen with static languages. This annoyance is magnified due to the difficulty of testing.', ""To run a workflow you need to upload it to an engine. I did not invest much in testing, but I think for consequential applications you would need to invest heavily in running local integration tests. There is no way this can ever be done fast, as temporal events are implemented via DB polling. That said, the engine's REST API is powerful, and pretty much everything can be automated, so I think a reasonable workflow is achievable, but something than requires dedicated resources to acheive."", ""When I look at the whole application as implemented, I would estimate that it's only about 50 lines of non-trivial code! The bulkiest parts were resolving and extracting the URI path from within Twitter API responses, and generating Data Studio URLs. Really it's astounding to me how little code is required to create high quality visualizations and UX workflows when you lean on 3rd party product APIs."", 'Technically, the bulk of the code is really in marshalling and unmarshalling API calls. I used a code generator for this, which saved a ton of tedious development iterations. This was also very useful for having the API descriptions within the Camunda tool, enabling in-tool discovery of functionality.', 'I wish a few other things could be typed. In particular, signals, messages and start/end events should probably have schemas too. They behave very similar to external REST calls and would benefit from code generated templates too.', 'Overall, the greatest thing about BPMN is that the process definition artifacts are both an amazing communication representation and an executable representation. The BPMN diagram view abstracts and explains the general idea at a block diagram level, yet when you click on the boxes, you expand to see the low level details. Furthermore, you can flip to the textual XML representation and manipulate in a code editor, then flip right back again to the graphical representation. The fluidity between graphical and textual is magnificent. The existence of graphical view leads to easy to write documentation. You can clearly see this was the purpose, as the BPMN has special labeling boxes to help guide understanding right within the diagram!', 'In summary, Camunda is a fantastic technology! Why not check it out yourself!']","[""The organization would like employees to write blogs but it's not mandatory."", 'Company culture values impact, feedback and data driven reasoning.', 'Access to the Google Analytics data is protected, so there is a barrier for content authors to see how well a blog does, and anyway, that tool is complicated.', 'Everybody in the organization uses Slack.', 'The organization uses G Suite for identity.', 'Zapier to poll our RSS blog feed', 'Camunda BPMN to orchestrate', 'Google Data Studio to summarize and expose Google Analytics Data', 'Slack to communicate with employees', 'Google Secret Manager to hold the secrets', 'The process starts when a blog writer submits an article to our CMS (Contentful).

https://futurice.com/blog/terraform-recipe-wordpress-fargate,Terraform Recipe for WordPress on Fargate,29 Jul 2020,Technology,Terraform recipe to create a WordPress site on top of Fargate,"['Design Considerations:', 'Cost:']","['WordPress is arguably the most popular content management system available today. It is a popular choice for a wide range of websites, ranging from small personal blogs to large high traffic websites. As per a report, it has a market share of more than 37%. Looking at the recent trends, this number is only going to increase in the days to come.', 'In this blog, I will share with you how to deploy a highly scalable WordPress website using AWS Fargate and Terraform. AWS already has a reference architecture for deploying WordPress on AWS which proposes to use EC2 and Aurora. However, since AWS launched EFS integration with Fargate, I wanted to design a solution using Fargate so that I do not have to configure and manage EC2 instances. Hence, in this solution, Fargate is used for computing and Aurora Serverless for the database. Additionally, I wanted to prepare a Terraform recipe for this (my favourite IaC tool) so I can bring up this architecture very quickly in any AWS account.', '', 'Some of the key design choices made in this approach were selecting Fargate over EC2 and Aurora Serverless over Provisioned Aurora.', 'Fargate is the serverless compute engine for containers provided by AWS. Being a serverless platform, developers are not responsible for building and maintaining host servers and scaling them. All they have to do is build their Docker image and push the image to a Docker image repository like Docker Hub or AWS ECR. AWS takes care of running and managing the underlying host servers. Scaling in Fargate is achieved using Application Auto Scaling and the actual tasks are scaled based on CPU utilization. If the CPU rises above a certain threshold, then new tasks are created which are attached to a target group. Similarly, if the CPU utilization falls below a certain threshold, existing tasks are killed and removed from the target group. ALB (Application Load Balancer) automatically distributes traffic to these targets.', 'Fargate tasks are designed to be stateless in nature. However, WordPress applications need to maintain certain assets in filesystem e.g. plugins and media contents. To store and share the assets among the Fargate tasks, we use EFS (Elastic File System). EFS are AWS managed petabyte-scale NFS (Network File System) which can grow and shrink automatically.', 'Aurora Serverless is the serverless version of Aurora, where scaling and failover are not developer responsibilities and are managed by AWS. All the developer has to do is just mention the min and max capacity. If desired, AWS would shut down the database when not in use for a specific duration. This can be very handy for websites which have very low traffic. Obviously, on the downside, there is a cold start when the database is starting from a complete shutdown and the same during up-scaling. Aurora Serverless is ideal for databases with variable and unpredictable workloads. A provisioned Aurora cluster would make more sense for a very predictable workload. However, in this solution, I wanted to experiment with only serverless solutions.', 'Given that most of the key components used in the architecture i.e. Cloudfront, Application Load Balancer, Fargate, Aurora Serverless and EFS are serverless in nature, the pricing is completely dependent on the usage. However, I have attempted below to estimate the total cost of the solution described above. I have used eu-west-1 (Ireland) region for the estimation.', 'Cloudfront pricing is mostly dependent on the amount of data transfer and the total number of HTTP/HTTPS requests. For a small site with around 100 GB of outbound data transfer and average object size of 30KB, the CloudFront cost will be less than 15 USD per month.', 'ALB has a fixed cost of 18.4 USD per month. On top of that, the pricing is determined based on the LCU (Load Balancer Capacity Units) which is a factor of new connections, active connections, bytes processed and listener rules evaluated. For a small to medium size website, the total ALB cost will be around 25 USD per month.', 'Fargate cost is dependent on the total vCPU and memory used. Taking into account 2 Fargate tasks, each with 1 vCPU and 2 GB of memory, running for 24 hrs a day, the total cost for 30 days is approximately 71 USD.', 'Aurora Serverless cost is dependent on the total ACUs (Aurora Computing Units) consumed, storage and number of I/O requests. The cost is calculated considering that there is peak traffic on the database for 2 hours per day where the database scales to 4 ACUs and there is no traffic on the site for 4 hours during the day where the database shuts down. For the remaining part of the day, the site has minimal traffic and consumes just 2 ACUs. In this scenario, the total cost of usage would be around 3.08 USD per day or 92.4 USD per 30 days. 20 GB of storage would cost 2.2 USD (0.11 * 20) per month and considering 1 million I/O requests per days would cost 6.6 USD (0.22 * 30) per month. This brings the total cost of Aurora Serverless database to be slightly over 100 USD per month.', 'EFS which is used to store assets for the site has a very minimal cost of around 3.3 USD per month taking into account 10 GB of standard storage user per month.', 'Apart from that, there would be additional cost towards NAT Gateways. Cost of a NAT Gateway in eu.west-1 region is 0.048 USD per hour which is 34.56 USD for 30 days. Since, the solution is designed to be highly available and have a NAT Gateway per Availability Zone, it would cost 103.68 USD per month towards fixed cost. Apart from this fixed cost, there is a cost for data processing which is 0.048 per GB.', 'Hence, the total cost of a very light to medium used WordPress site should be around 325 USD per month. Please note that the aforementioned costs are rough estimates and based on certain assumptions. Also to be noted is that the above cost does not take into consideration AWS Data Transfer cost which are ambiguous, super difficult to calculate and would need a huge blog in itself to explain. Given that the solution is serverless and has been designed to scale, the total cost has very less fixed cost and is greatly dependent on the actual usage.', 'The complete source code including the steps to create the infra setup is open-sourced on Futurice‚Äôs Terraform example repository under an MIT license. I hope that this configuration will save you a lot of time setting up your own self hosted WordPress installation.', 'EDIT: Added cost for NAT Gateways']",[]

Organizations and societies that are able to do this thrive in times of uncertainty. If there‚Äôs one thing 2020 and Covid-19 have taught us, it‚Äôs the importance of resilience.', 'The energy sector has plenty of potential to help build more resilient societies around the world. More efficient grid works and smarter grid technologies are a key element in the transformation of the energy sector. To accomplish this, we have to foster collaboration between grid operators, producers, consumers, and stakeholders from the public sector that are commissioning works.', 'Increasing demand for and reliance on electricity, as well as the volatility of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, bring with them growing demands for greater flexibility. Industrial users are investing in their own energy production and storage capabilities. Private customers with small solar panel installations are at times producing more energy than they can use. Mobility is becoming more electrified. The switch to renewable sources will introduce a greater need for ways to balance demand and supply.', 'How, then, should the energy industry cope with the combination of growing demand and increased complexity? With data, better data-informed decision-making, and transparency.', 'IoT and asset-tracking devices, inspection drones, and other technologies produce a lot of data. Sharing that data with all relevant stakeholders and empowering them to find the correct answers to the right questions will make energy production, storage, and distribution more resilient, flexible, and sustainable. Shared data can be used for simulations that determine ahead of time where energy will be needed and what bottlenecks exist for delivery, for example, in local grids. It can help the energy industry and public administrations make informed decisions about distribution as well as continuous improvement of the energy infrastructure. The investments planned in grid infrastructure over the coming decade are 50 billion euros in Germany alone.', 'The smarter and more flexible maintenance and development of energy infrastructure is a particularly important ‚Äì and complex ‚Äì area. We have tackled it and are continuing to work on it together with our client Schleswig-Holstein Netz AG (SHNG), a grid provider from Northern Germany and part of E.ON SE.', 'Maintaining and developing grids involves many factors, like authorisation processes, and the availability of staff, spare parts and components. Easy communication and coordination are vital.', 'The overarching vision is to provide all stakeholders in the building, maintenance, and development of electricity grids with a view on planning, governance, and operation of the grids to make work on grids more efficient and coordinated. This level of transparency would, among other positive impacts, allow for more flexible prioritization in commissioning works by the authorities, and greater awareness among contractors of what works are in the backlog or about to be commissioned, improving the management of all the factors related to grid work.', 'The approach we are taking is to include all stakeholders and strive to address their needs as well as empower them to collaborate with each other. The SHNG Smart Extranet we are co-creating with our client includes, for example, all key authorities as well as adjacent ones such as traffic and building, and companies involved in e.g. telecommunications and water supply.', 'Where people working in the field were once reliant on over a dozen different digital tools, we have worked to centralize many of the processes into a single tool. We are also working on reducing the amount of effort and time people in the field need to spend on administrative tasks.', 'Our work is still in its early stages and we don‚Äôt yet have enough data points to, for example, run complex simulations. In some parts of the grid, we can‚Äôt yet tell how much energy was delivered to which node and which sources the energy was coming from. The increasing number of smart meters will fix these shortcomings and provide better insight into the grid. In general, assets in energy grids are getting more and more digital and will produce a lot of new data in the near future. When used correctly, this data can be used to improve not only the energy supply and balance on the grid, but the supply and service the energy sector provides to other industries, like healthcare, public and private mobility, manufacturing and many more.', 'A culture of sharing data and collaboration between different stakeholders in this area is still a new practice and there‚Äôs lots of room for improvement.

https://futurice.com/blog/interview-with-mobility-expert-katharina-wagner,Interview with Mobility Expert Katharina Wagner,21 Jul 2020,Opinion,"Authorities and operators should collaborate on smart mobility solutions, to make it as easy as possible for residents to choose alternative mobility options to the private car.",[],"['Katharina Wagner is a passionate domain expert, panelist and speaker with extensive experience in shared mobility. As co-founder of the innovative zone-based car sharing concept Oply, she shares her experiences and observations of trends and developments in the sharing economy.', 'Looking at ongoing changes in the mobility landscape, what are the biggest trends that you are observing?', 'Looking at the more general trends, there are various developments which have been driving mobility for several years now: CASE (or ACES) has been the ‚Äúbattle cry‚Äù of various OEM CEOs and mobility experts for years now. It stands for connected, autonomous, shared and electric. Of course those are the trends which have been and will be driving mobility models, modes and behaviour. Within those trends we have seen new mobility services emerge such as ride-hailing, micromobility, new sharing and (short-term) leasing offers, just to name a few. There is also a trend towards integration and connection of the different mobility modes within bigger systems through cooperation or even private or public apps, which should create a seamless customer journey and make all modes easily accessible through one app (although there are no examples at the moment with 100% of mobility options integrated in one app, there does exist various cross-industry cooperation in that area). Looking a bit beyond terrestrial mobility, I am a big fan of VTOL (vertical landing and takeoff aircrafts) which are designed to cover all aspects of CASE and will have a revolutionary impact on the way we will move in future.', 'With the current situation of Covid-19 we have also seen major changes in the mobility behaviour. During the lockdown mobility around the world stood still, resulting in reduction of rides in all mobility modes, with extreme drops of up to 90% in public transportation, shared mobility, micro mobility etc. So the ‚Äúshared‚Äù part in CASE has suffered the most due to Corona. On the other hand, we have seen a tremendous demand increase for individual (non-shared) mobility options, such as private car, short-term leasing options and also biking and walking. The operating model of especially short term sharing offers such as free float car sharing, scooter or ride sharing, resulted in trust issues as customers could not evaluate when and if the car was rented, if the car has been disinfected, or who might be joining the ride through ride sharing (here even the driver was a problematic factor). This forced all short term car sharing companies to pivot to longer term rentals to serve the customer demand for individual, non shared, and thus ‚Äúsecure‚Äù mobility. Also the pre-Covid-19 hyped mobility stations and apps were completely obsolete during the pandemic as people preferred to stick to one mode of mobility in order to reduce risk of infection.', 'At the same time, and for the first time in almost eight years that I have been working in mobility, we have seen cities taking very bold steps in changing their infrastructure to give more space to bike and pedestrian traffic. Many of those changes have been claimed to be impossible by city authorities before the pandemic, which has then transformed our urban areas to something we have been striving to achieve for so many years: Cities have become more livable - with more space for the people and less for the traffic. The major shift to home office working has tremendously contributed to that as well.', 'What is your view on the shifting mobility needs consumers have?', ""We're in a transition phase at the moment. It's still to be seen how the behaviour of consumers, companies and governments will evolve after the pandemic. I am positive that various cities will keep at least parts of the changes permanently. Also, around 50% of German companies claimed to enable their staff to work from home office after corona, at least sometimes. This should lead to a lower mobility need in general, resulting in lower traffic, congestion, parking search and pollution. With time, public transportation will definitely gain in importance again as the major mobility mode for millions of people around Europe."", 'At the same time the private car should decrease in importance after Corona. There are some indicators which support this assumption: we have not seen private car purchases explode, on the contrary, people buy less cars at the moment, but what does explode is the number of flexible leasing options for individual cars with companies such as Cluno or (newly established) Sixt+. It shows that people prefer to enter short term commitments for car ownership, which can also be easily resolved when not needed anymore. I expect this to be the case after the pandemic.', 'During the last years you have been working in the field of Shared Mobility. What were the specific challenges and opportunities you experienced?', 'Running a car sharing operations can be very demanding. I have been able to learn in both areas ‚Äì free float and zone or station based car sharing and there are some common and some different challenges and opportunities in those operational models.', 'Let‚Äôs start with the common ones: Both have the potential to be a piece of the multi-modality puzzle in order to make the individual vehicle obsolete. This has been a driving factor for me when working in shared mobility: contributing to make our cities more livable. Both do change the way how people move and therefore have a huge impact on their lives. Shared mobility also has a social aspect, giving access to vehicles to people who did not have that option before. \nThere are mainly two challenges in both systems which I‚Äôd like to mention: First, the access to city parking - it can be a very long, frustrating and not plannable process to negotiate parking solutions with each individual city. And second, a very streamlined operation - as there are various operational pitfalls which can easily make it impossible to turn any profits.', 'Looking at the different operational modes, free floating is essentially based on big numbers. To make the service attractive one needs to cover a considerably big operating area, provide a big number of vehicles to make those fast and easily accessible to the consumers and attract enough riders per day to reach a reasonable vehicle utilization as the average trip is rather short. This results in rather high capital requirements to run this kind of operation. \nOn the opportunity side, free floating companies can benefit from economies of scale much faster. They also provide a lot more customer insights and learnings of running a professional fleet, helping to improve operational excellence. We have seen free floating car sharing to be a rather strategic investment (often of OEMs or rental companies) that see the need to reinvent themselves before somebody else reinvents and disrupts their markets. And although various locations do turn profits, the investors did (and still do) need a lot of persistence and focus on the strategic aspect before full operational break-even can be reached.', 'A station or zone based car sharing model can be run profitably with much lower size in fleet, customers, cities, and investment. It allows for growth with customer demand, very targeted marketing activities, and requires lower fleet sizes as cars don‚Äôt need to cover big home areas etc. The opportunity here is really to replace the private car for the community around the station / zone and become the mobility mode of choice in situations when an individual vehicle is needed. Growth and numbers are slower, but the impact in reducing private car ownership can be much higher compared to free float.', 'Which opportunities do you see for the Car Sharing sector in the future? ', 'Shared Mobility is here to stay. Various developments and trends will push it to become an integral part of our lives, at least in urban areas. And both sharing modes ‚Äì free float and station based ‚Äì are just two choices in a mobility mix which has to exist in a city to make the private car obsolete. They can not only coexist, they actually complement one another perfectly, depending on the type of trip the customer is planning. As part of the mobility mix of a city, car sharing can contribute to reducing congestion, parking pressure, emissions and traffic jams.', 'There will also be an impact on the automotive industry through car sharing. The car sharing market size is predicted to be a multi-billion business by various research institutes and eventually this business model will have an impact on OEMs, that will build and sell more shared and sharing-ready vehicles over time and less individually owned ones.', 'But I think we will see even more consolidation in the industry driven by lower demand through Corona, intense price competition and the very high capital needs of this business model. Hopefully at the end of this phase, financially sustainable sharing companies will be formed and capable of staying permanently. This is an important factor, as people will only change their mobility behaviour, or maybe even sell privately owned cars, if they are able to rely on the mobility options to be present permanently.', 'How can city authorities help to make Car Sharing more successful? ', 'City authorities play an important role for the car sharing operators‚Äô success. They are the ‚Äúgates‚Äù to the city parking and should establish clear and fair regulations which define under what conditions a car sharing company can offer its services within the city. This is essential for business planning, but also to be able to offer a sustainable and reliable service to the consumers. There are some great examples of cities in Europe, which have clear regulations for car sharing. However, and sadly, that is the case in only a handful of locations. We need a clear sign from city authorities that they are pro car sharing and are willing to support it with actions - not only words.', 'What else do you think cities need to do to become smarter in terms of mobility?', 'Car sharing is just one mobility mode of the modal mix of a city. Authorities, together with the operators, should work on smart solutions in order to make it as transparent and easy as possible for the residents to choose alternative mobility options to the private car. This can include mobility stations like e.g. in Hamburg, or even mobility flat rates as provided in Augsburg. There is no ‚Äúsecret sauce‚Äù as every city and every mobility mix is truly unique. So the key is cooperation and a true give and take of both, authorities and mobility providers.', 'Looking a bit beyond mobility modes, there are great technologies out there which will be part of a smart city and improve mobility in general. Connected vehicles (we had that aspect in CASE) which communicate with one another and with street infrastructure could have a huge impact in improving congestion, finding parking spaces and much more. Possibilities are endless. I think it is crucial for the city authorities to have a holistic view on mobility, create a clear strategy and execute on it relentlessly, independent of elections or even changes in political direction of city governments. This can also help authorities to work with limited budgets as it will make it easier to motivate private companies to undertake long term (infrastructure) investments in a certain city.', 'And last but definitely not least, city authorities have to think outside of the box. In so many discussions with city governments I hit a wall because ‚Äúthere is no law‚Äù regulating this or that aspect of my business proposition. It is the nature of technologies and new business models, that our current laws and legislations have no clear answers on how to handle those. But I have seen great leadership examples of individuals within city authorities, who found creative ways to still make it possible, even though the laws for that specific purpose have not been written yet. We need that kind of pioneering spirit within city authorities to bring more innovation to our roads.', 'Which roles do you think partnerships play in smart mobility ecosystems? ', 'The more information and experience is bundled, the smarter a mobility ecosystem can become. Therefore partnerships are essential for the development of smart mobility ecosystems. In my experience startup companies are much more open to partnerships and cooperation and I have seen great support within the startup community in Berlin. And also within the old economy - while silo thinking was more present in the past - we are starting to see more cooperation with even the biggest rivals; e.g. BMW and Daimler establishing a JV for mobility business models, or R&D cooperation for autonomous vehicles. That is a very good development on the way to smarter and more successful mobility offers.', 'What technologies do you see as the biggest enablers for the coming years in our changing mobility ecosystem?', 'I would like to emphasize the two technological trends that will bring mobility to the next level: connected cars (and cities) and autonomous driving. There is so much potential which can be raised through those technologies, that I believe, we still cannot evaluate the full impact it will have on our lives. It might be comparable to the invention of the iPhone which launched full tsunamis of new business models and offerings. This is definitely going to happen with connectivity and autonomy as well. But we will still have to wait a bit for it. Definitely more than five to ten years.', 'About Katharina Wagner', '', 'Katharina Wagner is a passionate domain expert, panelist and speaker with over 14 years experience in mobility, digital business models and customer centricity.

My role varies from studying and prototyping with emerging technologies to applying them to client problems in different domains.', 'Our team recently released our views on where we would bet our money on for defining the future. One of the bets we came up with was called ‚ÄúNew eyes in the skies‚Äù. It‚Äôs about how satellite and drone data will create new opportunities for plenty of domains in the near future. After publishing the bets, and having a webinar about drones and satellites, I realized that while I do know a thing or two about satellite data, I do not have any practical experience with it. So what I decided to do was to contact Skywatch, one of the promising startups we mention in the bet.', 'I had no concrete problem to solve, but I had some questions that I‚Äôd like to have an answer for:', 'So I mentioned I contacted a company selling satellite data. Honestly, as a frequent user of many APIs, I was expecting to just create an account, add a credit card and start calling the API. I tried looking at other companies as well, but they all seemed to have this extra step for getting access. As it comes to Skywatch, the process was nice and I got to talk with a few experts about the possibilities of satellite data and also got a nice demo of their browser-based tool. Not the smoothest ride, but got the access pretty easily. And this is not exactly a consumer service, so getting some help and tips immediately might not be a bad thing.', 'After getting the access to the tool, it was time to start going through their API documentation and the browser-based tool which can be used for creating the pipelines. A pipeline in here means a process where you specify your settings, like an area of interest and which kind of images you want, and in the end you get the preprocessed data to be downloaded either via the browser or via the API.', '\nHietalahti beach in Helsinki. 0.5 meters per pixel resolution makes it possible to distinguish even individual persons.', 'Like I stated earlier, Skywatch API works with a concept called Pipelines. Pipeline settings consist roughly of the following: area of interest, output type, date range, interval and resolution. So for example: ‚ÄúFor Tampere area, I want a medium resolution true color image for every week of 2020‚Äù. The date range can include both past and future dates, so it‚Äôs possible to create an ongoing earth observation process. The whole process can be automatized with a webhook that gets called every time the pipeline status changes.', 'In addition to getting images from the archive, there is a feature that took me straight back to being 10 yo and watching the supervillain command the satellite weapon called Golden Eye in the similarly named James Bond movie. Just type the coordinates and wait for the orbit to align. This is actually something you can do via the Skywatch API. Well, apart from having a weapon or seeing the orbit align in real time. It doesn‚Äôt even cost millions, but as little as 300 USD. I didn‚Äôt yet figure out an exciting enough idea to try that, but might as well for a good cause.', '\nIn addition to sticking with visible light, there are options for using other optical bands or processed images.', 'An important thing I learnt while playing with the pipelines was that high resolution satellite data is not an endless resource. I‚Äôve seen the marketing materials of many companies stating something like ‚Äúthe whole globe twice a day‚Äù. Still at least here in latitudes over 60, it looks like the game is more about using the data you find rather than having exact date requirements for the images. Experts from Skywatch told that it‚Äôs because the high resolution satellites do not have continuous shooting mode, but they only take photos when tasked to do so. Like when the supervillains have tasked a capture for a certain region and date, also everyone else can access the data afterwards.', 'The above is true for high resolution images. It‚Äôs better to think the high resolution availability so that if you have a long period of time, there might be some high resolution data available. But definitely not for any date and location. After exploring the platform, I‚Äôd say that generally the high resolution data is not available unless you get lucky.  For medium and low resolutions, the availability of data is generally much better.', 'There are also some other variables in the equation of availability. If you want to observe a certain area at a certain time, it may just be that the weather is cloudy. For that, there is a parameter for area of interest. The default value is 90%, so there might be a 10% area covered with clouds. Also what I noticed was that because the time interval for the photos is a minumum of one day, you cannot request a photo from a certain time of day. So it might be that some of your images are taken in the morning and some in the afternoon. So the direction and lenght of shadows and how light or dark the photos are may vary.', '\nFlooding in northern Finland found on satellite images after running into this article. 3 meters per pixel', 'The resolution names work as shortcuts on the UI of the platform, but in reality those are predefined resolution ranges. Low resolution is anything between 10 and 30 meters per pixel, medium is from 2 to 4.5 meters and high is down to 0.3 meters per pixel. When creating the pipelines using the API, one has to define the range of acceptable resolutions and the priority for choosing a single photo from multiple matching the criteria. You can prioritize either the resolution or the accurate date more.', 'So what exactly does low or high resolution mean? On the image below, you can see the same area with three different resolutions. On the low resolution image, big features like roads, fields and forests are easily seen. Using more than one image will also make it possible to detect changes in features, which might not be obvious to human eye when looking at a single frame. On the medium resolution image, more features are visible and it‚Äôs possible to detect for example individual trees on open areas and pathways going across the forest. Finally on the high resolution image, individual cars can be seen racing through the track and trees can be distinguished from each other even in the forest. The high resolution photo is with 0.8 meters per pixel resolution, but it‚Äôs possible to get even higher resolution images. Up to 0.3 meters per pixel resolutions are available and going under 0.5 meters resolution, even individual persons can be detected.', '\nIconic racetrack N√ºrburgring Nordschleife and the famous Carousel in 10, 3 and 0.8 meter resolutions.', ""While launching cameras into space is still quite an expensive journey, buying the satellite data doesn't put any accidental dents in your credit card. On the Skywatch platform, the low resolution data is free! Admittedly, at least some of it is open data and is available also elsewhere, but not necessarily in such an easy format. The higher resolutions come with a price, but those are quite reasonable also. The medium resolution cost is 2,50 USD/km¬≤ and high resolution 10 USD/km¬≤ if found from the archive. If you need to order the satellite to get the high resolution photos, it costs 12 USD/km¬≤ but has a 25km¬≤ minimum area. These prices are for my current plan and there is another plan with even cheaper prices, but it comes with minumum billing of 1000 USD."", ""The total price of operating with satellite data comes from your required intervals and resolutions. For example if you need a weekly image of 10 km¬≤ area in medium resolution, the price will be close to 1500 USD a year. Going for a daily high resolution image for the same area will end up in 40 000 USD. Real prices will include only the images that meet your criteria, so if there are intervals that don't have data for you, you won't pay for it either."", 'Having this huge new source of data might be intimidating. Going through the images manually would be a really laborious process. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs really important that the platform supports fully automatic processing. Photo orders, pipelines, can be done automatically via the API and the photos can be received programmatically after they are available. This allows building autonomous processes that are observing our home planet constantly.', 'To this date, the computer vision systems have been developing so fast that detecting features or classifying images has become really feasible. Combining computer vision with the amount of data available will make the observing much more efficient than any human could do. Whether it‚Äôs a ship, car or a damaged forest area you‚Äôre looking for, if it‚Äôs possible to detect with human eye, a computer will most probably detect it as well.', '\nDevelopment of Tampere area from 2017 to 2020 visualized with image difference. 10 m per pixel resolution.', 'Satellite data is something that can already be used in a wide variety of tasks. It‚Äôs really nicely available and affordable. Combined with computer vision and domain knowledge, there are endless possibilities to turn that data into new business opportunities. Frequent high resolution satellite observation might not be the most valid use case yet due to the price and availability of the data, but experimenting with satellite data in less demanding tasks is definitely worthwhile. The most important thing to note is that the technology and platforms are already here and ready to be built into fully automated continuous processes.', ""If you have any questions or would like to start experimenting with satellite data to find new opportunities, do contact us and let's go high above!"", 'For more information about how we see drone and satellite data shaping the world, visit ‚ÄúNew eyes in the skies‚Äù']","['How much does satellite data actually cost?', 'Can I get satellite data easily via an API?', 'How good is satellite data for analysis?']"

As part of strengthening our resilience, we reached out to open-minded and courageous leaders from our networks and co-created ideas to tackle the challenges we all have faced.', 'The last few months have made the importance of knowing what‚Äôs relevant, having a clear vision, agile mindset, and trusting relationships clear. Without them, we won‚Äôt be able to move forward in a volatile and uncertain environment. Revising our strategies, improving our end-to-end transparency, and having constructive discussions around them has helped many survive and sometimes even thrive in these abnormal times. We needed the psychological safety we have been building in the past and fast iterations to find the best ways to go forward.', 'In other words, we have used our resilience to tackle our common, new future.', 'Tip #1: Connect the collective. \nReach out and find ways to create new connections to gain new input into your thinking. As a leader, encourage and enable people around you to do so, too. One way we employed was to set up co-ideation sessions with leaders from different industries and countries. Having a diversity of thought available is important.', 'On how we see resilience\nA strong and resilient leader builds capabilities on many levels: personal, team, organisational, and societal. A strong and resilient leader listens with an open and curious mindset to truly understand what‚Äôs going around them and is able to adapt to the required changes. Such a leader is like a reed that dances in the wind - able to bend, but never broken; not unreachable by troubles and challenges, but able to recover and bounce forward. A resilient leader takes great care of their own personal resilience, practices, reflects, and repeats and exercises compassion towards others as well as themselves. This way the resilient leader is able to inspire with a clear vision and encourage the team to go towards it together.', 'On insights from the session\nThe diverse set of leaders who joined the co-ideation sessions from all over Europe, different industries, and from various stages in their careers were clearly facing similar challenges, especially when it came to organisational culture. This is an important topic for leaders no matter their position. Getting people together to share their thinking was of great value - as one of the participants from retail described:', '""I found it very interesting. Not only the topic itself but also the fact that people with similar approaches were connected together to exchange ideas.""', 'When people described the challenges they faced, it was often around the fixed mindsets over what has worked before and organisational structures that were clashing with the new needs of collaboration and co-creation over silos. Finding different ways to bring a stronger focus to creating more value for clients and keeping the feedback loops short in a volatile environment was seen as a key opportunity area. The emergent strategy approach helps to make sense of events around us and use them to create new opportunities instead of staying with the old, obsolete targets. In almost every thread we shared in the session, the connection between an organisation‚Äôs culture, business development activities, and ways of working were truly interconnected. It takes a holistic approach to build resilience in an organisation.', 'The most humbling thing for us was how clear the importance of the human side in these discussions is. We talked a lot about personal resilience levels, its challenges and ways to strengthen it with mindfulness, joint activities in the given circumstances, or by building trust and openly talking about fears the situation brought out in people. The closer to the human side we got, the more the challenges and solutions started resembling each other became across domains, countries, and different organisational cultures.', 'Building business resilience offers many opportunities to innovate and borrow ideas from other domains.', 'Having highly meaningful discussions builds trust and deeper connections within our networks. It also gave us all new ideas to try out - as one participant from the health sector put it:', ""‚ÄúI got some new thoughts about resilience that I will foster in my working environment. They include e.g. practicing resilient leadership now, when there is so much uncertainty in our environment. There's no better time for it!‚Äù"", 'Sometimes it‚Äôs highlighting some eternal wisdom, at other times seeking novel ideas to try out. The most important thing is to take concrete steps together with those who walk with us.', 'Tip #2: Connect to what really happens around you. \nFind mindfulness practices that feel natural and are right for your organisation. It can be, for example, a silent minute before a meeting to get everyone‚Äôs focus on what‚Äôs important in the topic of the meeting.', 'On our approach on how to strengthen resilience\nBuilding on top of the already existing culture and fostering its strengths creates authentic cultural progress. Every challenge we face is an opportunity to test its limits and strengthen it. It‚Äôs an ongoing effort and when we accept the constant change and build our ways of working around continuous improvement, it‚Äôs easier for us to let go of what‚Äôs no longer relevant and keep our focus on what is. This is really a big thing to accomplish and shouldn‚Äôt be done in silos or solitude. Connecting with others, especially at critical times can deepen connections and teach everyone important lessons. Someday, it can save our lives.', 'Tip #3: Reflect. \nHave regular retrospectives on all parts and levels of the organisation to boost organisational agility.

However, it‚Äôs far beyond simply recovering from crises or taking actions to better weather the next storm. Focusing on a resilient future means to proactively prepare for change. This enables companies to shape their future and remain relevant in an ever faster changing world.', 'You mentioned the term resilient future. What is the difference to resilience as it‚Äôs commonly understood?', 'What is new and far-reaching here is the introduction of resilience as criteria for securing and shaping the future. For us, it‚Äôs not only about bouncing back from adversity, but also bouncing forward. If you want to strengthen the future viability of your company, you have to increase the resilience of the entire organization. Looking behind the soft factor, resilience entails learnable and measurable practices that leaders can actively promote in their organizations. This begins with the insight that the future cannot be planned but shaped, which means that we must not only allow but actively promote change.', 'What can companies do to build their resilient future?', 'When we support clients on their journey to a resilient future, there is of course no one size fits it all solution. However, we discovered five principles to be highly effective:', '1. Reframe Reality', 'Neither a pure internal, nor an external view is sufficient to develop a company in the right direction. What works better is to take up weak and informal internal signals and systematically reinforce them from the outside. You need to check if your internal assumptions about the world can survive in the face of reality.', 'For example, the innovative strength of a leading commercial vehicle manufacturer in Europe was sustainably increased through a development program that focused on the co-creation of content from the very start. Ideas that were favored internally at first but did not address customer needs were discarded through the cooperation of internal experts and external coaches, later being replaced by ideas with real market potential. Employees were thus allowed to draw their own conclusion instead of having it dictated. When solutions like this are grounded in the corporate culture, you can leverage the potential of your organization and engage employees, which will lead to better results overall.', '2. Connect the Collective', 'Many larger companies miss alignment between individual decision-makers and/or departments. Although they want to drive changes forward, there is no agreement or no one wants to make a decision. What‚Äôs often missing is a whole-system perspective that helps everybody to support the greater goals of the organisation.', 'In our work, we often see that project owners separate themselves too much from others in similar roles, focusing solely on the success of their own project. While this hyper-focus helps them to get results, it can easily lead to a fragmented landscape. This can be countered by placing the individual projects in a more systemic context through programs that aim for joint value creation. Each project then makes its contribution to the shared goal, creating a common interest in the overall success instead of pursuing particular interests. As a side effect, the implementation capacity of the department increases.', '3. Expand Expectations', 'Adapting to change is not only about new tools or copying best practices. You have to actively stimulate and support curiosity within the organization. Encourage employees to new and unfamiliar ways of thinking and working, and ask your managers to lead by example. For example, you can run an Opportunity Workshop to explicitly ask the team for emerging options in the market. Bringing in new and uncommon impulses from artists, scientists, or unconventional thinkers might invite discussion and encourage employees to join in. We often see how great ideas emerge when domain experts are confronted with external inspiration.', 'However, a lack of guidance results in random experimentation, where everyone follows individual objectives and resources are spread too thin for promising experiments to succeed. So look at what innovation experiments can be done and select carefully. Aim for a healthy mix of iteration and leapfrog innovation.', 'Lastly, and this is one of my all-time favorites: You need to kill your darlings! In many projects the level of scrutiny when it comes to testing ideas, e.g. in the form of a prototype, is not good enough. As creators and developers of new services and business models, we become very fond of our own ideas. By applying what I call Kill your Darling Testing, we can overcome this strong confirmation bias.', '4. Bring value to all', 'Value creation is about more than generating success for shareholders and management, and it should never be about serving internal politics. The goal is to involve the entire system, so think about value for employees, partners, your community and society at large ‚Äì especially in the long term.', 'For instance, we can make it a goal that everybody working for and with us ends up a little bit better prepared for the future. We can invest in our employees‚Äô development to an extent that goes beyond what is necessary to do their current job. As a consequence, unforeseen crises can be better dealt with, the employee becomes more valuable for the job market and partners and clients can benefit from a better transfer of know-how.', 'It makes sense to consider multiple kinds of value creation beyond the economical. As a business, you  have the power to create value related to regional development, social cohesion, tolerance, equality and fairness. Using it not only makes you a force of good, it also improves your resilience as it creates trust. Others will be more inclined to help you when they see you contributing to what‚Äôs important to them.', '5. Build change capacity', 'The whole company - and by this I mean the senior management together with all employees - should prepare for change as well as possible. Change will increasingly become a reality in our professional and personal life. If you want to be able to proactively design the future of your organisation, it is essential to be prepared for it.', ""This means to not only think along the lines of current (business) reality but to make room for future thinking, e.g. through future scenarios. Practice thinking about different possible futures and their consequences, and try them out together. Stay aware of employees' fears and take care of them as best as you can to draw positive energy from hesitations. Finally, think about change as a journey. Identify the smallest meaningful next step you can take and get started. You can call it your Minimum Viable Change. Creating momentum is the most important thing to build better resilience over time."", 'What are typical concerns when employees are faced with change? And what can companies do to solve them?', 'A common fear that comes with change and progress is to not being able to keep up with constantly accelerating technology or being replaced by younger employees or automation and AI. It is important to recognize the underlying fear patterns early and to fully address them to actively reduce the worrying.', 'It helps to openly speak about what makes people valuable to the company and also to invest in their future. Strengthen their self-confidence in their effectiveness, but also draw attention to gaps and challenges. Work together to stay relevant, and create a future for your company that is meaningful for everyone. You will be surprised what ideas come up when you start asking for them.', 'What actions would you recommend to actively promote change? ', 'Managers have to understand that change is nothing that happens to us. We do not have to stand by and be passive. Change always happens from and through us. When managers exemplify this attitude and communicate it to their employees, they strengthen the confidence of each individual to successfully master change. My personal learning from change programs over the last years is that management needs to lead the way. They need to visibly change their own behavior in order to inspire change in others.', 'Some practical steps I would recommend to managers:', 'Establish and strengthen relationships beyond departmental boundaries. Show that the value of networking is seen and rewarded in the company. Make examples of cross-border teamwork visible. Implement tools for a whole-system perspective and share it with everybody (not just the management team).\nMake the expertise of employees visible and celebrate beyond positions and roles. At the same time, make the discussion about gaps in know-how a regular, normal thing. Talk about weaknesses to find ways to compensate for them.\nUnderline things that work well and emphasise challenges that have been mastered. Celebrate successes and strengths instead of chalking up failures (using insights from positive psychology).\nTo overcome bottlenecks and barriers that stand in the way of employees taking decisions, ensure a sufficient flow of information, and make data available. Informed employees think along and can develop solutions themselves. This is real empowerment beyond the buzz.\nAsk questions instead of just giving answers. Practice to say: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Develop a curiosity for the concerns and challenges of others and give them room to talk.', 'By demonstrating this sort of leadership, managers can actively promote the ability of their company to master resilience and embrace change as a business capability.']",[]

But an underrated aspect of open source is its utility for learning. If you have access to the insides of a thing ‚Äì in the case of software, the code ‚Äì then you can learn from it, experiment with it and understand how to build something like it. And that‚Äôs true for more products than just software. This blog post looks at one of those other products: open source music. But before we get there, let‚Äôs back up a bit ‚Ä¶', 'In the early days of us, mothers and fathers would teach their children to sing, and perhaps a skilled musician in the village or nomadic community would teach the young of that community to play the flute or drums or lyre. In that way playing, improvising and composing skills, which I imagine were not as separate then as they are now, were passed on and developed from one generation to the next.', 'Some of those nomads and villagers built cities and invented reading and writing. They also realised that they could make their compositions immortal by writing them down in musical notation. The oldest fairly complete composition known, the Hurrian Hymn to Nikkal, was carved into a cuneiform tablet in the Amorite-Canaanite city of Ugarit around 1400 BCE. In monastic Europe, abbots and the abbesses discovered that they could share the best of what Christendom had to offer in this way, and so they set to writing and copying musical manuscripts.', ""It‚Äôs not clear to me when sheet music also became an important tool for learning how to compose, but I think learning is unlikely to have been a driving force in its development. The Wikipedia article for sheet music hardly even mentions its usefulness for learning. The driving forces were probably preserving music for posterity and standardising the Church liturgy. But by the time we get to the 19th century (the printing press having long since been invented), we find countless stories of composers intensely studying the scores of one or another of their heroes. Anton Bruckner, for example, studied ‚ÄúMozart, Beethoven, Cherubini, Schubert, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Liszt, Brahms and Wagner [...] Bruckner's pupil Friedrich Eckstein reports that the composer's apartment near the Schottenring in the Hessgasse was cluttered with ‚Äòmountains of books, scores and music‚Äô piled ‚Äòso high that only a Hercules could move them‚Äô‚Äù1. Recall Stravinsky: ‚ÄúA good composer does not imitate; he steals.‚Äù"", 'Parallel to this, music teaching gradually turned into a real profession. Composers like Sweelinck, Rameau, Rimsky-Korsakov, Hindemith and Sch√∂nberg and many others taught and wrote books and treatises about music theory and composition. In fact, it‚Äôs very difficult to find composers before the 20th century who made ends meet through the sale of compositions. Instead they were monks or nuns, teachers, tutors, directors of music for the monarchy or the nobility, or they supported themselves via patronage, concert income or inheritance.', 'So we see historical composers benefitting from teacher-student relationships, treatises written by major composers and sheet music available for studying. This all changed in the 20th century. The chief reason for the change was recording technology, which allowed music makers to profit from the sales of recordings and reduced demand for live performance and hence also for sheet music. And none of this was a conscious decision ‚Äì all of this happened as if naturally.', 'Put in another way, music used to arrive to listeners via a two-step process: (1) draw up a set of performance instructions (the sheet music), and (2) execute those instructions to create sound. In this way it is similar to architecture and software. Because it was no more conceivable to distribute music as sound then than it was to move a standing building, you had to distribute it as it was in the intermediate step, as instructions.', 'When a producer today makes music, the process may look more like this: (1) draw up a set of instructions (DAW projects, MIDI tracks, samples, synth and effect parameters and so on), (2) export to another set of instructions (an audio file), and (3) execute those instructions to actually produce sound waves. The distributed artefacts are now one step removed from those produced in the creative act. Ones and zeroes are not useful objects of musical study.', 'Instead, what aspiring music makers have today are in the main YouTube tutorials, blog posts and recordings of the music they admire. It‚Äôs a very slow process, sometimes hopeless, of trial and error to figure out how a song or a part of a song was made just from listening to it. It‚Äôs not unlike trying to reverse-engineer a piece of software. How much easier would it be if you had access to the notes (be it as sheet music or as MIDI), the DAW project file, samples used, effect and instrument parameters and so on? In other words, if the music and its instructions had been open-sourced by their maker? But there is not much of that today, so we are left fumbling about in the dark.', 'Sheet music was obsolesced by recordings, the supply of which is no longer limited by the costs of production, but instead has to be restricted via streaming services, digital rights management and crackdowns on illegal file-sharing, in other words artificially. The marginal cost of producing a digital copy of a song is near zero. But the marginal cost of producing a copy of a DAW project file, a sample pack or a software plugin ‚Äì in other words of the ‚Äúinternals‚Äù of digitally created music ‚Äì is also near zero.2 This is exciting and promising. It is also what has made the open source movement possible.', 'Ultimately, every music maker must decide for themselves how much or how little effort to spend on knowledge sharing. Some have no interest in it, and that‚Äôs fine. I suspect many are even a little bit embarrassed of the simple tricks they use to achieve this or that sound. But those who do want to teach and share their knowledge ought to consider releasing their creations, tools and processes under open source licenses.']",[]

They need to get faster and more flexible to adapt to changing situations‚Ä¶",[],"['As Product Strategist and Lead Mentor at MAN Impact Accelerator, Ben Steinmetz is committed to transforming MAN beyond OEM to be ready for a digital and automated future. Focused on innovating business models and customer-oriented solutions to clear the path for an autonomous driving strategy for busses, Ben talks about trends, technologies, data strategies and other opportunities in the field of urban mobility - now and in the future.', 'Looking at the ongoing changes in urban mobility, which trends and misconceptions do you observe?', 'Talking about trends, it‚Äôs seamless mobility, which is the combined consequence of other trends. There‚Äôs sharing-economy, that leads to fewer cars in cities and requires alternative forms of transport. Trends like neo-ecology and holistic-health lead to an increase in walking and biking in the cities, taking modal share splits from all other forms of transport.', 'When we talk about public transport, in particular, it‚Äôs a whole new set of prerequisites. Ever since its existence, public transport has been the mode of transport for people, who were too poor to afford a car. You might say it was a binary system ‚Äì car or bus. For a decade, public transport became the mode of choice for more and more wealthy customers with new needs and other forms of mobility appeared. The binary system changed to a multi-system. Ultimately, public transport needs to adapt to the new circumstances and needs to find its role ‚Äì which is very exciting to observe.', 'The biggest misconception for me is to call it urban mobility. If you want to solve the traffic problems in cities you need to include rural areas. Especially in Germany, we‚Äôre a country of commuters. Also, urban mobility shouldn‚Äôt be a totally free market. To create an urban mobility ecosystem, which improves the individual transport experience and the traffic in cities, we will need holistic planning and solutions. The role model for such a system is Transport for London and the Jelbi App in Berlin.', 'As we look further into the future, there‚Äôs always the picture of small autonomous pods, rolling around green cities. I hope the part with the green cities will happen but I‚Äôm pretty sure, we won‚Äôt roll around in small autonomous pods. Not because of technology, but because of the simple fact, that the infrastructure can‚Äôt handle the necessary amount of vehicles (OECD study). Mass transit will always be part of Urban Mobility.', 'Where do you personally see the biggest opportunities around urban mobility?', 'Business-wise, it‚Äôs the platform to bring together different forms of mobility and combine them to a passenger-centric and flexible offer which is a real alternative to cars for all the people with different needs and wishes. But such a platform consists of different building blocks and I‚Äôm sure not all of these blocks will be handled by one company. You need the data to understand the demand, which can change with a pretty high frequency and other influences on the mobility system. The second block is the intelligence to get the right results out of this data and draw the right conclusion for all the forms of mobility services. Finally, the mobility services itself. These are the main building blocks and opportunities but there are much smaller building blocks, like payment platforms and so on.', 'Which technologies do you see as the most important ones in the future of mobility ecosystems?', 'Although autonomous driving isn‚Äôt coming as fast as most people expected a few years ago, it‚Äôs a game-changer. Its influence on operating costs in transport is unrivaled to any transport technology ever developed. It enables a whole set of new mobility offers with a passenger-friendly price structure. Still, autonomous driving will take years to be ready, we will see highly automated systems in the near future as it can already influence the operating costs structure a lot.', ""Digitalization will be necessary to build an efficient transport offer. The complexity of a sophisticated urban mobility system can't be handled by humans. The amount and frequency of factors influencing the system are simply too high."", 'What role do ecosystems play in urban mobility?', 'It‚Äôs a crucial one. Especially when we talk about a system with different forms of mobility. I‚Äôm pretty sure no company can handle the assets, the software, the infrastructure and the know-how by itself. And let‚Äôs not forget the cities themselves who become more and more aware of their responsibility to regulate and influence the mobility in the cities. \nAs an example for the complexity, let‚Äôs take a look at car-sharing, which is only one form of mobility in a mobility ecosystem. With the fusion of Car2Go and DriveNow, two big rivals joined forces to master one part of the mobility ecosystem.', 'What elements do you think are essential when creating a mobility service or ecosystem?', ""The most important point is the understanding of the existing ecosystem and the competitive landscape. To understand if your service can improve the overall mobility landscape or if you‚Äôre just another bike-sharing company when there's already enough bikes on the street. You need to identify the white spots in the existing mobility ecosystem and solve them. That‚Äôs where you will easily attract customers and contribute sustainably to the mobility ecosystem. \nAdditionally, you will need a holistic frontend to the customer with all mobility services in one platform to enable the customer to easily create the optimal mobility offer for his need - with a simple price structure. Then you need the necessary data to offer a mobility service, where and how it‚Äôs needed, for example for demand prediction and the infrastructure to offer a seamless experience that can compete with the individual car, e.g. extra lanes, elderly-friendly stops, or a dense network."", 'How do you experience customer needs in the changing landscape of urban mobility?', 'Compared to 10 or 20 years ago, the customer structure has changed a lot. People want solutions that are tailored to their preferences because they are used to it from other areas in their lives. They want options that fit their current situations. Sometimes they are more price-sensitive, sometimes it‚Äôs time that matters, sometimes comfort. \nDue to an aging society, urban mobility needs to become more barrier-free and in general elderly-friendly ‚Äì especially when it comes to new mobility services, the inclusion of elderly and non-digital people is forgotten a lot.', 'Do you see big differences in urban and more rural areas?', 'While urban areas are the battlefield for most of the new mobility services, rural areas are left out. Due to the low density of rural areas, they are not interesting for mobility services. You would need many more vehicles or more empty driven kilometers to serve a rural area, than in an urban area. That‚Äôs simply not a good business case for private companies therefore it‚Äôs left to public transport.\nNevertheless, rural areas are crucial for solving traffic problems in the city. Because a lot of traffic in the city is caused by commuters coming into the city by car. As to the higher distances in rural areas, there‚Äôs no real alternative to a car.', 'How does data change the urban mobility game? ', 'Data is crucial for urban mobility. And there‚Äôs a lot of data generated out there every day: There‚Äôs data about infrastructure, movement data, weather, disruptions, mobility services, events and so on. Unfortunately, most of the data isn‚Äôt analyzed or used properly yet, as it is scattered across different players. Or it is not even generated, as most of the players still don‚Äôt like to share their data. \nThat‚Äôs a pity, because data can help you to understand the ecosystem and only  when you start to understand the complete system, it is a real game-changer for urban mobility.\nThe Open-Data-Platform by Transport for London is a good example for how a data-sharing platform could and should look like: when all mobility players understand their ecosystem, they can contribute to better mobility.', 'What is key for building a data-based mobility service?', 'Cooperation or even coopetition. Urban mobility is a complex system with a lot of influences.  Most companies don‚Äôt have all the necessary data to build and run a good mobility service. But to get data you also need to give some of your data and that‚Äôs where most companies struggle.\nTherefore, always question the data you have and the way you use it. The data itself can change fast and also the prerequisites for your business. It is key to use your data, not only to steer your operations but also to inform your customers. The information of a delay only isn‚Äôt satisfying to a customer. However, when you inform him why there‚Äôs a delay and show him alternatives, the customer experience of the situation is less negative.', 'What role does data play in your current decision making?', ""I use vehicle data ‚Äì especially when it‚Äôs about the requirements for development. The data helps me to understand how the customers are using their vehicles in their daily operations. This enables me to optimize the vehicles towards the customers' needs. When it comes to e-mobility, data is even more crucial. It‚Äôs a relatively new technology with some restrictions, e.g. the range. More batteries mean more range, but less transport capacity and vice versa. By understanding how the customers use the vehicles we can optimize the system towards the customer's needs."", 'Talking about urban mobility ecosystems - how do companies need to adapt to be ready for future changes?', 'I believe that mobility companies need to stop trying to do everything on their own and start to see themselves as part of something bigger ‚Äì cooperation and coopetition is key. \nCompanies need to get faster and more flexible to adapt to changing situations and demands and perhaps a bit more adventurous to try out new things.', 'About Ben Steinmetz', '', 'Ben is a Product Strategist at MAN Truck & Bus SE, where he creates new business models and works on the strategy for autonomous driving in the context of people transport.

https://futurice.com/blog/form-critique-with-love,Form critique with love,15 Jun 2020,Culture,Sharing is caring for the collective quality of design.,[],"['No one wants to be criticised. It is important to distinguish the concepts of criticism and critique from each other. Opinion based criticism can crush all creativity where instead well reasoned critique can collectively improve the quality of design.', 'A safe working culture isrequired for a designer to be ready to share their unfinished designs without the risk of losing ownership for the decision making over their design task. I will be describing the drivers for organising regularly design critique sessions. I will also describe the basis of a working culture in which designers can share their viewpoint what refers to ‚Äôgood design‚Äô all while maintaining their individual and subjective viewpoint to the topic.', ""A design critique session equals to resorting to another pair of eyes to take care of the design task. The designer's fatigue over their own work is a good reason why it is important to have an external view from time to time. It applies to a designer working alone as well as to a team of designers working together for a longer period. A design critique can be used to crowdsource where to which route the design could go next."", 'The Futurice 3x2 framework is a decision making framework. I will next refer to it to differentiate criticism from critique. Will the critique be handed in a form that affects the collegial relationship? Is the critique truly given for the benefit of the client? Is it possible to implement the fix in the given timeframe and with the budget available? Can the critique benefit future design projects? Or is it just your subjective viewpoint to begin with?', 'There are general signs of corroding criticism such as only finding the faults, concentrating constantly on the negative or acting without proper understanding of the bigger picture. And worst of all not focusing on the work but instead to the person behind it. Understanding the context and the person behind the design is important. A rule of thumb for delivering the critique is to start and end with a positive remark on some aspects in the design and add constructive feedback in the middle. Try maintain the minimum ratio of two constructive feedbacks to one positive remark.', 'Another way to approach the deliverance of constructive critique is to show empathy towards the colleague. Being honest with the aspects that might not work in the design and delivering it in a considerate manner. This is caring for your colleagues wellbeing and contributing to their professional growth. Designers do take their work personally. Some design decisions are less rational and hard to reason around. When suggesting an alternative viewpoint it could be just two individual viewpoints on the sidetracks. These expressions are acceptable when they are clearly framed correctly so that the designer can align their own subjective viewpoint to wether they agree. Rationale is usually king and is the base for constructive critique.', 'All design should be shared, critiqued or even criticised. Criticism is an effective tool for a community to gain a shared viewpoint by dividing itself, but a poor one to be used within the community as it also does divide individuals. A shared concept of ‚Äôgood design‚Äô makes it an easier topic for the community to be collectively discussed. Before a shared concept exists it is hard to approach the discussions as anything but individual viewpoints clashing. The leading designer, a collective of designers or an organisation where design is valued sets the benchmark for good design. This hegemony withstands for a shorter or longer period before being overtaken on a global or regional scale. Sharing a viewpoint also helps the community to diverge from that benchmark by still meeting the shared quality standards.', 'This is why sharing designs, views and viewpoints is important for improving the collective quality of design. Equally important it is to create a company culture where designers can feel safe to share designs. For a designer it all comes down to knowing that it is their viewpoint for the design task that matters in the end. The designers need to be willing to be challenged and when reasoned to change their minds or even admit of being wrong. It helps the designer to become more robust and truthful of their own design skills. Not being always correct does not make you a poor designer, but a better one.']",[]

Having worked for companies like Mainova, Enercity and E.ON, he has a solid understanding of the Energy business and its complex dynamics. He is convinced that Energy is the backbone of modern society as it‚Äôs strongly linked to how we live, move and produce. Below he shares his view on the challenges and opportunities of the energy sector with us.', 'Digital transformation is one of the key innovation drivers in the energy industry. Where should energy companies focus on when starting the transformation process?', 'There are different levels to focus on. From a strategic point of view, you should have a strong vision of where the company is heading and how you differentiate yourself from competitors. Think about your strengths, the most important assets, and megatrends like sustainability to get going. Methods like Futures Thinking are an excellent tool to develop strategies for different scenarios.', 'Besides, you need to think about data. The first step is to get an overview of the available data sets and to understand what you can do with them, before setting up a concrete data strategy. Devices like Smart Meters and Sensors have sparked many interesting cases on how to transform energy companies towards data-centric organizations.', 'From an operational perspective, energy companies should ask themselves what the biggest problems are that they are facing in different areas. Focus on customer and business user needs and look into benchmarks. How is the competition tackling certain problems and which impact will these problems have on customer satisfaction?', 'An innovation framework with matching tools will help you to address these problems. Take Lean Service Creation (LSC) for example: Starting from a problem worth solving and going over an MVP to scalable products, services, and new ways of working, LSC offers practical guidance on how to facilitate transformation projects, while focusing on a human-centered approach at all times.', 'Why is human centricity so important in securing business growth?', 'The world is changing at rapid speed - and Energy is no exception. Just think of the shift from coal, gas, or nuclear power towards renewables. To cope with this fundamental change, to transform the former core business and to open up new business opportunities, we have to be sure that the actions we take are matching the needs of clients and employees. For this reason, new business models should be tested as soon as possible with business users and clients to seek their feedback and insights. This will not only increase the acceptance of new tools but also test underlying assumptions.', 'Smart grids empower customers. How do they change the dynamics between producers and consumers?', 'In the last years, classic roles of producers, consumers, and grid providers have changed to a more collaborative model. One example is the rise of prosumers like homeowners and industrial plants with photovoltaic panels on their roofs. As they produce and consume energy at the same time, they get some autonomy from classic energy providers.', 'Another example is the rising popularity of smart meters. They help consumers to get an overview of their consumption profile and to detect saving potentials through changing routines or gearing up the infrastructure, e.g. with storage facilities. The backbone of this transformation is a grid that thinks one or two steps ahead and gives players data-based recommendations on when to store, sell, transform, or consume energy.', 'However, we are still at an early stage of this development. To become more efficient, our goal should be to modernize the infrastructure, to support existing practices with data-driven services, and to build new storage facilities. This setup would give us more flexibility when it comes to grid expansion or balancing peaks. Yet all of this will be in vain if we lose sight of the people. To make grids really smart, we have to connect stakeholders and build communities around them.', 'You mentioned data-driven services. Which role do data and AI play for smart grids?', 'It‚Äôs not only about smart grids. Data and AI have a great impact on nearly every aspect of the energy business - from production to transportation and consumption. For instance, demand prediction and digital twins as well as predictive maintenance are gaining traction in production. However, none of them would be possible without data and AI.', 'In general, digital solutions and physical infrastructure are increasingly linked. Individual data analysis shows how companies and private households can optimize their energy mix or consumption profile. On a bigger scale, the energy data of cities like Berlin or Munich can illustrate how to optimize the local infrastructure to lower CO2 footprints or increase revenue streams. Blended datasets can also help to open up new opportunities: Elenia, for instance, uses a situational awareness tool that combines disparate data sources and historical data to predict possible damages to electricity networks, which reduces the impact of power cuts on all levels.', 'Which further developments do you expect in the context of smart grid?', 'This is a tough question as the concept of smart grid involves many different layers: From the physical layer (e.g. production plans and cables) over data production (e.g. IoT devices) to services and communication (e.g. client-facing digital services).', ""On the physical layer, I expect a rise in the efficiency of renewable energy production entities. Costs for photovoltaic (PV) modules have already decreased significantly over the last couple of years. Tesla‚Äôs sunroof hints that those kinds of technologies will become even cheaper and less invasive than today's PV modules. In the near future, everyday objects like pavements, streetlights, or cars will have their own component to produce energy. Ideally, they will also be linked to a storage facility."", 'Besides, storage is an area where we can expect some radical shifts. At the moment, the predominant battery technology is lithium-ion batteries - which comes with a huge cost on the environment. And although the price for storage units has dropped significantly over the last years, it is still very expensive to store larger amounts of energy. This has to change. IBM for example has been experimenting with seawater as a storage component. The first results have been very promising, and their approach might go into serial production.', 'When it comes to IoT, the second generation of smart meters are currently being installed. However, this is just the beginning. In the future, almost all components in grids will generate data. This opens up new questions: How will we deal with these large amounts of data? Who owns it? And what can - and should - we do with it? This illustrates the importance of communication and transparency. It will become central to reduce complexity and empower users to make informed decisions. By connecting relevant stakeholders and transforming existing processes and tools, we will boost collaboration and create resilient ecosystems.', 'What role do smart grids play in connecting rural and urban areas?', 'Over the last years, there has been a strong focus on smart cities and their future. By contrast, the development of rural areas gained little attention. Nevertheless, it seems like the debate is changing and that energy companies are looking more into the needs of rural areas now.', 'Although the infrastructure of cities and villages is arguably different, people‚Äôs needs stay basically the same - especially when it comes to mobility, energy, information, health, or safety. Just imagine the future of mobility: A cost-efficient and customer-centric solution might look very different in a rural area than it does in a city; however, the underlying requirement remains to travel safely and quickly from A to B. Companies will have to adjust their mindset accordingly.', 'A deeper connection between rural and urban areas would also benefit the energy business. Building areas in cities are traditionally scarce and expensive, while there is plenty of land in the countryside. Link in agriculture, rural areas could provide electricity for the cities - especially if we think of onshore wind generation, large solar parks, or big storage facilities. By contrast, problems of connectivity and glass fiber coverage are typical problems of rural areas. Investments from energy companies could lead the way to solve this problem - or at least to finance the transition.', 'One of the greatest challenges when transforming the grid is balance. What can energy companies do to make the grid more resilient?', 'Resilience comes from preparing for different scenarios and training on how to react to them. Energy companies - just like all other companies - need to prepare for changes, to review their ways of working, and to foster collaborations with other companies. Besides, there are many ways how technology can make grids more efficient and resilient.', 'If they create digital twins, energy providers can run simulations and test different scenarios to detect possible bottlenecks and potential improvements to the grid, which creates better services and makes planning more cost-efficient. In addition, they can use digital tools that support collaboration, coordination, and transparency when different stakeholders like energy providers, telecommunication companies, workforces, or local authorities work on the modernization of the grid. Furthermore,  drones can be used to inspect the grid, which makes the work on high voltage pylons safer and more efficient. Lastly, cloud technologies enable companies to share information in a faster and more comprehensive way, while also improving the safety and resilience of the grid.', 'However, all of this is just a start. We are entering uncharted territory, and it will be exciting to learn what else we can do with the opportunities that new technologies hold for the energy business.', 'To learn more about our energy approach, check out our energy page.']",[]

We believe that it is the right thing to do both in terms of our people and clients but also for changing the structural biases in the society we operate in. Here I share what our journey has been like so far and what we have learned.', 'Our Diversity and Inclusion work started from a group of passionate individuals who saw that we need to embrace this topic. Care, one of the core values of Futurice, has been driving us already for a long time to be a workplace and culture that seeks to understand different people and treat each other with empathy. At the same time there was - and still is - a strong desire to make a positive impact in society. Therefore steps to start systematically focusing on D&I align with our goals as a company.', '', 'True inclusivity and diversity is not achieved in a single day, month, or year. In fact, inclusivity is never ‚Äúachieved‚Äù ‚Äî it is an ongoing process of learning that never ends. This process is a long game full of incremental improvements and we at Futurice have a long way to go. Developing an inclusive mindset requires humility; the willingness to hand the mic over to people in minority groups and listen mindfully to them, to be able to let go of our preconceptions of the world and admit that we might be wrong. To have an inclusive mindset is to continually learn and improve. It is an emotional labour ‚Äî  it brings up defensiveness and vulnerability. It challenges and dismantles the fundamental concepts of how the world works (in the point of view of privileged people, that is).', 'At Futurice we are at the very beginning of this journey. It is the time for us to listen, learn, and grow.', 'One of the very first practical things we did as part of the D&I workstream was to create a Futurice Code of Conduct in order to have a clearly defined common ground on what kind of behaviour we collectively expect from each other. The Code is available in our internal confluence as well as visible at all our offices in the format of posters. We also started to include a reminder about the Code to our party invites, and when we invite friends of Futurice to parties (who are not employees), we expect them to follow our Code. We have found out that small reminder posters/cards in toilets work quite well in party settings!', 'Our Code of Conduct sets the commonly agreed rules on how we treat each other', 'As the point of departure for our larger scale D&I work, we needed to understand the dimensions of those Futuriceans who are in non-dominant groups, and what their experiences are. We decided to conduct a Diversity & Inclusion audit. Our HR systems have limited demographic data, but we wanted to dig deeper in both qualitative and quantitative matters.', 'We partnered with an external D&I consultancy New Visions to carry out a Diversity & Inclusion audit to ensure anonymity and quality. We carried out the original audit in spring 2019.', 'The audit consisted of two parts: an in-depth survey for all the employees and on-site interviews. Participants volunteered for the interviews and there were no requirements to participate - but we found that most of these participants belonged to a non-dominant group and wanted to talk about their experiences.', 'The external consultancy carried out both of these, so the identities of those interviewed were never revealed to anyone within Futurice, nor the raw data from the survey. Instead, we received an in-depth (70+ pages) audit report of results, findings and recommendations for action.', 'Our aim with the audit was not to find out what the majority of our people think, but to really understand where our pain points are in terms of those on the margins.', 'We conducted a follow-up audit this spring - this time consisting only of the survey - to find out how we have progressed in our inclusion efforts. We are still waiting to receive the results of this latest audit.', 'Apart from the audit, we have also done some analysis of our own regarding our diversity. Based on our HR data we have created interactive diversity dashboards around gender and nationality of Futuriceans. The dashboards are available internally and due to their interactive nature, our people can adjust the data parameters and view the aspects that interest them the most.', 'Our Diversity dashboard allows any Futuricean to view some of our diversity dimensions in an interactive way', 'We got some very valuable core insights from the audit results, such as:', 'We shared the results of the audit transparently (as is typical for us), and facilitated conversations around them with our leadership at all of our offices.', 'The audit helped us to realise how we can grow our D&I work systematically. We understood that we must bring it close to our culture and also incorporate it into the company strategy.', 'We started by mapping out 3 horizons of focus for our D&I work, to give us a direction and scope our impact. Our first horizon focuses on improving the internal issues and has a heavy focus on inclusion. The second horizon expands our impact to our direct stakeholders - clients, candidates, partners and other stakeholders. The third and most ambitious horizon aims to impact society by changing the structural biases and inspiring others to do the same.', 'One of the concrete action points was to make sure all our team leads and leadership understand the subject and are able to be inclusive in their work. We started with this group as we saw that by getting them on board, the impact would reach further within the organisation. Therefore we organised Inclusive Leadership workshops for all the 110 Futurice leaders across 6 different offices. Next we are planning to run allyship trainings for all employees as well as targeted trainings for certain groups, such as Unconscious Bias workshop for recruiters which is coming up in the autumn.', 'We are also introducing the topic to all our new employees. In our quarterly Onboarding camps, where new starters gather from across all our offices, we have a session around inclusion, helping people to understand what they can personally do to be more inclusive and sharing personal experiences around exclusion.', 'We, like any other organisation, are unfortunately not immune to occasional cases of harassment. As this is something we do not want any Futuricean to be exposed to, we decided to take a deep dive into how those cases are handled and how we might improve the process. We created this process to strengthen the culture of speaking up but at the same time ensuring the safety of all Futuriceans - treating the victims with empathy and respect while solving the cases in a dignified and justified manner.', 'On top of the practical initiatives, it has been inspiring to see the shift in the mindset within Futurice. Diversity and inclusion topics have started to become part of the mainstream conversations and get the genuine attention of our people, including top leadership. We have also been directly involved with company-level strategy work and were able to bring the voice of D&I into the renewed company strategy.', 'We are learning as we go and we definitely have made - and will make - mistakes. We are learning from them, and becoming more and more self-healing on the way. There is still a lot to do, and we have a long way to go to reach our horizons, but we are committed to getting there together.']","['‚ÄúEqual‚Äù opportunities are not equal.  Not everyone starts from the same line, some have to face a lot more struggles to get there. You need to understand this, and offer extra support for those who may need it.', 'Diversity  and inclusion have to go hand in hand - for example, even if you are able to attract a diverse group of employees, if you can‚Äôt include them, they will move on to other opportunities', 'There are so many different kinds of diversity... and no one can be reduced to just one thing']"

At companies like Vattenfall or Elenia, he worked in IT development teams with varying tasks and responsibilities - from creating work order management solutions to developing digital service channels. During this time he got to see all the processes and IT systems that used to run ‚Äúthe grid‚Äù while being in close cooperation with many different stakeholders.', 'Providing electricity to everybody nonstop is a major responsibility. What is the biggest misconception in energy management today? ', 'There‚Äôs a lot of talk around Smart Grids, using electric vehicles as energy reserves, managing energy use in a more sustainable manner and other similar topics. However, in most cases the reality is still quite far away. Some tests like Tesla‚Äôs battery farm in Australia were a success , but most places are still technologically far from gaining the benefits of scale. Either it‚Äôs the lack of infrastructure, technical knowhow, legislation or a combination of all of these.', 'Energy innovation has increased at a rather steady speed over the past decade. In order to reach the energy demands for the future - what role will data play in speeding this up? ', 'When new energy sources such as solar and wind are added, predicting power generation becomes more and more relevant  to meet the demand. Just analysing historical data is not enough, since multiple different factors are in play when it comes to future consumption: How is the weather looking? Is it a public holiday and are many companies closed? Is the consumer on holiday and spending time elsewhere?', 'Based on predicted demand, the industry can also offer targeted solutions for consumers, e.g. by encouraging them to not use energy during a certain time. This opens new business models for many energy companies.', 'What will happen to energy companies that are not able to adapt? ', 'I see the highest risk for smaller energy companies that do not have the necessary resources to invest in the technical solutions which would be needed to enable new business models and two-way communication with end users. Unless these smaller companies team up and co-create suitable solutions, I would suspect bigger companies to acquire the smaller ones.', 'As demand response is rising fast in the EU, the need for interaction between distribution companies and energy traders is growing. What complications does this have and how can we solve them?', 'Distribution companies hold the keys when we want demand response to work on scale. They control a huge number of smart meters that allow individual households to be used as demand response reserves. Currently, the mechanisms for energy traders to tap into the distribution company owned devices is almost non-existent. Some parties have been piloting demand response by installing additional hardware to end user premises, but this solution doesn‚Äôt really scale. Utilising the existing smart meter infrastructure is the key but requires standardized mechanisms to exchange information between all parties.', 'At the same time, all of this needs to be easy for the end customers too. How will they benefit if they e.g. let someone control their water heaters? Companies need to point out the benefits - both environmental and financial ones - and set up an easy to use solution.', 'Cloud is said to increase growth, agility and efficiency in organisations. What role does cloud play in the future of energy?', 'Many energy companies are still a bit scared to utilize the cloud. Traditionally, all critical infrastructure has been running in their own data centers (or in their private cloud such as OpenStack, VMWare). However, as the world becomes more complex, the effort that it takes just to keep existing solutions running locally has become very difficult to manage.', 'By taking advantage of global scale cloud solution providers such as Amazon or Microsoft, energy companies can build highly available and scaling solutions while reducing the amount of time (and money) used to simply keep the infrastructure up and running.', 'Some companies are still worried about security and compliance but usually those worries are based on gut feeling originating from the early days of the cloud. Running critical infrastructure on cloud is basically even more secure than doing it inhouse. Just ask yourself: How much money do companies like Amazon or Microsoft invest in security? And how much are you? Getting your own datacenter the level of security these big players have would be simply too expensive for most companies.', 'Thinking cloud as an extension to your on-premise data center is a good start, it‚Äôs just another rack of servers, but with limitless capacity and a lot of out-of-the-box functionality companies have used to build from ground up themselves in the past.', 'Customer centricity is an integral part of business growth. How can companies leverage data to increase their customer success?', 'On a high level, using data e.g. to prevent power outages is really the biggest thing (even it‚Äôs quite invisible to the end users). Electricity is even more important than internet access and if the power goes out, so does customer satisfaction.', 'If we look at end users, individuals could get an alert when there are unusual energy consumption patterns (e.g. something wrong with their devices/physical premises) or a notification that suggests more cost efficient energy products for specific premises.', 'The environmental side is another thing. How is your energy consumption affecting the world and could you do something differently to do your part? Many grocery chains are already publishing your purchase history and its CO2 impact - could energy companies do the same?', ""The Paris agreement was created as a signed effort between 195 countries to keep the world's temperature from rising by 2¬∞C. Can data help to reach this goal?"", 'Sure! The demand response already mentioned is one way to use energy wisely, but also a lot of energy we use goes to waste and tapping into the consumption patterns could provide eye opening findings on our behaviour. Utilising home automation and other new smart devices can really cut our consumption which is good not only for the environment but also for our wallets.', 'Looking at the future of energy businesses - where do you see the biggest changes ahead?', 'Energy companies need to embrace the utilization of cloud platforms to really build scalable and highly available digital solutions. In addition, they will need to deepen the cooperation between energy sellers and distributors in more standardized ways, since building custom point-to-point solutions will not work out. A push from bigger players in the market could set an example and encourage companies to share innovative solutions for everyone. We need to be more proactive, as relying solely on laws and regulation tends to be pretty slow in a world where technology is moving at unprecedented pace.', '__To learn more about our energy approach, check out our energy page.\n']",[]

There is also a multitude of techniques you can use, from naive extrapolation of historical data to more sophisticated machine learning models. Some of the advanced techniques put considerable requirements on both the data, implementor and analysts, often making it hard to come up with stable performing forecast models. The nice thing about the Prophet library is that it is quite forgiving, meaning that it produces reasonable results out of the box. That said, Prophet is best suited for business-like time series with clear seasonality and where you know important business dates and events beforehand. It‚Äôs also, like with most time series tools, good to have a data set with observations that span a few years.', 'Lastly, Prophet is also quite easy to tune with its understandable hyper-parameters. In addition, it is extendable, so if you need to add additional regressors, seasonalities or special events you can do so easily.', 'Imagine that we work as data analysts at a bike rental start-up, let‚Äôs call it Acme Bikes, and we have gathered some data measuring people using their bikes to and from work. In addition, the dataset is augmented with historical rainfall and temperature data. We are asked to provide some insights into the dataset and provide a forecast model to estimate future commutes at any given time horizon. We are also asked to provide some indication of validity in the form of statistical tests. Are we up for it? But of course.', 'Prophet takes a novel approach and sees forecasting mainly as a curve fitting exercise using probabilistic techniques and inspiration from generalised additive models. We will not dive into the mathematical details in this article but for those inclined, I suggest reading the original Prophet paper.', 'The Prophet library is especially useful for business time series with clear seasonality and the knowledge of special events that have high impact on the data, for example, national holidays, Black Friday, the introduction of a new product, promotional campaigns and so on. To model time series Prophet separate the signal into the following additive components:', '\nProphet components', 'Where:', 'g(t) is the trend function which models non-periodic changes using either a non linear saturation growth model or piecewise linear regression model. You can configure this using parameters.', 's(t) is the seasonal functional (yearly, weekly and daily) which models the periodic changes in the value of the time series. This component is modelled using a Fourier transform and if you want you can add your own seasonalities.', 'h(t) represents the function for modelling holidays and special impact events. You can add your own set of custom holidays and special events.', 'Œµt is the models error/noise which is assumed being normal distributed', 'I think this approach is an intuitive and novel one and it‚Äôs easy for analysts to get a conceptual understanding of what makes up the predictions. Later on we are going to verify that the model actually works the way as described mathematically. If you‚Äôre interested in the mathematics and theory behind Prophet you can read their paper which nicely describes the rationale behind building the library in addition to diving deeper into the different components of the model.

Let‚Äôs remove all the weekends from our data and see how it looks.', '\nFig 2: Data without weekend commutes', 'Still some variability but considerable less. Hopefully much of the remaining variability can be explained by seasonality, holidays and our additional weather regressors: rain and temperature. We‚Äôll see shortly.', 'For time-series it‚Äôs often useful to do some form of power transform of the data to stabilise variance and make the data more normal distribution-like. But what transformation to use for the best result?

Let‚Äôs see if adding those as extra regressors will have any effect. Adding extra regressors is pretty straightforward but remember if you are going to use some in your forecast model you need to have the data present beforehand. With weather data this can be accomplished with weather forecasts. IMHO, the easiest and most solid extra regressors you can use are holidays and special dates that you know about, so I encourage you to do some extra work on those. But back to the weather data. We can add the rain and temperature data as extra regressors to the model like this (note that it‚Äôs only two code lines that change but I leave the whole listing for easy execution):', '\nFig 16: Plot with extra regressors rain and temperature', 'Looking at the plot it‚Äôs obvious that both rain and temperature are having an impact on the forecast.

https://futurice.com/blog/there-is-no-just-or-how-to-make-knowledge-transfer-work-better,How to make knowledge transfer work better,9 Jun 2020,Opinion,"In knowledge transfer, one of the common pitfalls is to use nonspecific, non-descriptive words that make the process unnecessarily complex and defeat the purpose. This is a short overview of what ","['There is no ""just""', 'Exhaustive knowledge transfer is the way']","['Here, I aim to convince the reader that in knowledge sharing, the word ""just"" must be considered a bad habit.', ""Disclaimer: the idea of this post came from someone's comment on social media some years ago and is not entirely mine. Unfortunately I am not able to recover the original comment today."", ""First, a short example. During one of my first lessons on horseback riding, I'm just sitting there and thinking, oh, the horse MOVES, it was so nice when it was just standing still, will I fall accidentally?"", 'We walk around the arena and the coach says ""just walk closer to the fence"". But, I am very new to all this. I do not know how you translate ""just move this way"" to actual commands to the horse in terms of its API, that is, through the bridle and my legs (you are supposed to use the inside leg and push in a certain way).', 'Knowledge transfer occurs when someone is trying to learn the ways of a project, perhaps with the added complexity of entirely new (for them) technological stacks. It is not often that the new things are intuitively perceivable. Some undocumented details from that rushed initial phase or legacy core, a non-straightforward CI/CD setups, or simply a new cloud platform. There are always missing parts of the picture. And that\'s ok - it doesn\'t matter who you are now, as long as you can learn at a good enough speed. And the word ""just"" is the last thing we want to hear in such a situation because often you need to go to severe, almost painful cognitive fiction trying to figure out what ""just"" means - ask more questions, google around, et cetera. And this is all for just one step! Probably after that step, there will be a hundred of other steps, which, in this way, will take considerable time, burn your brain and demotivate you massively. Not only are you in pain for trying to work things out, but you also are not at your best speed - a lot of energy dissipates into figuring out the vague suggestions, so you are stalled in your tracks and actually look worse than you are. Additionally, the mood in the team ends up tense - the new person may have the impression that colleagues do not take collaboration seriously, start to worry that they withhold the knowledge intentionally or whether the situation reflects a frustrating state of the entire company‚Äôs work processes.', 'As a paper in Psychology Today suggests, there is one more issue with ‚Äújust‚Äù:', '‚ÄúJust‚Äù is a command to ignore all other possibilities. We use it to direct, even commandeer people‚Äôs attention, to get them to focus where we want. It‚Äôs an attempt to treat life‚Äôs subjective, guesswork interpretation as cold hard fact. It‚Äôs fake objectivity, as though you‚Äôre just calling a spade a spade rather than voicing an opinion. It‚Äôs a gambit to stop debate, to get people to adopt your opinion, and be done with it.‚Äù', 'So, some people may even get deceived by ‚Äújust‚Äù, and this is another reason to be wary of the word in any professional interaction.', 'So I believe that ""just"" should never be used in knowledge sharing. Saying something short is convenient for the knowledgeable person themselves. They might feel that the question distracted them from their flow, so they are tempted to get rid of a distraction with the least amount of energy and move on with their tasks. If they give in to the temptation, ‚Äújust‚Äù happens. On the contrary - it should be convenient for the recipient of the knowledge because the knowledge is only useful once it is transferred correctly. Knowledge sharing is an investment in future progress speed-up by adding new collaborators to the team.', 'What does proper instruction look like?', 'Even though I call here for spending some more energy on the knowledge transfer, it does not mean we should not be smart about it and transfer small and large chunks of knowledge in the same way. If something takes a lot of explanations and requires many hours or days of work to put it down in writing, I would usually do a screencast that I record. You will be surprised how much knowledge is transferable in such a way for just in 30 minutes of work, and how easy it is to recover it, say, in a year. Precise can be also relatively easy.', 'We all know that unit tests should be self-sufficient, right? Setup, test, tear down; leave no loose ends. The same self-sufficiency should be true about knowledge sharing and documentation. Leaving ‚Äúmental black holes‚Äù in the text defeats the purpose of its very existence. Not only is the word ""just"" forbidden (unless you refer to a truly trivial matter). Any words like ""good"", ""bad"", ""sufficient"" and the like are open for interpretation and guesswork and only make sense to the writer of documentation because they know the additional context. So it is a duty of the documentation author to provide the same context to the new readers. Say clearly, what ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù means in numbers so there is no telepathy required when someone relies on your foundation.', ""Yes, it is a bit tedious to write a self-sufficient text. But it's also an investment - a written or recorded material can be re-used on those new people many times, saving the precious time and concentration of the experts; that is, if experts have not moved on completely."", 'So, should we spoon-feed new team members? No, they can take studies themselves too, but under the guidance and in a systematic way. That guidance and system is the duty of the more experienced colleague. I had a pretty good experience telling a person who never worked in Java and never saw my very lengthy code, how to work independently. What I did was first scheduled an hour-long meeting where I drew the building blocks on a whiteboard and showed them how to get the code running and insert breakpoints. Then I show how to trigger incoming API calls and simply assigned homework - to go and trace the calls one by one. They ended up with a short text that perfectly documented the business logic flow. Later, we held another meeting with some additional explanations and questions/answers, and by then they were ready to tackle feature changes.', 'There is a powerful resistance in the brain that tries to avoid cognitive friction, and it requires a certain amount of discipline to do what has to be done. Yet, the proper documentation is a part of our work and it should be done rigorously, just like the rest.']","['How do I do operation X?', 'Please make sure you have credentials Y found at the link Z.

https://futurice.com/blog/why-customer-centricity-is-key-to-succeeding-in-the-energy-business,Why customer-centricity is key to succeeding in the energy business,8 Jun 2020,Technology,Customer-centricity will be the key to retaining and building customer bases in the future.,"['Higher expectations', 'It‚Äôs a digital effort', 'The building blocks of customer-centricity', '1. Products', '2. Communication', '3. Customer journey thinking', '4. Corporate culture']","['The European energy sector is going through radical changes as new technologies enable new service offerings and business models. At the same time, established, incumbent companies are facing increasing competition from new players. In a volatile market situation, customer-centricity will be the key to retaining and building customer bases in the future.', 'For decades, the energy sector in Europe has been characterized by rigid delivery structures, regional monopolies, and stable customer bases with low churn rates. Consumers have also had little to say about new developments and advancements. For example, until very recently, end users in Germany had no choice or say over what type of electricity metering equipment would be installed in their homes. Instead, the supplier was force-fed based on what the regional government had authorized.', 'These days, Germany ‚Äì along with a growing number of other EU countries ‚Äì has passed legislation that aims to smarten utility meters (for gas, electricity, and water) and steers infrastructure companies to gradually install smart meters to business and residential properties. There is a really good reason behind this: with more accurate consumption data, it is easier to raise actionable awareness of sustainable use of scarce resources.', 'Historically, very few consumers have been particularly aware of the intricacies of utility meters. But that is changing now that they know they‚Äôll be the ones to foot the bill for the smartening effort, as the meters are legally prescribed by the government.', 'When done right, the smart meter ecosystem has the potential to be the ‚ÄúiPhone of the energy sector‚Äù experience, or at least the catalyst for that transformation. On the other hand, if it‚Äôs done poorly, energy brands are in for a massive hit in customer loyalty. It will be mandatory for them to communicate to their customers in a way that takes users beyond mere acceptance of force-fed smart meters.', 'Consumers‚Äô expectations are growing constantly, especially when it comes to digital services. Now that energy products and services have become replaceable after decades of unilateral dictation, consumers are examining their relationships with incumbent regional power companies more critically than before, and paying attention to what could be better. This, combined with liberalized energy markets and a political push for sustainable energy mean that power companies will have to update their playbooks sooner rather than later.', 'One of the most crucial elements in those revised playbooks will be a customer-centric approach to doing business. For decades, research about the so-called ‚Äúdelivery gap‚Äù has been pointing out that companies tend to have an overly positive perception of their customer experience when compared to the actual experience as reported by their customers. Possibly the single most important benefit of customer-centricity is that it will enable power companies to bridge that delivery gap, help retain, grow and refine their customer base, and ultimately, stay relevant in the evolving market.', 'Within the energy sector, too, a more customer-centric approach will rely largely on digital platforms and services that shape the entire customer experience and have a huge impact on consumers‚Äô everyday lives.', 'Additionally, digital services will influence what consumers expect from their power company. If the supply side fails to act now, they will have problems keeping their customers satisfied in the future. Instead of focusing only on their competitors, power companies should be taking cues from successful entertainment, retail and mobility services, and aim for the same standard of customer experience that they provide.', 'To stay in the game, power companies will have to look at the playing field beyond the usual regional competitors in the energy sector. Competing for customers‚Äô time, attention, and money will demand a broader view that includes platform players such as Amazon, Tesla, or Bosch, as well as well-funded disruptive start-ups in the smart home and mobility domains.', 'There is also one major caveat to mention here. Large-scale investments in user-centric value-adding services require an extensive and steady user base to bring a reasonable return on investment. A small user base, and particularly one in flux, will generate very little useful data and revenue to support continuous offering development sustainably.', 'Now that we‚Äôve established that customer-centricity is essential, there‚Äôs just one question ‚Äì how can you implement customer-centricity to deliver tangible results in the energy business? There are four key aspects to consider, which I will now cover:', 'True customer-centricity requires companies to thoroughly rethink the way they develop products and services. The focus of product development must be placed on customer benefit. There are various ways for companies to shift their perspective ‚Äì for example, dedicated co-creative product development methodologies such as Lean Service Creation.', 'When it comes to customer-centric communication, it makes sense to move away from a unidirectional and anonymous relationship between the power company and its customers, and towards deeper, bespoke forms of 1:1 interaction. This transition will involve changes such as using communication channels that the customer prefers, engaging the customer more selectively, and as frequently as the customer has indicated. New ways to tailor and present information specifically for each customer will also play a big role here.', 'Customer journeys are a way to picture and describe the interactions of a customer with the power company. In order to optimize customer journeys and, ultimately, reach a high level of customer satisfaction, interaction points (also known as touchpoints) as well as all experiences over the course of an interaction should be centered on the customer. Handling them correctly is important, as negative experiences have the tendency to hurt customer satisfaction to a much greater extent than positive experiences are able to reinforce it.', 'In order to transform everyday work and make it customer-centric, it is crucial for managers and employees alike to internalize a customer-oriented mindset, and also execute it with customer-oriented actions. This will require a high degree of adaptability to changing customer needs as well as willingness to work with colleagues in agile project teams, and cooperate with external partners and customers.', 'For more than 100 years, the energy industry has been focusing almost exclusively on the nuts and bolts of power generation and distribution. To ensure companies stay relevant for the next century, it is imperative that they invest in understanding customer needs and preferences, figuring out which parts and roles of the ecosystem they can (and should) realistically hang on to in the future, and establishing new revenue models that will help keep them in the game.', 'Luckily, many companies in the field still have a large user base that can be tapped into in order to generate valuable user insights with the right tools.

She has been involved in power market insight and price forecasting, production planning and sales as well as hedging and financial trading with Nordic and Russian energy markets. She is also currently a member of the board of directors at Helen.', 'At Futurice Pirja has continued to focus on the energy sector working with various clients, driving their digital development and business success.', 'Which are the current interesting developments in the energy sector?', 'Looking at the current developments in the market, I think that there are a couple of very interesting development areas.', 'One is definitely the increasing amount of intermittent solar and wind production. As the production of these energy sources varies based on the weather, there is a need for close to real time management of flexible energy sources and energy storages as well as active demand response management. All this will increase price volatility. So, there will be more and more opportunities to capture value for those who have flexible production or ability to vary the loads and who build proper tools to enable this.', 'Another interesting area is smart metering and datahub. Smart metering enables closer to real time metering of locational consumption of electricity. All this location based consumption data will be collected in the datahub. In Finland the datahub is planned to be in place in 2022. This will offer opportunities for energy companies as well as new entrants to develop new data based consumer services.', 'Data, analytics and AI has become an increasingly important topic in business. What role does it play in the energy sector?', 'Energy companies use a lot of data. In production there is real-time data from production, weather and hydrological forecasts and actual measurements, historical data on power prices, production and consumption. Different models are built based on the data to forecast electricity market prices, optimize the production and for example develop algorithm based financial trading strategies. On the sales side smart metering and datahub offer better possibilities for forecasting energy consumption in different customer segments. Datahub will also enable the management and aggregation of small scale demand responses from e.g. electrically heated households or batteries of electric vehicles or development of other consumer services.', 'Can you share any good examples of companies that are using data, advanced analytics or AI to improve their business performance?', 'Fortum Apollo is a good example where Futurice has been involved. Apollo is a production planning tool that uses a stochastic optimization model to optimize the use of hundreds of hydropower resources. It provides the user with an interface to define the desired input as well as an easily understandable way to view and analyse the resulting scenarios. One optimization may involve tens of thousands of different time series, so managing and storing the input & output data in a structured way was an important issue, along with the performance optimization of the whole system.', 'Apollo improves the hydro asset efficiency which is good for the bottom-line of the business and the environment.', 'What does it take to build data and AI augmented decision support systems?', 'Building largely automated and advanced analytics & AI augmented decision support systems takes a long time. You need to develop an optimization model or a forecasting algorithm, which is experimental work by nature and requires deep knowledge on advanced analytics, machine learning etc. But that is not enough. As experts use these models to support their decision making, you need to ensure the usability of them and define human-model interaction: What type of input is needed and how will you visualise and analyse the results. In addition, you need to ensure close to real time quality data. This requires proper solutions for data governance and storage. Scalable cloud based solutions would offer performance and flexibility.', 'Why do energy companies need a systematic approach for capturing opportunities with data and analytics?', 'Developing very complex models is not a one time task but requires continuous development - and it can take years. One should start with simpler models and improve them along the way. In addition, it is not enough to only build the model, you also need proper data flows and storages. To make this happen requires investment into right competences and systems. In conclusion it is important to have a long term vision and to capture the value from data and analytics in bits and pieces along the road.', 'How can scenario based forecasting help to increase productivity in times of crisis?', 'Scenario-based forecasting makes it possible to run several different production plan scenarios. It also makes it possible to create a new production plan on short notice as the situation changes. This helps you to prepare and react when there is a lot of uncertainty about the future.', 'If you think about the future of energy, where do you expect the biggest challenges?', 'I think that the biggest challenge is that when we move towards cleaner intermittent energy production there is an increasing need for more active management of the whole energy system closer to delivery. We are already seeing periods of negative electricity prices. Negative prices basically imply that someone would be willing to pay for you to consume electricity. Meaning that there is not enough flexibility in the system.Therefore, there is a need to aggregate and actively manage all, even small, flexible elements: flexible production, energy storages, such as EV or heat batteries, as well considering households as both consumers and producers. Intelligent largely automated solutions are needed to enable this.', 'And all these problems could be solved if there was a viable solution for large scale storage of electricity.', 'To learn more about our energy approach, check out our energy page.']",[]

In this interview he shares his perspective on the future of urban mobility with us. ', 'Looking at the ongoing changes in urban mobility, which trends and misconceptions do you observe?', 'Mobility is changing, especially in urban areas. Modular and shared mobility services will be on the rise. However, the drop in demand in public transport and shared mobility services due to Covid-19 show how fragile this change still is. Those services are still at an infant stage and hence prone to various impacts of all kinds. It also turns out that shared mobility services on their own will not reduce urban traffic but need to be integrated in an overall urban mobility offering. This offering needs to be seamless for the user to drive acceptance on a large scale, avoid cannibalization of public transport and reduce traffic in urban areas or keep it at least constant in times of global urbanization.', 'But this requires not only technological changes such as efficient alternatives to combustion engines or automated driving. Autonomous vehicles will still commute - although autonomously and even more efficient due to concepts like platooning. But if every autonomous vehicle transports only one passenger, traffic won‚Äôt be decreasing. It needs new offerings but also new incentives to break up with common patterns of behavior, such as preferring commuting alone for the sake of personal freedom. So, we do have to discuss urban mobility on a wider scale and have to take social aspects as well as new work concepts like home office into consideration to design urban mobility of the future. This includes new retail concepts which might lead to a decrease in urban delivery traffic but on the other side an increase in delivery traffic in sub-urban areas. And finally, we have not yet spoken about the third dimension: mobility concepts of PAVs/drones and drone taxis.', 'Talking about T√úV S√úD, where do you see the role of your company in the urban mobility landscape?', 'In mitigating risks - these risks are becoming and will remain more virtual and more complex in the future. Performance of vehicles is more and more determined by software components rather than by hardware. Each update, in the future over the air, might affect not only single components of a vehicle but the overall system. Hence, software and its updates need to be monitored in a continuous way. This especially applies to autonomous vehicles. Periodic inspections will need to be supported by continuous monitoring of safety critical events. And finally, the security of a system needs to be guaranteed to avoid manipulation of vehicles from the outside. Our aim is to inspire trust in new mobility technologies and thus enable progress by managing technology-related risks ‚Äì to facilitate change.', 'How do you experience customer needs in the changing landscape of urban mobility?', 'Based on our everyday experiences we more and more experience customers looking for seamless solutions and value propositions which are integrated in our daily, individual routines. This applies to commercial and business customers alike. And it especially applies to digital natives. Besides that, we see how events like the Covid-19 pandemic suddenly change urban mobility but also the responsiveness to digital solutions. The Covid-19 situation shows how fast user patterns can change. So for example, the demand for (e)bikes has strongly increased and mobility patterns have already been affected.', 'Do you see big differences in urban and more rural areas?', 'Rural areas still heavily rely on individual mobility since the fragmented demand makes economically sustainable offerings of shared mobility at least complicated. Most shared business models suit urban areas with higher demand and economies of scale due to higher frequency and utilization rates. Therefore, solutions in those rural areas will be different and may have to lead towards flexible, individualized public transport offerings and a stronger impact of peer-2-peer sharing concepts.', 'Urban mobility is tightly connected to data - how can we ensure a secure and trustworthy usage of data?', 'First of all, we need to ensure trustworthy data along all kinds of processes, stretching from the generation of data in autonomous vehicles to the usage of data for example as secondary usages. Data integrity needs to be guaranteed and data acess should be free of possible discrimination.', 'This also includes access right management and transparency of who is dealing with what kind of data. Ecosystems will create compelling new, data-driven value propositions to individuals. But the handling of data, data streams, data processing, data storage and data access must be transparent, free of discrimination, trustworthy and in relevant areas even certified.', 'Which role is data playing in your current decision making?', 'As mentioned before, data is becoming more relevant as the importance of software is rising. The relevance of pure physics diminishes. Continuous monitoring of data, its visualization and simulation will become paramount to assess the safety and security of vehicles and to make the change to automated and even autonomous driving happen. But once again, this data must be correct, transparent, and accessible and data integrity needs to be given.', 'Which technologies do you see as the most important ones in the future of mobility ecosystems?', 'At a first glance, of course alternate propulsions like hydrogen and technologies needed for automated and autonomous mobility solutions come into mind, like for example LIDAR, which need to be reliable and must operate safely without failure rates. But infrastructure technology is equally important to foster safe, secure and reliable car-2-x communication. We need powerful communication infrastructure like 5G networks to cope with immense data streams. And finally, we need technologies and platforms to guarantee privacy and data integrity to leverage the value of data driven value propositions.', 'Talking about urban mobility ecosystems - how do companies need to adapt to be ready for future changes?', 'Get connected with partners for integrated, joint value propositions, think digital and watch out for seamless and integrated value propositions and data flows.', 'About Dr. Martin Vetter', '', 'Dr. Martin Vetter is heading the Innovation team of Division Mobility at T√úV S√úD.

We might be on the home turf of machine learning, if the outcome depends on a large number of interacting factors (an image recognizer must make sense of a large collection of pixels) or if the variation is large (cat pictures should be labeled as cats no matter the cat breed, pose or the picture background). The type of data itself is also related to complexity: advanced video processing and speech recognition is mostly machine learning nowadays.', ""Machines do not have common sense. They can't tell if the results they output are good or bad. Such feedback is, however, crucial in machine learning. Without it, learning an algorihtm is not possible. Therefore, it's essential that the people on the product team define clearly what constitutes a correct answer on a prediction task."", ""Before starting a project, imagine that you had a magical box that claims to output the answer to the question you are interested in. How would you tell if the result is correct? If you don't know, you can't train a machine learning algorithm."", ""In the best case, there exists an unambiguous right answer.

Machine learning excels in the kind of tasks where everybody can agree on the evaluation. The narrower the task, the smarter the AI seems."", 'Sometimes the evaluation criterion is clear in principle but complicated to measure in practice. Everybody might agree that the purpose of a recommender system is to increase sales. But to really verify that this is indeed what happens, you need to have the technical capability to conduct A/B tests.', 'Things get even muddier, if people legitimately disagree on what should be the goal.

Expert‚Äôs intuition can tell if the task has patterns that a computer might learn to exploit. Learning is easy if an expert has a solid grasp of factors that affect the outcome. Predicting when an industrial machine will fail is doable if engineers understand well enough which physical factors affect the chance of failure.', ""When we move beyond solid expertise, learning gets more uncertain. If we can't measure all relevant variables, the prediction quality quickly plummets. Predicting whether it will rain tomorrow is doable, because we can measure the relevant atmospheric variables with sufficient accuracy, but predicting when the next earthquake will hit is considerably more difficult, because we don't yet even understand the physics of plate tectonics well enough."", 'Training of machine learning models usually requires lots of training data. The data is the way to indicate the desired output to a computer: ""when you encounter a sample that is similar to this one you have seen before, output this label"".', ""Just any old data won't do, either. It has to be representative of the kind of situations the model is expected to encounter in operational use. Machines blindly learn patterns they see in the training data. If the training data is biased in some way, the predictions will also be."", ""Each training sample instance must come with a correct answer attached. If you don't happen to have access to suitable labelled data, the samples need to be explicitly labeled. This means human labor and can get time consuming. If you don't have labels, prediction is not possible but you might still be able to gather insights or utilize data in other ways."", ""Finally, the task should be such that it is worthwhile to automate it. Perhaps the task is repetitive, boring or expensive to do by hand.

But there‚Äôs a lot left to be done in terms of solution architecture and service design before the entire ecosystem is ready.,"['Demand response in a nutshell', 'Ready to say goodbye to the dumb era?', 'Getting the ecosystem in shape', 'Consider the big picture']","['European energy markets are evolving at a rapid pace, and some of the most impactful new developments in the next five or ten years will revolve around demand response. But there‚Äôs a lot left to be done in terms of solution architecture and service design before the entire ecosystem is ready.', 'On the EU level ‚Äì and consequently, in the EU member states ‚Äì there is a strong push to renew energy markets and develop them into a more environmentally friendly direction. There are plenty of interesting concepts in development, but in all likelihood, the next big thing in the pipeline will be large-scale demand response.', 'There are two clear reasons for this. First and foremost, implementing demand response at scale will introduce a new dimension into energy markets, and a shift in the operating logic of the value chain. Secondly, that end-to-end shift will ultimately affect millions of consumers and businesses, giving them new kinds of benefits and flexibility in energy use.', 'The principal idea of demand response has been floating around for some time, and it‚Äôs not particularly complex. By enabling participating users to have their energy use adjusted remotely by the distributor, it makes it easier for power companies to manage their generation capacity when demand is high.', 'It‚Äôs a big step forward from previous attempts to steer consumers to time their energy-intensive activities towards low-demand hours with dynamic pricing. With demand response, adjustments are made with minimal user interaction, based on requests from power companies during demand peaks.', 'This enables energy producers to keep fewer power generation units running during peak hours and reduces their dependence on coal and oil-based reserve power. As a result, energy use becomes more efficient, and the strain on the environment is reduced. End users, in turn, get a corresponding reimbursement in their electricity bill.', 'In the big picture, an individual household is and always will be a small contributor for the purposes of demand response ‚Äì but if that potential is scaled up, the game changes entirely. Taking demand response beyond individual implementations and harnessing it at scale in the consumer market has been bottlenecked by ‚Äúdumb‚Äù grid infrastructure on the one hand and limited options for storing energy on the other. But as we enter the 2020s, solutions already exist to both of these problems.', 'First and foremost, smart metering has been growing steadily over the past couple of years. Smart meters will have a substantial role in increasing the flow of data throughout the value chain and enabling new remotely controlled data-reliant services for end-users. In the future, next-generation smart meters with real-time measuring capabilities will take the service potential even further.', 'Similarly, high-capacity batteries have found their way into many homes thanks to increasing solar panel use. Electric vehicle batteries are expected to become another significant factor in the coming years as the EV market share grows and two-way charging infrastructure becomes more commonplace.', 'With these prerequisites covered, consumers will have all the tools they need to ride the prosumer wave and become more active participants in the energy ecosystem. All it will take for them is to check one extra box in an agreement with their power company. But in reality, the ability to participate won‚Äôt be enough to get people to actually do so. To be able to sell energy back to the grid, they‚Äôll have to allow a third party to remotely manage their energy use, and prioritize functions like heating, cooling and household appliances.', 'To many consumers, the mere thought may seem scary, even given the financial incentive. Exactly no one wants to be plagued by blackouts or subjected to unbearably high or low temperatures in their own home. It‚Äôll take a lot of effort to successfully turn that discussion around and reassure them that the adjustments are, in fact, prioritized so that they will not affect their quality of life in any way. To a large extent, this will be a communication issue that calls for careful and effective messaging.', 'There is also plenty of work to be done to prepare the rest of the energy ecosystem for widespread demand response applications. The road will likely be a bit rocky due to the lack of any standardization in this area, and as a result, EU member states will have to work on their own approaches based on their individual starting points.', 'In many countries, parts of the core infrastructure already exist or are at least being built. For example, in Finland, a centralized information exchange system known as the Datahub, which will eventually handle all the data and information exchange processes related to demand response, is scheduled for completion in 2022.', 'Similarly to EU member states, distribution companies are facing a related dilemma as they work out the finer details for adjusting energy use in participating households. Certain guiding principles on matters like communication have been agreed on, but execution remains up in the air. The end result will likely be very heterogeneous on this level, too.', 'While large-scale demand response is still a thing of the future, there are many crucial things for companies in the energy ecosystem to consider already at this stage. The architecture and any technical solutions will have to deliver when coupled with real-world business cases, and account for the needs of all stakeholder groups, from power and distribution companies to consumers. The only way to approach this is to look at the big picture and build everything as a whole, from concept design to execution.', 'For many distribution companies, the use of cloud is still unexplored territory. But in order to build dependable and resilient production environments for their services, they will eventually have to step out of their comfort zone and embrace scalable cloud services. The same goes for putting their data to use and harnessing AI. Security will also play an equally important role, as the services will need multiple safeguards to mitigate threats and convince end-users to participate.', 'Make no mistake, tackling demand response is going to be a huge task for the whole energy value chain, and especially distributors. There‚Äôs too much business to be lost by sitting this one out, so ignoring the challenge is simply not an option. At the same time there‚Äôs a lot of ground to cover, and a positive and balanced end-to-end outcome depends on people from many different areas of expertise coming together and working seamlessly as a cross-competence team.', 'We know demand response is going to be a tough nut to crack alone. And that‚Äôs the thing ‚Äì companies don‚Äôt have to do it on their own, because there is help available.', 'At Futurice, we‚Äôve worked with all parts of the energy sector value chain in several roles ‚Äì from concept creation to service design, from cloud architecture to software development, and from data engineering to business consulting.

However, what started as a minimal auth layer has grown with features. What I have come to appreciate is that the reverse proxy is a great layer to do a variety of cross-cutting concerns like auth, at-least-once delivery and adapting. Furthermore, I have found OpenResty provides amazing performance and flexibility, AND it fits the serverless paradigm almost perfectly.', 'Concretely I have been working on extending the IAP to ingest and reshape signals from Slack and Zapier, tunnel them through a Write Ahead Log (WAL) and verify their authenticity all before they hit our application binary. It turns out there are huge technical advantages in doing these integrations at the proxy layer.', 'The first win for the proxy is as a general purpose adapter. You often need to change the shape of the JSONs being exchanged between independently developed services. Given the utility of wrapping services with a common auth layer anyway, it makes sense this is a convenient point to do the domain mapping too. With OpenResty you get to do this in a performant binary.', ""The second win was using the proxy to minimize response latency. Slack insists bots reply within 3 seconds. If an upstream is a serverless JVM process, you can easily timeout when upstream is cold. We solved this in the proxy layer, by buffering incoming requests into a managed queue, somewhat like a Write Ahead Log (WAL). This meant we could lower latency by replying to Slack's webhook as soon as the queue acknowledged the write. As OpenResty is c + lua, so fast to startup we do the best we can in a serverless environment."", ""With the WAL, we get at-least-once delivery semantics. Putting a WAL at the proxy layer can paper over a ton of upstream reliability issues. This implies that as long as upstream is idempotent, you don't need retry logic upstream. This simplifies application development, and widens the stack choice upstream. Specifically for us, it meant a slow start JVM binary did not need to be rewritten in order to be deployed on serverless."", 'Finally we could verify the authenticity of incoming messages fast, so that potential attacks are stopped before consuming more expensive resources upstream. Again, OpenResty is likely to be faster (and therefore cheaper) than an application server at this rote task. We found it relatively painless to store secrets in secretmanager and retrieve them in the proxy.', 'Overall we found that OpenResty is almost the perfect technology for Serverless. It gives you C performance (response latency as low as 5ms), fast startup times (400ms cold starts on Cloud Run) and the production readiness of Ngnix, all whilst giving you the flexibility to customize and add features to your infrastructure boundary with Lua scripting.', ""It's worth noting that Cloud Run scales to zero (unlike Fargate) and supports concurrent operations (unlike Lambda and Google Cloud Functions). OpenResty + Cloud Run will allow you to serve a ton of concurrent traffic on a single instance and thus I expect it to be most cost efficient out of the options. While its cold start is higher than, say, Lambda (we get 400ms vs 200ms), because it needs less scaling events, I expect incidents of cold starts to be less frequent for most deployments."", ""Having the proxy handle more use cases (e.g. retry logic) moves cost out of application binaries and into the slickest part of the infra. You don't need a kubernetes cluster to reap all these benefits, but you could deploy it in a cluster if you wish. We have managed to package all our functionality into a single small serverless service, deployed by Terraform, MIT licensed."", 'Now I will talk more specifics about how our particular development went, and how we solved various tactical development issues. This will probably be too detailed for most readers, but I have tried to order them by generalizability.', 'The slowness of Cloud Run deployments prevented intricate proxy feature development, so the first issue to solve the local development problem. As Cloud Run ultimately deploys dockerfiles, we used a docker-compose to bring up our binary along with a GCE Metadata Emulator.\n    Our dockerfile is generated from Terraform templates, but you can ask Terraform to generate that local file, without deploying the whole project, with the -target flag. Thus we can create a semi decent development loop by sequencing terraform artifact generation and docker-compose in a loop, and no need to rewrite the Terraform recipe to support local development!', '', 'With the above shell script, when you press CTRL + C in the shell the binary will update and rerun. The tricky bit is exiting this loop! If you invoke it with ""/bin/bash test/dev.sh"" it will be named bash so you can exit with ""killall bash"". The Oauth 2.0 redirect_uri will not work with localhost, so you will need to copy prod tokens with /login?token=true from the prod deployment.', 'To be able to confidently respond to incoming requests fast, a general purpose internal location /wal/‚Ä¶ was added to the proxy. Any request forwarded to /wal/<PATH> was assumed to be destined to be for UPSTREAM/<PATH>, but would travel via a Pub/Sub topic and subscription. This offloads the persistent storage of the buffer to a dedicated service with great latency and durability guarantees.', 'Each WAL message is essentially encapsulating a HTTP request. So the headers, uri, method and body were placed in an envelope and sent to PubSub. The request body was mapped to the base64 encoded Pub/Sub data field, and we used Pub/Sub attributes to store the rest.', '', 'Calling Pub/Sub is a simple POST request to a topic provisioned by Terraform.', 'A Pub/Sub subscription was provisioned that will push the envelopes back to the proxy to location /wal-playback. By specifying an oidc_token, Pub/Sub will add an ID token that can be verified in the proxy.', '', 'In the OpenResty config we expose /wal-playback to the internet, but we verify the incoming token before unpacking the envelope and sending upstream.', 'For our use case our upstream was hosted on Cloud Run too. If the upstream response was status code 429 (Too Many Requests) this means the container is scaling up and should be retried. Similarly, a status code 500 means upstream is broke and the request should be retried. For these response codes the proxy returns status 500 to Pub/Sub, which triggers its retry behaviour, leading to at-least-once delivery semantics.', 'In our deployment the Zapier and Slack integrations used the /wal/ proxy.', 'We wanted to boost internal productivity by adding custom ""slash commands"" to our internal business workflow engine.

On the contrary, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), disability is a ‚Äúuniversal human experience‚Äù ‚Äì everyone can experience disability in certain situations or times in their life. Society is based on a multitude of individuals with varying abilities. Therefore, society as a whole ‚Äì from the built environment to our tools, products, and services ‚Äì has to account for the variability of the human body. Consequently, when building tomorrow‚Äôs products and services, designers need to consider the diversity of society and prevent exclusion caused by design.', 'In this blog post, I will summarise my learnings from five interviews I conducted with people with visual impairments. First, I will explain how design causes disability. After that, I‚Äôll go over what designers can do to improve the user experience for people with visual impairments, and finally, suggest small improvements to the design process that can help designers better understand the reality of living with impairments.', 'This post doesn‚Äôt aim to just raise awareness among designers of considering people with disabilities. In addition to that, I want to highlight that people with impairments can offer invaluable insights that help us innovate our digital landscape. By embracing their restrictions, we can build more robust products, thus reducing annoyance for people who experience situational disabilities and exclusion for people with bodily impairments. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this post is to provide some thoughts on how design can reduce disability.', 'Digital products enable the user to choose their preferred way of accessing content. In contrast to physical products like books or other printed media, digital technology gives us the freedom to adjust text size and contrast. Moreover, assistive tools like screen readers can convert text and other structured content to speech. These functionalities allow everyone to alter the visual appearance of a website without changing its content. Features that ease the browsing experience for many users also enable people with impairments to independently access digital content.', 'Based on five interviews I conducted with people with visual impairments in conjunction with my Master‚Äôs thesis, I have discerned three topics that affect the experienced accessibility of a service:', 'These three factors influence whether people with visual impairments can enjoy the same browsing experiences as people without impairments.', 'In the words of one interviewee: ‚ÄúWhen a website is working fine, you forget that you are using a screen reader.‚Äù In this case, the interviewee had access to and sufficient knowledge of assistive technology. This knowledge, in combination with a well-functioning website, decreased his experience of disability.', 'On the other hand, when ‚Äúyou want to send a form and have to fill a CAPTCHA before sending it; then you get very disappointed and are reminded that you are blind‚Äù. (CAPTCHA is a type of text input task that requires a user to successfully interpret and type in a distorted word from an adjacent image, in order to prevent spam and other bot-assisted misuse. They have been criticized for being prohibitively difficult to use from an accessibility point of view.) Such website accessibility flaws reinforce the experience of disability for the user and exclude people with impairments from using the service.', 'In short, the experience of disability is reduced with access to and knowledge of assistive technology in combination with a sufficiently accessible website. In contrast, if a website doesn‚Äôt offer sufficient accessibility, design may increase or sometimes even cause disability. In the given example, the experienced disability was reinforced by a CAPTCHA ‚Äì a prime example of what Alison Adam and David Kreps (1) meant as they proposed that ‚Äúpoorly designed websites could be regarded as creating disability‚Äù. Design has the power to create disability because design plays such a vital role in the personal experience of accessibility.', 'If design creates disability, how can designers and other project stakeholders prevent this exclusion while improving the user experience for everyone?', 'First of all, it is important to note that universal accessibility is, most likely, unachievable. We might never see a website that is equally easy for all internet users to access. Instead, designers should discern the case-specific disabling factors for each project. This can be achieved by asking questions: Does a product rely on visual content? Will it require people to read long texts? Does it have audio-based content? Is it going to feature motion graphics or moving images? Based on these answers, designers can then discern the people who are most likely to be excluded from using the service.', 'In my thesis case, I focused on ways to substitute visual content to improve accessibility for people with visual impairments. That definition already includes a wide range of people, starting from people with colorblindness or low vision, to progressive loss of sight, or blindness. Nevertheless, by speaking with five people in various stages of visual impairment, I discerned nine design-related challenges to improve their browsing experience, accompanied with positive example cases from their daily internet usage:', '1. Consistent use of headlines', 'Screen reader users often access the content of a page through its headings. Thus, consistent use of heading tags, starting from H1, will help screen reader users quickly find the content they are looking for without having to listen to all elements on a website.', 'Good example mentioned in the interviews: Wikipedia', '2. Consistent layout on all pages and subpages', 'Finding your bearings on a website is far more difficult without the aid of visual cues. If the structure of the website changes on subsequent pages, users will have to re-establish their orientation ‚Äì which is even more difficult for people with visual impairments.', 'Good example mentioned in the interviews: Wikipedia', '3. Differentiation between content and function', 'When the functional parts of a website ‚Äì for example, navigational elements ‚Äì are separated from the content, people using screen readers can skip ahead to the content faster, and people using screen magnification can focus their view on the content section.', 'Good example mentioned in the interviews: Verkkokauppa.com or Facebook', '4. Predictable behaviour', 'Unexpected transitions on a website are liable to cause confusion for people with visual impairments. Such transitions include menus that open by merely hovering over an icon with the cursor, or predicting search results before the user has finished typing. Enabling people to confirm their action ‚Äì for example, to remove an item from a shopping cart ‚Äì will help users stay in control of their interaction with the website.', 'Good example mentioned in the interviews: Urjalan makeistukku.\nAn international example: Topshop', '5. Placing elements in intuitive locations', 'Following common design patterns for placing elements on a website helps people with visual impairments find items, such as the search functionality or language settings, based on their previous experience.', 'Good example mentioned in the interviews: The iOS back button is always located in the top left corner.', '6. Layout Jumps', 'Navigating back to a page after browsing a subpage should lead the user to the same position where they previously left off. When a site changes its scroll position after confirming a dialog option, for example, users will need to reorient themselves to find their previous location. Especially for people with visual impairments, this ‚Äújumping‚Äù behaviour leads to confusion and frustration.', '7. Amount of information on a site', 'Partially sighted people cannot skim texts. Consequently, reading will take them more time and effort than it does for sighted users. A large number of unnecessarily elaborate titles is particularly tiring, especially when the length of the title is irrelevant to understanding its content.', '8. Search', 'To prevent having to listen to the entire content of a website, people with visual impairments often rely on its search functionality. Additional filters to refine and sort search results would give them faster access to the requested content.', 'Good example mentioned in the interviews: Zalando', 'The issues raised in the interviews reflect the design requirements listed in the WCAG, but it is important to note that accessibility does not end with a usable website. A poorly designed service can cause mistrust towards the service if malfunction reports by people with impairments are not taken seriously by customer support. Moreover, when updates reduce the accessibility of a website, people start to mistrust the ability of the service provider to provide an inclusive user experience. Also, having to rely on visual content without sufficient descriptions is likely to make people with visual impairments feel ignored by the service.', 'In other words, a website can end up causing mistrust even if it addresses the abovementioned design challenges. For example, this could mean pushing people with impairments to use a specific accessible version or section of a website, preventing users from filtering search results, or ignoring reported issues from people with impairments. Consequently, designers and other stakeholders have to consider the entire service environment to ensure an inclusive user experience.', 'The entire product team is responsible for building an inclusive product, but it is the responsibility of designers specifically to consider the variability of the users. While it is impossible to design for everyone, preventing exclusion for the people most likely to be affected by it prevents design exclusion and, by extension, yields a more robust and versatile product.', 'In most design processes, designers focus on an average user derived from the majority of people anticipated to use a product. As a result, designers tend to get surprised when they see a website used at 200% magnification, using inverted colours, or spoken through a screen reader. In order to build inclusive products and services, we have to unlearn the ableist view, and forget the notion of the able-bodied user as the average or ‚Äúnormal‚Äù audience of any product or service. Designers should not assume digital content to be consumed in one specific way or appearance. Instead, they should focus on maintaining the same richness of information when using assistive technology.', 'To help designers empathise with people with impairments and better understand their browsing experience, one interviewee suggested a mouseless day. As many people with impairments ‚Äì such as those with severe visual impairments ‚Äì cannot use a mouse, a website has to be fully functional through the keyboard. By only using a keyboard to browse the internet, designers learn the impact of the tedious limitations many websites impose on people with impairments.', 'In conclusion, interaction with people with disabilities should not be encouraged merely to validate the usability of a service, but to drive innovation. By substituting the visual world through their hearing, people with visual impairments are experts in a field that technological advancements are only beginning to discover. Therefore, people with disabilities are experts by experience, and invaluable collaborators for building innovative products and services.']","['The devices and assistive technology used by a person;', 'A person‚Äôs knowledge of operating these assistive devices; and', 'The level of accessibility of a service or website.', 'Adam, A., & Kreps, D.

https://futurice.com/blog/interview-with-mobility-expert-valentin-jahn-car2ad,"Interview with Mobility Expert Valentin Jahn, CAR2AD ",20 May 2020,Opinion,"It is not about creating the next new hyped means of transport, but about really understanding what your user needs.",[],"['Valentin Jahn worked over 10 years as consultant and futurologist in the intersection of digital mobility. As Founder and CEO of CAR2AD, he combines digital business models with traditional mobility providers and shares his take on the future of urban mobility with us in this interview.\n', 'Looking at ongoing changes in urban mobility, what are the biggest trends and needs you are observing?', 'If we are looking at the current mobility landscape, we are facing two big developments: an increasing variety of transport modes on one hand and the Corona situation resulting in a shrinking use of public transport on the other hand. Especially looking at the second, it is now more than ever key to closely look at how to prevent a renaissance of MiV (motorized individual traffic) in cities. Therefore, I feel like it is an absolute necessity to look at the actual needs of the users, not just developing the next brand-new means of transport. We need to understand the reasons why a user is travelling, which criteria support the decision for a specific means of transport or how one simply wants to reach a certain destination?', 'Nevertheless, when looking at the ongoing innovation in mobility, I think we have been a bit stuck in the last 15 years. To really push innovation nowadays, we need to engage better with authorities. We will need to make it easier to understand new mobility concepts and create a more decision-friendly environment for them. During the Corona crisis, many mobility decisions were taken much faster and less bureaucraticly than usual, e.g. a lot of new bike lines were installed in Berlin without over-engineering the decision process. We should work on options on how to keep this development in our decision taking process alive.', 'Talking about Car2Ad, which role is your company playing in the latest developments of the urban mobility ecosystem?', 'Very concrete, we currently helped the German authorities to understand the travel behavior of passers-by. In a BMVI founded project for example, we were counting streams of passers-by.', 'Overall, we work on helping to close the financial gap of parking time for car sharing vehicles. We are facing a situation where cities need money for the parking fees while having the willingness to support car sharing at the same time. This creates conflicts that we are able to convert into a positive solution for both parties. Our approach helps cities earn their fees and collect data and information. Meanwhile, carsharing providers are enabled to pay their bills, optimize their business with our data and drive it in a positive and profitable direction. With our approach, we thrive to connect two worlds via technology and data: the needs of our cities and those of the carsharing providers.', 'Where do you personally see the biggest opportunities around urban mobility?', 'Looking at urban mobility, I see the biggest opportunity in the urban space itself. Our urban way of moving is highly connected to our living and recovering space, our gardening and work space. We discover a lot of spaces and opportunities that are currently unused. \nA lot of urban space is currently used, but not really in a thought-through manner. For example, a lot of cities don‚Äôt even know how many parking spaces they have, what their size is or how frequented they are. We experience a lack of parking spaces while we actually have a very evolved network of urban transport with free capacities. I think that thoroughly understanding these intermodal connections and the actual user needs will provide a big bucket of new opportunities.', 'Your business model is based on data. Which regulations do you see as necessary and which ones as hindering?', 'Our business model is focused on the parking time and the surrounding area of the\nparked car. When we get in direct contact with the customer via our CAR2AD Hotspot, a user permission is needed to handle or forward data for every action. Once users agree, we have different possible incentives. One of them is a special voucher relevant to surroundings and needs. \nTherefore the trust of our users is always at the core of our activities. A user never needs to share all information at once, but only the data that brings him the expected value and benefit.', 'Looking at data, what is required in the future to leverage its full potential? Which opportunities do you see?', 'If I imagine that I am a mobility provider, it is necessary to become a need fulfiller. That means it is crucial to understand the reason why the user (yes, I say user instead of customer) drove to a certain destination. You can for example suggest to him via an intelligent navigation system what the fastest route to an Italian restaurant is, or you might be able to use other POI (Point of Interest) data such as opening times or information about the surrounding area. Only when understanding the needs of your users, you will be able to develop a business model that actually brings value to them and revenue to you. If I therefore see one specific opportunity, I would say it is understanding the user and not simply offering him the next new means of transport.', 'How can you ensure cities are not getting locked into platforms when buying tech from MaaS providers?', 'At first, I would be very happy if cities used technology and MaaS already more than they currently do. Looking at cities right now, they still don‚Äôt even know how many parking lots there are or what their assets in street infrastructure are. This definitely needs to change, before we can talk about a bigger shift in urban mobility.', 'Looking into the future, where do you think we can expect the biggest shifts in mobility?', 'I don‚Äôt want to sound too pessimistic, but when you look back at the pioneers and\ninventors from 100 years ago, where the giant shifts in mobility happened, the first very big ideas in mobility were created from scratch and new technologies evolved almost in a start-up manner. I feel like we are a bit stuck today.\nWe are generally facing times with no major crises and no need to radically reinvent our mobility. But being confronted with a big health and economical crisis right now, my hope is that this could actually encourage the mobility companies to innovate, to cooperate and to really focus on what the user needs.', 'How do companies need to adapt for these changes?', 'I think, to stay relevant in the future, we need an interplay and an intersection of business models - or should we even say industries? For car users and other means of transport, we clearly need to focus on finding how we can provide value, who would pay for what and where responsibilities lie. Only if we find these intersections we can develop successful new business models that also mitigate potential risks.', 'About Valentin Jahn', '', 'Valentin Jahn worked over 10 years as consultant and futurologist in the intersection of digital mobility. Since the early beginnings of app-based mobility solutions, he jumps in this disrupting topic and invented many solutions for the mobility industry. As Founder and CEO of CAR2AD, he combines digital business models with traditional mobility providers.

For instance, we can write a selector returning the money amount after currency conversion, building on the basic selectors we defined before:"", 'Assuming this is a React app, we can now use these selectors from a component with React Redux:', 'We could have put all the state access and currency conversion code into ConversionResultView directly. Extracting it into standalone selectors has several benefits, however.', ""When using a selector, the caller does not need to know how the Redux state is shaped or which of its data is needed by the selector; it simply passes the state as a whole and gets back the desired value. No matter whether this value comes directly from the state or is computed on the fly, the call is the same. This means that if the state's structure changes, only the selectors themselves need to be updated; their callers are unaffected. Said another way, selectors minimize the coupling between the Redux store and its consumers."", 'Once written, a selector can be called from any piece of code with access to the Redux state. This includes not only UI components, but also other selectors: as each selector receives the Redux state as an argument, it has, by definition, all it needs to call any other selector. It is thus easy to reuse existing selectors to compose new ones.', 'Selectors are expected to be pure functions: given the same input, they always return the same result, without side effects. This makes them easy to reason about in isolation. It also makes them easy to unit-test: we just need to prepare an input state, call the selector, and compare the return value with what we except, like in the following example (using Jest):', ""Purity also enables memoization: because we know that a selector's return value will only change if its input - that is, the Redux state - changes, we can avoid recomputing the same value by caching it, only doing a new computation if the passed state is different from the previous one."", 'The Reselect library is a well-known implementation of this idea. Using it, we could have written the selectConvertedAmount selector as follows:', '(Even though I recommend using Reselect for all but the most basic selectors, I won‚Äôt use it for the rest of this post to keep things simple.)', ""So far, we have seen that Redux selectors can abstract away the state's shape and avoid redundant computations. But there's more."", 'To see the full potential of selectors, it helps to reflect on what it means to call one. Intuitively, we might think of it as just fetching or computing a value from the state. However, I realized that it‚Äôs much more helpful to see it as asking a question, answered by the selector based on the ""facts"" (state and rules) of the application‚Äôs world.', 'For instance, when ConversionResultView uses selectConvertedAmount in the example above, it basically asks: ""What is the current result of the currency conversion (given the user‚Äôs inputs)?"" Note that the caller doesn‚Äôt even need to know which pieces of information are required to answer the question - all the know-how is in the selector, which just gets what it needs from the application state itself, either by looking it up directly or by asking other selectors.', ""Seen this way, selectors are like little domain experts for your app, specialized on answering a single question about your app's world, and collaborating with other selectors as needed."", 'This means that whenever we can frame a piece of app logic as a state-dependent question, we can express the answer as a selector, giving us all of the mentioned encapsulation, reusability, testing and optimization benefits. The following sections highlight some example use cases that illustrate this.', 'Validating user inputs is, basically, the act of asking: ""Do the user\'s inputs make sense (given the application\'s rules)?"" This makes validation logic a great match for selectors, as long as you save the data to validate in the Redux state.', 'For instance, imagine an app for ordering food from a restaurant. The user can only place an order if the order sum is above a particular minimum amount. If we store the currently selected order items in Redux, we can easily write a selector for this rule:', ""This approach scales nicely as the logic becomes more complex. If, for instance, it is later decided that drinks and desserts shouldn't count towards the minimum amount, we can do this change locally in the selector without affecting any of its users."", 'Selectors are great for processing collections of items using arbitrarily complex rules. For instance, to answer the question ""Which tasks have all of the tags selected by the user?"", we can write a selector like the following:', 'As new kinds of filters get added, selectFilteredTasks can be extended to take these into account as well, keeping the rest of the codebase unchanged. Sorting can be handled the same way.', ""We can also do other types of aggregations using selectors. For example, when writing an online quiz app, a selector for calculating the user's current score could look like this:"", 'Many apps integrate side effects into the Redux flow using thunks, sagas, epics, or similar abstractions. In some cases, especially complex ones, these need to consult the application state to determine which operations to perform or which parameters to pass to them.', 'Instead of mixing this logic with the side effects (which are usually tedious to test because they require mocking the actual effects), we can extract it into selectors, making the actual side effect code as lean as possible. All of the popular side effect libraries have an easy way to do this; for instance, Redux Saga offers the select effect, which helps us simplify sagas as in the following example:', 'This makes it easy to test most of the logic independently of the saga, for which we just need to check whether the value returned by the select is correctly forwarded to the navigateToStep effect:', 'While Redux selectors can do many things, they cannot do all things.', ""Firstly, selectors only have access to state that is in the Redux store, so their power is limited by how much of the app's state is kept in Redux. They are less useful for apps that use Redux only for small bits of state, for instance because most data is fetched and managed using a GraphQL library. One way to mitigate this problem is to add extra parameters to selectors, allowing non-Redux state to be passed, but that reduces uniformity (making selector composition more difficult) and makes memoization more difficult. Another is to write selector factories, which take all required non-Redux data and return a selector as a result:"", ""Secondly, selectors are pure and synchronous, so they cannot consult external sources such as backend APIs. For cases where this is needed, Redux side effect abstractions like sagas are a better fit. Even then, you can still choose to extract the pure parts of the logic into selectors, as we've seen before."", 'Lastly, with selectors we can only express ""static"" logic that depends only on the current application state. For ""dynamic"" logic that is based on events ‚Äì state machines, for example ‚Äì Redux offers reducers.', 'Viewing Redux selectors as ""little domain experts"", answering the application\'s questions by consulting its state, reveals that they can do much more than just hiding the state\'s shape or caching values. We can use them for filtering and aggregating data, validating user inputs, making control flow decisions for side effects, and many other types of application logic. Because selectors are pure and uniform in how they are called, they make application logic easy to reason about, compose, reuse, and test.', ""This post was originally published on Denis Washington's personal blog.""]","['""Computing Derived Data"" (Redux docs)', 'Reselect']"

Two futuriceans ‚Äî Teemu Moisala (CEO) and Olli-Pekka Saksa (Global Head of Human Care) ‚Äî are sitting thoughtfully in our meeting room decorated with Legos in Helsinki.

But hey, let‚Äôs cut to the chase ‚Äî how have we approached OKRs so far here at Futurice?', 'First of all, as we‚Äôre focused on consulting (and we‚Äôre not a full-force product company), there are slightly different dynamics that affect the implementation: the majority of our employees are working most of their time together with our clients, following mainly the clients‚Äô goals. But we do have multiple ‚Äúnot client teams‚Äù with clear responsibilities (e.g. certain people in tribes, marketing, human care, IT etc.) where it makes sense to use something like OKRs. So currently (April 2020), we have approx. 120 (of ~600) employees directly involved.', 'Secondly (although there‚Äôs still a lot to do in this area), we‚Äôve approached the framework by acknowledging the need for two types of goals: OKRs and Health Metrics (in other words KPIs, Key Performance Indicators). With OKRs, we define what we need to actively push forward right now ‚Äî we set, track and grade clear quarterly and biannual/annual goals. With Health Metrics, we mean the certain chosen performance indicators that we always need to protect, things that keep us going (related to clients, people & numbers). If there‚Äôs an identified challenge with certain Health Metrics, we might need to react immediately, and it might end up within our OKRs for the next quarter.', 'Thirdly, after validating multiple possible scenarios, we decided to start with team-based OKRs. There are organizations (like Google) where many employees are writing down their individual OKRs. In our context, the team-based approach (to our knowledge, also Zalando‚Äôs approach to OKRs) seemed like the best fit.', 'Fourthly, we‚Äôre currently deriving our company-wide OKRs biannually (possibly moving to annually) from our strategy. All other, like countries‚Äô, global and local teams‚Äô OKRs, are currently following a quarterly cycle. So our ""not client teams"" set goals for themselves every three months, track their progress transparently on a weekly/biweekly basis (depending on the team) and have a retrospective minimum once a quarter to grade the results and learn from the past time box. ‚Ü∫', '', 'Of course!

And here we are, writing this blogpost, to share with you our journey & insights so far.', '', 'Yes. Here you go:', '1. Especially if you‚Äôre a first-timer with OKRs, it‚Äôs important to start by understanding and acknowledging what your organization‚Äôs current & desired leadership culture is like. How does it differ across the organization, e.g. in different countries and offices? Based on those realizations, craft scenarios of the potential approach to OKRs and its implementation. Be honest: what‚Äôs the current level of psychological safety ‚Äî do your employees trust each other ‚Äî or fall easily into micromanaging? How about people‚Äôs experience on the level of transparency and equality? A successful company-wide implementation of OKRs framework requires a healthy foundation in the forementioned. Nevertheless, don‚Äôt get stuck with your organization‚Äôs current challenges ‚Äî but go and start experimenting ‚Äî as OKRs implementation might serve you as a tool for contributing in improving those basic fundamentals of collaboration.', '2. Find a ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù from your top leadership, select torchbearer(s) and ensure that at least the majority of recognized key players are committed to experiment. An organization-wide implementation of OKRs approach requires investments and mental capacity especially from the leaders. Without these, you‚Äôll likely end up with lip service. Require enough understanding and experience of business from the torchbearer(s), to integrate the OKRs as a natural continuum to your strategy process. It‚Äôs good to note here that even a small individual team might find OKRs useful in guiding the daily focus, but the real value comes from when you learn to use it to improve the alignment & focus of the whole ship.', ""3. Recognize that it‚Äôs a learning journey, not a quick sprint. Implementing OKRs will most likely require a change in the way you lead yourself and the organization. It‚Äôs about finding a sweet balance between autonomy and alignment. Requiring the goals to be clear and inspiring, but also measurable and transparent for everyone. It's about enabling everyone to make their voice heard. Instead of micromanaging initiatives ‚Äî or being in complete darkness with the status of things ‚Äî it requires trusting people to make smart decisions on what tasks to do to get to your company‚Äôs goals. We‚Äôve been on the journey for over a year now ‚Äî and by no means can we claim that we‚Äôre ‚Äúready‚Äù yet ‚Äî but hey, at least we are learning, continuously! :)"", '4. Communicate the WHY actively, starting from the beginning. Make transparent and accept the challenge your organization is aiming to improve / fix with implementing the OKRs approach. Clarify the answer from both perspectives: ‚ÄúWhy are we doing this?‚Äù (organization) and ‚ÄúWhy should I care?‚Äù (individual). Then remember to repeat it. This‚Äôll help you in getting the buy-in from the leaders. It‚Äôs easier to start experimenting and continue to full-scale implementation, when the problem worth solving is identified, validated, accepted and communicated transparently.', '5. Use a mixture of communication channels and invest in a proper OKRs tool. Back in the 1970s, Andy Grove & employees at Intel used to have their OKRs written down on sheets of paper, attached next to their desks. And in all its simplicity, it worked. Today, online communication is the default, but the required change communication might get lost in the endless stream of emails and Slack messages. At Futurice, we‚Äôve found it helpful to invest in a proper SaaS tool (started originally with Google Sheets, then shifted to Betterworks). In addition to the tool and continuous communications via our digital channels, we‚Äôve used old-school printed OKRs canvases in our premises, infoscreens with real-time data, all-hands meetings etc. One can always improve communications!', '6.  When setting OKRs, you need to make hard choices on what things you don‚Äôt do now. Make it clear ‚Äî what is going to be left to the backlog and why ‚Äî and then make the backlog transparent. The OKRs setting should lead to tough and even uncomfortable prioritisation discussions: people tend to feel their plates are already full or things that are both urgent and important. Amazon‚Äôs ‚Äúdisagree and commit‚Äù is often a good principle, when your team has too contrasting opinions on what things should be a top priority.', '7. Avoid framing Objectives as generic headlines under which you bundle various loosely related metrics. In our approach, we believe your Objectives should be inspiring, time-bound, strategic changes you aim to prioritise. Key Results are different means to make that strategic change measurable. (Our 9-step criteria for Objectives: 1. Directional, 2. Aligned, 3. Challenging, 4. Within your circle of influence, 5. Time-bound, 6. Without numbers, 7. Limited, 8. Inspirational, 9. Easy to understand).', ""8. Optimally, Key Results should measure true outcomes, like the change of human behaviour (e.g. client, employee, stakeholder X). KRs shouldn‚Äôt measure initiatives A, B and C or outputs ‚Äî but the expected outcomes of those initiatives. Best KRs are simple and easy to measure. Though when measuring outcomes, it's natural that the results start realizing towards the end of your time box ‚Äî so it's important to discuss your teams' confidence levels for meeting the OKRs. If you can‚Äôt measure your KR, your follow up meetings easily become dull, fruitless and discouraging status update meetings. Shoddy follow ups often lead to lower success. Prioritize leading metrics over lagging metrics! (Our 8-step criteria for Key Results: 1. Guides you toward the objective, Measurable, 3. Outcome-based, 4. Balanced, 5. Ambitious, 6. Time-bound, 7. Limited, 8. Simple)"", '9. Don‚Äôt overestimate your team‚Äôs / organization‚Äôs ability to execute. In our case, we recommend our teams to choose max. 2-3 objectives with max. 8 KRs in total for the time box. Usually less is more.', '10. Use a negotiation approach ‚Äî both ‚Äúbottom up & top down‚Äù. Ensure enough alignment to the organization‚Äôs other relevant OKRs, but ensure motivation by empowering each team to add their own flavour. Help everyone to understand ‚Äúwhat good looks like‚Äù with clear company-wide OKRs, but try to avoid cascading initiatives / tasks ‚Äî trust your people to find the right ways to cross the river (referring to the Spotify‚Äôs picture above).', '11. We believe each set of OKRs should be owned by a clear team which meets regularly. And each Key Result (under each Objective) should have a named individual owner within the team (if the responsibility is unclear, it often ends up being neglected ‚Äî the same happens if all the KRs are de facto owned only by the ‚Äúteam lead‚Äù).

https://futurice.com/blog/from-bits-to-pieces-how-design-systems-improve-collaboration,From bits to pieces: How design systems improve collaboration,14 Apr 2020,Innovation & Design,"The benefits of design systems how to improve collaboration between designers, developers and stakeholders are discussed","['Collecting the bits', 'Building pieces', 'Keeping the pieces together', 'From pieces to value creation']","['For a design system to do its job properly, every stakeholder of the service needs to utilise, update and understand it. Otherwise, designers will work in their bubble of ideal elements wrapped in a perfect system ‚Äî while the actual website will look completely different.', 'Large digital services with a variety of content running on multiple platforms often risk having an inconsistent visual appearance. This is partly because parts of the service were built at different times by different people, and partly because design decisions get lost along the path from the initial idea to the final implementation. Consequently, parts of a service can look different depending on when they were built or where they appear. To solve this problem, design teams rely on design systems.', 'Ideally, a design system will help create a consistent visual appearance by breaking interface components down into their smallest elements, which are then reused in multiple components and contexts. For example, on a news page, a teaser component, displaying a piece of news will consist of a headline, image, introductory sentence, and a bookmarking icon. From this element, the font family and spacing, can be reused e.g. for displaying the same news item in a list of recommendations. Moreover, all elements of this teaser component will have margins or paddings which can be reused for spacing similar elements elsewhere on the page. New components can then be built based on these smallest elements.', 'Moreover, once an element is changed, all components that use the same elements are automatically updated. In other words, when we change the colour of a bookmarking icon in the teaser, every component that uses the same icon will change its colour. Thereby, designers and developers can ensure a consistent visual appearance across all applications and websites of a service.', 'But for a design system to do its job properly, every stakeholder of the service needs to utilise, update and understand it. Otherwise, designers will work in their bubble of ideal elements wrapped in a perfect system ‚Äî while the actual website will look completely different.', 'In this blog post, I will explain the process we used to integrate a design system into our ways of working at Finland‚Äôs largest tabloid newspaper, Ilta-Sanomat.', 'As we set out to implement a design system, Ilta-Sanomat had three style guides in use. One was the style guide used for the last website renewal, the second contained groups of selected layouts, and the third comprised a small library of interface components as reusable symbols. Essentially, these guides mostly just catalogued past versions of the future, because the design and development process was out of sync.', 'In contrast to the latest interface component library, the inspection of the website revealed hundreds of different shades of grey or red, as well as a multitude of font sizes, font colours and background colours. The missing link between the design library and the coded styles resulted in this ambivalence of the design library and the final website.', '\nBackground colors defined in the CSS of the website', 'The problem lay in the process. Once designers finished a new component, they added it to the current design library and moved on to the next issue. Meanwhile, the new component would become a ticket in the development backlog. After developers had resolved the ticket, the final implementation was released without further discussion with the original designer. As the designers followed their style guides and the developers followed pre-existing styles from the CSS, the result did not reflect the initial design. Consequently, for every new element or layout, we had to decide whether we wanted to be consistent with other parts of the website, or continue with the improved design.', '\nThe initial design and development process', 'When working on a large website, designers and developers tend to focus on the parts they are currently working on. But a website is more than just a list of components ‚Äì a user perceives a website as a single unit by moving and scrolling through its pages. Therefore, the website should be designed and built as one entity.', 'To better account for this, I printed the entire website on a long strip of paper. Seeing a website in one piece instead of one screen at a time enables us to discern any inconsistencies, e.g. in headline sizes or colours. Afterwards, I placed cutouts of the elements from the print on a piece of paper. This overview became our first design system, which was based on the actual components of the site.', '\nThe first design system on paper', 'In the subsequent design renewal process, we re-evaluated all elements on the front page of the website. During this process, we printed more websites to discern design patterns and best practices. And finally, after a two-week design sprint, we started to define the design system.', 'To build the system, we applied and extended the components we had developed during the sprint on all other pages, such as article pages and section pages.', 'Parallel to the design renewal, we evaluated methods to link the design and development processes. We settled on Storybook as a tool to display individual components as they appear on the website, and Abstract for version control of the design system. Similarly to other design systems, we defined common styles, such as font sizes, margins and colours, components like buttons and the search bar, as well as sample layouts for site-specific components like lists and teasers. Together with the development team, we documented all these styles and components both in Abstract and Storybook. Through this collaboration, we ensured that developers understood the logic of the design styles, and that designers were aware of the components defined in Storybook.', 'After this collaborative process, both developers and designers could actively collaborate in the creation of components. For example, when designers applied an incorrect font size, developers would ask why we had diverged from the agreed type scale, instead of defining the mistake as an exception to the rule.', 'Design systems only work when all stakeholders are committed to using them. I already explained the pains of working with a design library that differs from the styles of the website, and the same risk persists with design systems. Even when components are documented and new elements follow defined styles, everyday reality can disrupt the system. To prevent this pitfall, we introduced a ‚Äúdesign review‚Äù phase into the development process. In practice, this means that developers and designers have to talk before publishing a design-related issue on the website.', 'Additionally, we included our design tasks to the same issue tracking environment on Jira that the developers were already using. And during the design process, we started to differentiate between a master design system project and work-in-progress files. Per the new process, designers will only update the master file after both designers and developers have approved the final implementation. Through these three steps, we ensured the design system stays up-to-date and in sync with the final elements in the Storybook.', '\nThe new design process', 'From my experience, a successful design system does not depend on its structure or the tools used to maintain it. What matters most is that designers and developers speak the same language. When designers talk about captions, list entries, brand colours, and headlines, the developers understand the reference. In return, designers understand that technically not all lists are lists just because they look the same.', 'There are many benefits in documenting styles, elements and components into a reusable system that is accessible to all stakeholders. But in our case, the design system first and foremost improved collaboration across disciplines inside the entire team. Thanks to this process, the development team can now implement new features and changes faster than before, because every component uses predefined styles. And on the other hand, the design team can focus on creating the best possible experience for every user instead of running after broken font styles caused by lack of communication.', '\nThe new Ilta-Sanomat front page']",[]

The next job is to delegate work to external serverless microservices for implementation. The challenge is doing so *reliably*, with at-least-once delivery semantics, in an event driven manner.', 'Interesting, Camunda discourages the event driven push approach, and instead recommends external tasks pull from the workflow engine. Pull, however, does not follow the grain of modern event driven serverless architecture.

It's more secure. It's easier to operate."", ""Pull based external tasks are against the grain of FaaS's event driven architecture. Camunda recommends that external tasks periodically pull for work.

The main challenge is delivering messages reliably, i.e. at-least-once delivery mechanics.

I also understood the importance of culture and why in my previous roles I could never hire the kind of personalities that I worked with on a startup environment. Unfortunately, I couldn't secure livelihood solely on it, so I joined an ICT outsourcing provider as their COO, and in late 2019 I started as the Global head of Data and IT at Futurice."", 'The few months here at Futurice has been some of the most fulfilling in my life. I have understood that it IS possible to scale up the best parts of startup culture, and with the resources of a larger company, build on top of that even further. All it really needs are the right values and the courage from the management and owners to follow through. I am still right at the start of my journey here, but I can already see that in this kind of environment, my best abilities are being enhanced, and my impact can therefore be even bigger than I originally thought. I don‚Äôt necessarily know exactly how my plans come to together and what I get to deliver in a years time, but in an environment like this I can allow myself to dream big, so in any case, it will be something AWESOME!', 'Lesson learnt #3: Don‚Äôt settle. Know what good looks like, and keep on looking for that until you find it, or you find something you can turn into it yourself.', 'I am myself very proud of my career and my achievements in technology. I have grown from a complete novice to a very technically capable Systems Administrator, to project manager leading complex programs, to an executive and a leader with global corporate impact. When I reflect on my journey, I find a few key topics that I believe have been key for my success:', '1. The path to your goals will reveal itself during the journey. On my very first day of IT work I was tasked to unbox a Compaq Proliant server, install Server OS and MS Exchange on it, and make it a domain controller as part of global network. I had never seen a server before and had no idea that this was actually a very complex task even for an experienced professional. This has become somewhat of an underpinning theme on my career; been thrown ‚Äúto the deep end‚Äù and me learning to swim -eventually. I have had the opportunity to plan and execute global projects where I have had no idea how to deliver the outcomes. The key learning here is that I have understood that best things are hard to reach, and that the road there is never fully visible at start. You should still take the first step - the path to your goals will reveal itself during your journey if you just believe in it, and work hard to get there.', '2. There are no successful ‚Äúself-made‚Äù people. All success is the result of a group of people working together and supporting each other‚Äôs efforts. It may be you in the spotlight and leading, but you are there and being supported by your family, friends, mentors, superiors past and present, all the teachers, clients, partners, your teams and your colleagues. Whether you realize it yourself or not, your achievements are not just yours, and your success will always rely on other people. So treat any person who has any impact in your life well, they are a part of what made you and deserve your utmost respect and the best you have to give.', '3. Raise your hand. This skill is deceptively easy in theory, but in reality, one of the hardest, and arguably the most important skill you will ever gain. People cannot read minds. If you think you will get that open position or promotion or the interesting project just because you want and deserve it too, think again. Most likely, the person making the selection has no idea you would be interested in it, and if you don‚Äôt raise your hands, it will probably go to someone else. But if you do, good things can happen. This skill requires confidence and the readiness to put yourself under scrutiny, so work on those first.', '4. Whether you think you can, or you think you can‚Äôt, you‚Äôre probably right. No one can see into the future, and experience does not give you knowledge of something you encounter for the first time. I have come to accept that I am not alone in feeling that I have no clue how to do something when facing new situations (daily!). Even the most experienced MD‚Äôs and corporate board members are totally clueless what to do, or how to fix things when seeing them the first time. That‚Äôs normal. What the very senior people understand is, that action to any direction is better than no direction at all. So, they choose the first move based on their experience, and yes, their gut feeling. They also understand that if the first chosen direction turns out to be bad, they can and will change direction. Remember this. If you think you can‚Äôt do it, you‚Äôre right. If you think you can, even when you don‚Äôt know how, try one thing, and if that doesn‚Äôt work, try another. That‚Äôs the only way to get experience. And you will probably find that you were right.', '5. No matter your gender, your view is unique and it‚Äôs your greatest asset. Every person is an individual, everyone has a slightly different view of the world. Because of this, you are the only person who can bring your view to the discussion. Do not hide or shy your view away because of some external attribute like being born female, or an internal one like being an introvert personality. Every single discussion, every single decision, every single outcome is better when it is done by a diverse group of individuals.']",[]

People and goods move within an intricate network, served by mobility providers with different services and transportation methods. In an effort to meet evolving user needs in a changing environment, the amount and breadth of mobility services offered in cities have changed in profound ways and grown considerably over the last twenty years. One of the main driving forces has been the desire by established mobility providers to extend their offering with services that complement their traditional core offering. Often they‚Äôve done this by trying to create their own proprietary ecosystems with the aim of extracting maximum value from their company assets in a digital economy. They were not looking at the bigger picture.', 'This approach has failed to integrate services into an efficient urban mobility ecosystem.', 'The end result is a rich variety of mobility services that are, as a whole, poorly integrated into the urban context and hard to manage. In other words, they fail to meet user expectations and are often prohibitively costly to maintain. Bottlenecks in providing users with the services they really need include the number of players in a particular market, the complexity of technically integrating their services and difficulties in finding business models that offer benefits for all service providers.', 'The market is currently quite turbulent. Car sharing provider ShareNow was recently in the headlines with their decision to step back from a number of markets, including the potentially lucrative and important United States. The less-regulated American market with its constant inflow of competition in the form of mobility startups and high costs of maintaining car fleets in major cities proved untenable in the long run.', 'The inability of ShareNow to break into the US market should not make us question whether the transformation of urban mobility is proceeding as quickly as expected. The important questions are related to roles in the interaction between different service providers: Who is the orchestrator? Who are the players? These questions have yet to be answered and the playing field is still open to a degree, but for how long? Traditional car companies have experienced difficulties in finding their roles in the new ecosystem. They‚Äôve also had a hard time extracting value from the data they‚Äôve collected over the preceding years and decades.', 'So what‚Äôs happening with ShareNow should not be seen as an indication of a retreat from the new urban mobility market or the sharing economy - it‚Äôs a welcome change in how to approach providing urban mobility and the role carmakers are best suited to play. Investment in technologies like ‚Äúdigital key‚Äù speaks of trust in the continued growth of the sharing economy and a desire to integrate the car into a larger mobility ecosystem. This also signals a willingness to step back from the idea of owning the mobility ecosystems as orchestrators and, instead, becoming important players. This role still offers them an opportunity to make the most out of assets like sensors, collected mobility data and the car as a device for additional service opportunities.', 'If companies that have dominated the personal mobility field for a hundred years are starting to find their footing as players in the urban mobility ecosystem, who will be the owner? The answer is: we don‚Äôt know. And while that is an interesting and provocative question to ask, it‚Äôs not the most important one we are currently facing.', 'The question we need to focus on is what the success criteria are for an urban mobility ecosystem. As we‚Äôve seen, attempts by a wide variety of mobility providers - ranging from carmakers to startups to public transportation companies - to build their own ecosystems to make the most out of their assets were not particularly successful. The fundamental problem with the approach was to look at it from the perspective of assets like data or equipment, instead of approaching it from the user needs perspective.', 'Customers love convenience. They want an integrated mobility offering that is easy to access, use and pay for.', 'The only way to provide the level of service and convenience customers want is to focus on user needs and work together with other players in urban mobility. No one can do it by focusing on their assets and no one can do it alone.', 'An efficient and integrated ecosystem offers numerous benefits for players as well as orchestrators. Players gain access to a wide range of users for their services, with reduced investment and risk. Ecosystem owners potentially have more revenue generation opportunities and they definitely wield more strategic power, but they also face higher costs and risks in ecosystem maintenance.', 'The future urban mobility ecosystem we build through cooperation will be one that delivers real value to customers.', 'You don‚Äôt have to own the game to win the race.', 'You would like to dig deeper and learn more about the interplay of data and innovation?

Not anymore. What happened? The world is changing fast and there are many alternatives to car ownership. Mobility has become the heart of the matter - not the car.,['What happened?'],"['As long as I can remember, I‚Äôve been fascinated by cars. My love of cars runs deep and wide. I‚Äôve never been particularly picky. As a child growing up in eastern Europe, I loved cars of all kinds and wanted to be a car designer. Money was really the only thing holding me back. There was no way I could afford even the cheapest practical automobile as a student. I‚Äôm now at a stage in life where owning a decent car is, for the first time, a realistic option and I‚Äôm struggling with the idea.', 'I think it‚Äôs a combination of two things: growing up to become more aware of the realities of car ownership and times changing in a way that offers lots more alternatives that provide access to mobility without having to own a car. Millennials are growing up in a different world and automotive companies need to adapt. Fast.', 'Car ownership is, of course, a highly subjective topic and whether or not it‚Äôs worth it depends on the needs and situation of each individual person or family. If my situation was different, if I had children or lived in a less densely populated area, I might feel differently, but I‚Äôm pretty sure my experience is representative of many other millennials living in bigger cities.', 'The ownership reality check I experienced mostly involved incredibly mundane stuff. Keeping a car is expensive and it sits idle most of the time. Traffic jams are something you don‚Äôt pay attention to as a child. As a grownup, you realize they are unavoidable and a huge time sink. Then there‚Äôs parking, which eats up money and time.', 'With age and as the world has changed, I‚Äôve come to feel that mobility is the heart of the matter - not the car.', 'If I set out to think about my needs in terms of getting from point A to point B, the world is changing fast and there are many alternatives to car ownership available now that I couldn‚Äôt have dreamed of even ten years ago. The alternatives are enabled by technology and the fact that millennials are not that attached to the idea of car ownership and much more likely to trust new services.', 'Uber, Lyft, and others offer a quick and cheap way to travel within the city. These disruptive services have also had an impact on the prices and digital service level offered by traditional taxi companies.', 'Subscription models may sound very strange at first, but if we are already using the model for everything from entertainment to software tools, why not cars? Car-sharing operates in a similar vein and here in Stuttgart, Reach Now is one of the most cost-effective solutions to getting around. Globally, car-sharing services that have entered the market over the last few years have not done as well as expected. It‚Äôs possible that they may turn out to be just a step towards future services that better answer the question of how to offer users freedom and convenient mobility while reducing the number of cars in cities.', 'At the rate things are changing in mobility right now, we can expect services we can‚Äôt even imagine right now in the near future.', 'A disclaimer: what I‚Äôve done here is write down the pros and cons of owning a car. The one thing I left out is the 5-year old inside me, whose passion for cars still burns bright. So, while buying a car right now would be a terrible idea, it doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt someday. The reasons will be different from what I imagined as a child. Odds are it will be more of a hobby, an object of desire, something to appreciate almost purely from an aesthetic perspective.', 'I‚Äôll love it, but I‚Äôll still rather use convenient and well-designed mobility services to get around in my everyday life. Maybe in the future, there will be a service that combines my need for easy access to mobility with my deep and abiding love for cars.', 'You would like to dig deeper and learn more about the changing mobility market?

https://futurice.com/blog/non-technical-skills-matter-for-a-data-scientist,Non-technical Skills Matter - my first year as a data scientist in a consultancy  ,4 Mar 2020,Technology,A look at how important non-technical skills are for a data scientist in a consultancy.,"['Proactive communication is your primary risk management tool', 'Aspire to be a trusted advisor to clients and colleagues alike', 'Look towards solving strategic business goals of the client to increase your impact', 'Recommended reading']","['__I joined Futurice, an innovation consultancy, as a data scientist approximately one year ago. Before the job interview, I worried mostly about having sufficient technical knowledge. They were hiring me for a technical position, so the things that should matter the most are my technical skills, right? As it turns out, not exactly. __', 'I knew that soft or non-technical skills mattered as well, but I was fairly confident I had that part covered. What I‚Äôve found in my first year at Futurice was that besides getting to use my technical know-how in various interesting and challenging projects, I had to step up and improve a lot in non-technical areas, especially those related to understanding the sales process, consultancy business, and how to communicate with customers and colleagues alike. My perception of what are the possibilities for impact as a data scientist broadened significantly.', 'These lessons are from my personal experiences, both positive (e.g. I was happy to discover that I could have a positive impact in a new surprising way) and negative (e.g. I wish I had handled this issue in a different way). Your mileage may vary:', 'I wanted to understand what it means to be a consultant. I wanted to understand the role of sales in our business. I read some books that are considered - at least based on Amazon reviews - essential on these topics. The books helped me clarify and distill the lessons I‚Äôve learned so far working as a data scientist in a consultancy company. I‚Äôve listed some of them at the end of this post. I would recommend reading those to anyone who is working in a consultancy in a technical role and aspires to work more closely with clients and business-oriented colleagues.', 'As cliched as it sounds, this has probably been my most valuable lesson. Usually, in a project, there is the technical and non-technical staff, with the latter being expected to take care of most non-technical issues. However, the data scientist still has the responsibility to proactively communicate about non-technical issues that might be blocking their work. Why is that? Data science projects are inherently riskier since there is more uncertainty involved in the outcome of the project. For example, you cannot know in advance whether the data that the client has will allow you to get the insights/solutions that your client expects. I strongly believe that data science projects should be handled from a risk management perspective. So it‚Äôs in the best interest of the data scientist to be vigilant about any non-technical risks that might affect their work and ultimately the success of the project. Most of those risks can be mitigated with proactive communication. Some examples:', 'As can be seen from these examples, communication skills are not just about polite conversation and cheerful disposition, but an essential tool to proactively remove obstacles to your work and minimise non-technical risks. Data scientists are responsible for recognising and mitigating both technical and non-technical risks in data science projects.', 'There is a lot of hype around AI and data science, and it seems to be spreading to almost all industries. This, in turn, means more data scientists get hired and the salaries are competitive. On the other hand, an understanding of what AI actually is and what can be done with it is somewhat lacking, especially among people with a non-technical background. This leads to unrealistic expectations and missed opportunities. The latter can be especially frustrating. For example, I bet that in every company that is just starting with AI and data, there are some low-hanging fruits - problems that can be solved with relatively simple data science methods and existing data - that would provide an excellent ROI and address some important business goals. You just need people to be able to identify them.', 'This is where an important aspect of being a data scientist comes in - your role as an advisor and educator to your colleagues and clients alike. You can start by simply showing a welcoming attitude to your colleagues, by letting them know that you are happy to help if they have questions about AI and data. You can support salespeople when they are preparing a proposal for a client to make sure that all the bases are covered or just be generous in accepting to participate in preliminary meetings with clients to help them explore their options.', 'There are a lot of opportunities to help out and make a difference, and you would be surprised how your non-technical work (‚Äúemotional labour‚Äù as Godin calls it) will allow you to learn more about your business and most likely have a positive impact on the bottom line of your company. \nOne of the most gratifying experiences I had last year was running our internal AI crash course. The goal of the course is to establish a base level of understanding about AI and data science within our company, and give people from different competences the insights that are relevant to their work. It was an interesting challenge since I wanted to make sure that everyone felt that they got something useful out of it. AI and data are complicated topics that have an impact on almost everyone‚Äôs work. As an expert on the topic, you can make a difference in people‚Äôs lives by helping them understand, which in turn will make you a valued colleague (or advisor to the client) whom they feel they can trust to give good advice.', 'There is a point-of-view that a senior data scientist is someone who not only knows the theoretical and engineering side of data science but also understands the ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù side of things. I tend to agree. The goal of a consultancy is to deliver value to clients, preferably by addressing their strategic business goals. The impact of AI and data science solutions is measured by how effectively they solve the client‚Äôs business needs. If you want to have a bigger impact as a data scientist, you need to understand these needs and figure out how to best serve them.', 'For example, when writing a data science project proposal, I make sure whenever possible that we are addressing a business goal with a clear business metric that tells us how much value we deliver if we succeed. Once we have a clear target on the business side, then we can translate that into data science tasks and their accompanying metrics. This ensures that our work is meaningful, serves as a great motivator to people working on the project and invites buy-in from the business stakeholders on the client-side.', 'On a related note, if you would like to grow as a data scientist, then besides becoming an expert on some deep technical topics, the consultancy business also provides you an excellent opportunity to do some business/strategic advisory work for the client. As one of my colleagues put it, if you have a good understanding of both the technical and strategic side of AI and data-driven organisational change, then you can consider yourself having acquired a superpower. Of course, this will take time and it also depends on your personal ambitions. For myself, I find the topics related to business strategy quite interesting and I‚Äôm looking forward to learning more.', 'There are a lot of books written about sales and consultancy. When compiling my relatively short reading list, I tried to focus on books that were mentioned in at least a few of Top-10 lists and considered ‚Äúessential‚Äù or ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù. This list is by no means exhaustive but provides a good starting point for a data scientist who wants to look beyond their horizon.', 'The books by Miller & Heiman might be considered ancient by now, but they do provide a nice systematic (albeit quite wordy) view of the sales process and give a solid foundation for further learning. I found many great insights from the books of Lencioni and Maister on how to establish a trustful long-term relationship with a client. In the end, that is what consultancy is all about. Finally, I found Seth Godin‚Äôs book very inspiring, as it forced me to consider what is the unique perspective that I bring to my day-to-day work.', 'Photo by Kolar.io on Unsplash']","['Proactive communication is your primary risk management tool', 'Aspire to be a trusted advisor to clients and colleagues alike', 'Look towards solving strategic business goals of the client to increase your impact', 'The client is unable to give you access to their data in a timely manner. This can happen when not all stakeholders on the client side share the same feeling of urgency for forging ahead. For example, the IT person (or whoever is your project counterpart) on the client-side who is responsible for giving you access to the data might have a lot on her table and does not prioritize this task. Explain to them what this delay means to the project schedule and the urgency of this first step. Communicate as frequently as needed with your counterpart until the issue is resolved. In the end, the data scientist/IT person from the client-side might be annoyed with you, but not as much as the client PO would be when she finds out the project has been delayed, again.', 'Does the client have unrealistic expectations regarding what can be done with AI or within the available schedule of the project? Challenge them and discuss what solution fits their actual needs the best. Don‚Äôt be afraid to share your opinion (in a respectful way, of course). More often than not, you are the expert in the room and even if the client does not necessarily like it when you pop their bubble, they will appreciate your sincere effort to do the best you can to help them. If you do not manage expectations regarding the possibilities of AI or the outcome of the project, you may risk having an unhappy client even though you delivered what is in your opinion a good result.', 'The client is not sure whether you are the best person to solve their problem. The best way to show your credibility is not by waving your CV and asserting that, yes you are in fact the expert, but by illustrating your knowledge. If the client already mentioned what challenges they have, then you can begin a discussion on how you would start solving them. Maybe mention your previous experience that might be relevant. In the end, you are a consultant and the best way to deliver value to the client is by getting started on solving their problem right away. The sooner you deliver value, the happier your client will be.

During these two years, I have started to take it for granted but lately bringing some friends to join the event and hearing their thoughts on it, I‚Äôve realized we have something quite special going on here.', 'We consultants live in a constantly changing world and the ability to adapt into those changes is important. That‚Äôs why learning is a key part of our company culture. Tech Weeklies is one of the ways we share our knowledge inside and outside the company and learn from each other‚Äôs knowledge, expertise and experience.', 'Most of the new initiatives at Futurice are started because someone working at the company wants to make something happen. The story of Tech Weeklies started in the spring of 2012 when one of our developers, Jarno, wanted to start a knowledge sharing session.', '‚ÄúI propose ""Frontend Futurice Weeklies"", each Friday, around 15:00 or so. Agenda would be fixed to 3 mini-talks (5 min apiece) and relevant discussions (5 min apiece). [...] Because we won\'t expect the presenter to be an expert on the subject. We\'re talking about recent events, so he/she probably has zero experience on it.‚Äù - Jarno', 'The concept has evolved a bit, now we aim to have two talks of roughly 30 minutes but we remain flexible: sometimes it‚Äôs a session for the full hour, sometimes it‚Äôs lightning talks and sometimes a bit more workshop-style approach.', 'Anyone in the company is welcome to share and during these years we‚Äôve had hundreds of interesting talks. We have seen talks about different technologies or programming paradigms, hobby project showcases, stories and learnings from client projects or shared learnings from trips to conferences around the world. Every now and then we also go across competence borders and have designers sharing about their expertise to build a larger understanding.', 'And that‚Äôs what I like about our culture: many great things happen because people want to do something and we have a flexible culture that encourages taking initiative.', '', 'Tech Weeklies offers so many opportunities for people to learn and grow as professionals. Not only by listening to other people talk but also by sharing what they know. I personally believe that teaching is a wonderful way to learn. By giving a talk or hosting a workshop, you usually do a bit more research into the topic. This leads to a deeper understanding of the topic and approaching it from different perspectives than you might normally do in your day-to-day life. Second, you improve your communication skills which is another important skill for a software consultant in the world of 2020. We communicate with our team members and clients all the time and giving a talk in Tech Weeklies can help us gain more confidence in presenting.', '""Tech Weeklies has worked for me really well as a platform for gaining more confidence in presenting in front of an audience. I have noticed that the best way to truly learn a topic is to have a presentation about it ‚Äì it makes you have to figure it out yourself first before being able to talk about it."" - Olavi', ""Some of our developers have started in Tech Weeklies, then shared those presentations on local meetups and now are speaking in international conferences so only the sky's the limit. Tech Weeklies is also a platform to practice new talks, do grand rehearsals before upcoming conferences or for those who speak a lot in different events, an opportunity to have a bit more fun in a relaxed environment."", 'Learning also happens on multiple different levels, not limited to the content or duration of the talk. It helps us build organizational knowledge of who knows about what topic. The follow-up discussions in Slack or in-person are less visible but very valuable.', 'For many of us Futuriceans, a big reason to join the company is to learn and grow and I‚Äôm happy we are able to provide one platform for that growth with Tech Weeklies.', 'All of our Tech Weeklies sessions we stream across all our sites around Europe via hangouts. Anyone from any site can present and anyone at the company can join either at the office or individually from wherever they work from. We also record most of the talks (the speaker always has the final word whether they want to be recorded or not) and share them internally the same day or at the beginning of the next week.', 'Internally sharing experience and expertise is good for business but we also love sharing to the world. We share our talks via our Futurice Youtube channel and via our podcast so that everyone can enjoy Tech Weeklies presentations and learn something new.', 'Every now and then we also invite guest speakers to give talks and invite people to join to get a glimpse of our Friday afternoons. For example, this past January we hosted Azure Afterwork with Microsoft‚Äôs Jussi Roine sharing the lessons learned from 10 years of Azure and we invited community members to join us for an afternoon.', 'Some of my personal favorites of recent talks are James‚Äôs How to Improve Your Open Source Docs, Judith‚Äôs Who needs PDF generators? - Using the browser to print nice multipage documents and Axel‚Äôs io-ts ‚Äì And Why You Should Want It.', 'As I mentioned in the beginning, I joined the company roughly two years ago. During that time, I‚Äôve given 7 talks myself and I joined the team running Tech Weeklies last year to help host the events, find and encourage people to give talks and also help our developers to find events and conferences their Tech Weeklies talks would be a great fit for.', 'As a meetup organizer myself, the ability to run a weekly tech meetup with such a great pool of good speakers and interesting topics is a dream come true. And seeing people grow and learn and then venture to bigger stages warms my heart.']",[]

It's not the first sector to get disrupted. Things are likely to play out similarly to other business sectors‚Äîand companies can capitalise while carving out their competitive advantage,"['Experimenting to extend your own domain', 'It‚Äôs not about who can collect the most data', 'Bridging the gap without direct access to consumers', 'Why predictive analytics ‚Äì and the right kind of data ‚Äì matters', 'Unique data is the best protection against copycats', 'Get started sooner rather than later']","['Some of the largest and most far-reaching changes in any business sector today are happening in the mobility landscape. But luckily, it‚Äôs not the first sector to get disrupted. Even as the entire industry shifts, certain things are likely to play out similarly to other sectors ‚Äì and companies can leverage this to carve out competitive advantage.', 'This is the second post in my two-part blog series that focuses on utilizing data in the mobility industry. You can read the first part, which covers the virtuous cycle of data, value and trust,here. ', 'Having witnessed the digital revolution across a variety of sectors, we know that a whole new breed of new business models and solutions ‚Äì powered by a combination of digital services and connected physical products ‚Äì can appear virtually overnight and spread at an incredible pace, often profiting from network effects.', 'At the same time, new ideas can get copied equally quickly due to low entry barriers as well as business models that are trivially easy to imitate ‚Äì consider electric scooters, for example‚Äì or disrupt due to a weak linkage between the customer and services or products. In times of high competition, customer experiences and trust are what counts.', 'For anyone planning to come out on top, the new status quo calls for better experiments that help companies identify where their core strengths and weaknesses lie relative to the value they create for the customers and the kind of customer relationship they are pursuing. At the same time, new ideas can be tested for their uniqueness and ease-to-copy during the experiment by asking a series of questions investigating how sustainable an advantage is.', ' Ideally, these experiments should go beyond each company‚Äôs own offering. In order to leverage the true potential of your customer relationship in a world where no one will ever control the entire multi-modal customer journey, you are better off teaming up and building partnerships that are in line with your value proposition, and have similar promises towards the customer. The users won‚Äôt stop where your offering stops ‚Äì if you and your partners are unable to meet their needs, they‚Äôll simply look elsewhere. Additionally, an ecosystem that shares usage data in various levels of anonymization will allow you to understand your customers before and after the touchpoints where you directly interact with them.', 'The more multi-modal our partnerships become, the more (and better!) data we will generate, and this enables us to fulfill not only vertical, but also horizontal user needs. Uncovering patterns and predicting behaviors allows you and your partners to continuously adapt your offering and optimize value creation throughout the value chain.', 'At its core, forming data-enabled ecosystems is a matter of scale with far-reaching consequences. Small tweaks to your service alone may result in incremental improvement of your offering and marginal gains in your customer relationship. But as I‚Äôve discussed in the first part of this blog series, there‚Äôs a lot more to be done with the latent data we collect around public and private mobility. At the moment, however, there isn‚Äôt much exchange between the different providers, and consequently, only very limited added value to the individual user, resulting a very low utility for the users who choose to share their data. We are missing out on a huge opportunity to improve the quality of mobility and its value proposition, and failing to show users how their contribution of data helps make their travelling better.', 'As digital literacy and awareness of the true value of data increases, expectations grow as well. If the benefits of sharing are not made completely obvious and apparent to the average customer, we risk moving into a direction where asking users to share their data will be met with growing skepticism and friction. And for anyone who wants to expand their business by collecting data, that‚Äôs not a good situation to be in.', 'The collection of data comes with a considerable fallacy. As described by Andrei Hagiu and Julian Wright in their article on data creating a competitive advantage, many companies directly link the collection of data to network effects, assuming that the only way to succeed requires a very large amount of data to create a competitive advantage. But not every company has the possibility to create a product that relies on network effects. In these cases, another approach might be more relevant.', 'Until very recently, getting customer insights has been an arduous process that requires extensive customer research using focus groups, surveys and other labor-intensive research tools. Especially in the automotive industry, OEMs ‚Äì due largely to their distance to customers through national sales organizations and dealers ‚Äì have had a hard time getting direct customer insights and optimizing their products accordingly.', 'Recent developments in technology and communication, such as cloud or edge computing, fast wireless networks and increased processing power, have changed this. Today, even car manufacturers and their supplier network can collect customer and usage data directly and gain a more comprehensive understanding of their customers. Now that companies are able to interact with their customers more directly, demonstrating the value of their data sharing and building a trusting relationship is much easier, and that, in turn, can help them develop an advantage over their competitors.', 'It is now easier than ever to analyze how the products built on data really change the way we use our means of transport through real-time traffic information, vehicle-to-everything connections, crowdsourced data, optimized charging, or sharing platforms. Companies like Mobileye, who provide driving assistance systems, require a huge amount of data used to optimize a product for the customer. The more high quality data they have access to and are able to use, the safer their product becomes, and each incremental improvement in safety benefits every user.', 'It should be perfectly clear, then, that it isn‚Äôt the company that collects the most data but the one that uses it best, that can generate the most significant competitive advantage. After all, if the safety of your children is on the line, who wants to have only the second best system? This alone requires a lot of trust from the customer, which in practice means that you must demonstrate the value clearly and show that you directly use it to improve the product for the benefit of everyone.', 'It should also go without saying that appropriate use of data includes taking the necessary steps and precautions to keep it safe. Nothing is as efficient at undoing every last bit of trust between your customer and your company as losing or misusing data. And as trust disintegrates and users flock out of your platform with their data, you‚Äôll also lose any competitive advantage that trust may have gained you.', 'Of course, not everybody has direct customer contact or the ability to provide direct value for shared data. This includes companies like Urban Engines which uses real-time consumer travel data to help public transit agencies visualize, analyze and improve public transit network performance, or TransLoc and RideCell that are helping transport agencies optimize and automate operations by developing technology platforms to help them integrate flexible, on-demand services that can supplement their traditional high-occupancy, fixed-route fleets. Another great example is Inrix, that enables businesses, cities, public transport companies or OEMs to improve everything from the mobility experience over traffic flows to finding the best location for your retail business.', 'For these companies, it is crucial to be able to communicate the bigger picture of how they use data, and send the message that their offered value makes everybody profit in the long run. Their ultimate goal is not to provide direct value to the individual customer, but improve the offering as a whole. By proxy, the utility for the end-user is less direct and the advantage comes through the mass of data as well as the precision of their predictions, tools and algorithms.', 'In these cases, it is not so much a question of whether your predictions are better by one percent at improving individual cases ‚Äì it is much more about how you are able to use the real-time and historic data to improve the experience as a whole, maybe by 10 or 15 percent, perhaps even a hundred. This also implies that an individual customer‚Äôs insights are not going to increase the overall utility the same way it does with more user-centric products.', 'As new services are launched into the market, a legitimate (or perceived) lack of regulation, or confusion about their supporting infrastructure or complementary role within the mobility ecosystem may emerge and spark public controversy. In the worst case, this may result in bans and prohibition, similar to what has happened with many sharing services like electric scooters, ride-hailing or city bikes.', 'In these cases, the related issues were already a subject of heated public discussion by the time that the service providers began focusing on the way these services are in fact used and studying whether they tend to replace pedestrian traffic or trips by car. By predicting usage and behavior beforehand, we can prevent this and ensure that new services live in a symbiotic relationship with other forms of mobility services.', 'Another important aspect to consider is that you act on data that is still relevant and valid. If you keep recommending your customers a route with a public transit connection based on outdated incidental data, and another provider is able to offer real-time data instead, you will probably end up losing this customer because your service provides less value. Speed and precision is key here.', 'Having access to real-time is much less of a concern for example when the focus is on improving infrastructure, like Replica or Remix. In these cases, the optimal outcome is more dependent on being able to make the right decision based on all the available data that you were able to collect. Much akin to search engines, this requires a lot of historical data, and the more high quality data you have and are able to use to create value, the higher your competitive advantage.', 'New urban intelligence platforms like Placemeter try to combine these two aspects, aggregating all kinds of data from videos and a wealth of different platforms to optimize smart mobility solutions, streamline traffic flows, improve pedestrian crossings or assess the safety of intersections.', 'The last important aspect I want to shed light on in this article is the ease to copy, collect or reconstruct the user data that you need in order to offer your service. If the same data is very easy to collect, or maybe even openly available ‚Äì e.g. from a public mobility provider ‚Äì and you simply use it to show departure times or give route recommendations, your advantage may be quite small in this regard.', 'On the other hand, when you collect data through your own hardware or ecosystem, and you have discovered a way of using this data to create value for your users, it is typically much harder to copy. This, in turn, creates higher entry barriers into your market.', 'A trusted ride-hailing company likely knows exactly where and when the demand hits its peaks, and can use that information to ensure rides are available at a moment‚Äôs notice when the time is right. Using data to scale your ability to respond to micro-level changes in customer needs like this is one of the cornerstones of creating value in the era of data-enabled mobility services.', 'Regardless of where you are on the path of establishing trust with your customers to generate data, and leveraging that trust to create a competitive edge, it is important to get in motion early on, and keep thinking a couple of steps ahead.', 'Seven out of the ten most valuable companies in the world today have built their business around data. Several new companies also in the ride-hailing and micro mobility domain have already established solid data strategies and platforms, and built entire business models around data.', 'For traditional organizations, responding to this wake-up call means integrating existing portfolios and developing new intelligent services, partnerships and ecosystems under their parent brand or as a standalone entity as they try to catch up.', 'All of this ‚Äì from data strategies and platforms to designing and building new human-centric offerings and services as well as the optimal technology stack to support them in a resilient manner ‚Äì is something we at Futurice are well equipped to help with.', 'Cities are in constant motion, and urbanization increases the speed and density of this movement, which translates to an increasingly wide range of behaviors and mobility needs and scenarios. Only by knowing their customers well enough, and offering them the right mix between convenience, safety, equity, sustainability, flexibility, effectiveness and connectivity, are companies able to build a service that is difficult enough to copy.', 'In summary, we don‚Äôt think there is just one answer to how you should utilize the trust of your users to create more value and a competitive advantage for your company. There are many aspects to consider, but the overarching theme is that in order to maximize your chances for success, you will need to understand your own goal for using data, as well as who you are improving the product or service for, in what context and what time frame.']",[]

There‚Äôs a big difference between being a coder and being a developer.', 'I joined Tammerforce, the Tampere office of Futurice, as a summer employee in May 2018. My background was not the most typical one for a software developer. I had a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Business Administration, some working experience from e.g. university research and development (mainly in social services), lots of experience performing in front of an audience as a semi-professional musician, some marketing gigs, event organizing and such. As a matter of fact, I only had very minor experience within IT ‚Äì just a few months of consultancy work the previous summer, two years of very lazy studies in the local university, several smaller scale projects of my own, and an active role in organizing TampereJS, a local web developer meetup. I had also spent a lot of time in the local startup community, getting into business development, lean validation, and all that jazz.', 'To be honest, I was never interested in computers when growing up. The reason I got into coding in my mid-20s was because I saw it as a way to create something ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù ‚Äì or as concrete as intangible digital things can be, anyway. To me, coding seemed in many ways similar to creating music, one of my favorite hobbies for years: starting with nothing, sitting in front of a computer for a few nights, and ending up with a song, or in this case, something like a working web app.', 'As a result, I feel that as an employee, my biggest strength is not my technical capability. To be clear, I don‚Äôt feel incapable as a coder, but I do feel that I‚Äôm not using my full potential if I‚Äôm limited to strictly implementing technical tasks defined by someone else. This was something that weighed heavily when looking for a job back in spring 2018. So when I started at Futurice, I had high hopes of not being ‚Äújust a coder‚Äù, but being able to contribute in more ways in my work.', 'When I started at Tammerforce, I joined a client team as the fourth developer. At first I worked on some smaller tickets in products ‚Äì that we had built earlier for the client ‚Äì that needed some small additional features developed or issues fixed, while getting used to the tools and ways of working. From the beginning, my teammates asked my opinion on doing things, and I pushed for e.g. enforcing a clean git history for easier maintenance work. Even as the newest and least experienced developer, my thoughts and contributions were valued, which gave me a strong sense of ownership and commitment in the team, as opposed to making me feel like a ‚Äúresource‚Äù cranking out code.', 'Pretty soon I also got my first larger task of implementing a new feature integrating two customer-facing services together. The specifications were very vague ‚Äì instead, the client had a specific business need, making work easier for their customer service staff. One of the two services submitted contact forms to the customer service email inbox, and the other created customer call reservations into a system used by the customer service agents. In some cases a form and a call slot reservation would be related to each other, and the customer service agents needed this contextual information.', 'Technically these two systems were in no way related to each other. The client had envisioned a solution that involved complex session handling between the two services, which would have required a new backend service to be possible in the first place. After some discussions with the client, I managed to convince them that we should start with the minimum solution that would still solve the problem ‚Äì that is, adding an ID to the submitted forms, passing the form data in query params to the call reservation system when using the direct link, and including the ID there. This way the customer service agent would be easily able to locate a call slot‚Äôs related form from the inbox by searching with the ID.', 'Getting this idea through was a major personal experience of success for three reasons:', 'Long story short, I‚Äôve since been working continuously on the same account, while the other members of the team have rotated to other accounts. During this time my role has constantly evolved and my responsibilities varied. For example, I‚Äôve led a project where I was responsible for developing an algorithm to predict faults in a power grid, learned a lot about configuring Nginx and Ubuntu servers over SSH, become quite familiar with Docker-based DevOps, and hooked Redux to a legacy product built with (among other things) RxJS, just to make debugging with dev tools possible.', 'When working with already existing products and services that have users, you‚Äôll often run into things that are not optimal. Some parts of the code are messy and hard to follow, some documentation is nonexisting, some solutions are ‚Äúdefinitely not what I would do‚Äù, some technical dependencies not exactly cutting edge, and so on. And as the services have users, wiping out the existing code and starting from a clean slate is not an option, no matter how tempting it sounds to a developer. This applies to pretty much all code ‚Äì even when running git blame prints my own name on the screen.', 'There‚Äôs no sugarcoating it: Working with a large legacy codebase with far-from-cutting-edge technologies and no tests is frustrating. I keep hearing people talking about React hooks ‚Äì those sound nice and I would certainly like to try them out. Also, all this talk about serverless, Lambdas and cloud sounds tempting. But in my work, the main point is providing value for the client. I primarily develop services ‚Äì code and technical details are secondary. And when the solved problems are motivating, the technology doesn‚Äôt matter that much.', 'My work has given me lots of interesting and motivating business problems to solve. For example, we are building a large web application (frontend, backend and several microservices) and running four different product flavors of the same application, in eight different server environments. Designing, developing and running that kind of system is a challenging and rewarding task in itself, even when certain pieces of the whole puzzle are not shiny and new. And the abovementioned fault prediction software is another good example: The existing tech stack and source code were not exactly the latest hip and cool, but designing and developing the prediction algorithm, as well as solving the business problem of pre-emptively allocating repair personnel to minimize grid downtime, were both challenging and motivating things to work on.', 'One thing that people often associate with working in a consultancy is this dreaded model of delivering something quickly and never seeing the thing you built in action. This is far from what I‚Äôve experienced. The account I‚Äôve been working on has been active for several years now, and apart from very minor exceptions, we keep maintaining and further developing the services we have built for the client. This kind of longevity really creates a sense of ownership and makes me want to ensure the applications we build are good and maintainable. Not just because of professional pride, but also because I will be involved in fixing them if they break.', 'Another very rewarding aspect for me has been deepening the client relationship and my personal role in it. During my time in Tammerforce, the team has more than doubled in size, and I‚Äôm currently the Scrum Master in a longer running development project.', 'My daily work involves continuous communication with the client, development task allocation, application level coding, DevOps, onboarding new team members, participating in sales and account management, and whatnot.', 'And that‚Äôs just what I do in the account work.', 'One of my favorite things about working at Tammerforce is the balance between feeling like working in a large company, and working in a small company. With its 500+ employees and offices in multiple countries, Futurice as a whole is an environment that offers financial stability and large scale international opportunities, whereas Tammerforce with its 70+ employees is quite an agile environment to work in. There‚Äôs not a lot of bureaucracy, and I for one have been able to do pretty much anything that I felt like doing in my work.', ' Some of my more crucial marketing contributions.', 'In addition to my primary duties I have done for example marketing, recruitment events, student organization collaboration, sales support, some workshop facilitation, speaking at events, and surprisingly many minutes of acting in front of a camera. I‚Äôve also been organizing some ‚Äúextracurricular activities‚Äù ‚Äì such as organizing an employee cruise, and engaging my coworkers in a wellness campaign.', 'So when someone asks me what my job is about, I like to say that I develop things: software, systems, services, business, processes, client relations, marketing, communities, my colleagues‚Äô tolerance of bad puns, my biceps and whatnot. Coding is just one of the tools I commonly use in my work.', 'If developing things in the heart of Tampere sounds appealing to you, check out what Tammerforce has to offer at https://promise.tammerforce.com/']","['Most importantly, I felt like my opinion was valued, not just as a coder but more broadly as a developer, whose main task is to solve problems and create value.', 'This led us to the problem being solved faster and with lower costs, instead of building something more complex only to potentially realize it doesn‚Äôt actually make the customer service agents‚Äô work any easier.', 'I had no idea how to build the initially suggested and more complex solution (but let‚Äôs not dwell too much on minor details like that).']"

Its performance is very different from a row store like MySQL or Postgres. If you use it like a row store ‚Ä¶ you will be burned! The main difference is that if a column needs to be accessed to calculate a result set, every single row for that column will be accessed. Your costs are a factor of the number of rows multiplied by the columns accessed (so also never do SELECT *).', 'Typically, you will want a fat-table design, where you minimize the number of rows by either creating many tables or have many columns per table.

Partitioning is critical to keeping costs bounded.', ""Also when developing complex queries, sometimes you are not even sure the query planner can exploit the partition structure or not. \nThis is why I also consider it essential to have BigQuery reject full table scans by using the require_partitioning_filter flag on the table definition.

To come out on top, they will need to understand the role of data in the future of mobility, and pay attention to building trust and creating customer value in the changing business landscape.\n', 'For the vast majority of car buyers nowadays, owning the largest, fastest or most powerful car in the neighborhood is a thing of the past. Priorities are moving from a focus on perfection in driving experience towards an overall optimized mobility experience.\nUnfortunately, this change is not something that automotive companies can address simply by offering a balanced and comprehensive model range. Compelling mobility services as we understand them today are created with much more than just cars. They extend beyond the physical world and encompass a variety of digital and data-enabled features that tie everything together, and into cohesive digital services.\nData is the most important factor at the core of this equation ‚Äì and harnessing it may cause some grey hairs for car manufacturers, as it requires insight and skill sets that many of them have not previously had. At any rate, it is something they‚Äôll need to tackle to be able to keep creating more value for their customers, discover new business models and evolve existing value chains.', 'Global megatrends such as urbanization, sustainability, and the sharing economy are clear indicators of shifting customer needs and preferences ‚Äì which require companies to react early and at a rapid pace. The same applies to car manufacturers as the mobility journey keeps evolving and extending beyond car ownership.\nThe change is also evident in various surveys and statistics. Today, fewer and fewer people in Europe and the US get a driver‚Äôs licence. At the same time, the sharing economy has already found its way into the mobility domain with new on-demand and peer-to-peer mechanisms that are considered viable alternatives to car ownership and ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù taxi drivers. Predictions suggest that by 2025, the mobility market will have fewer incumbents and an estimated value of $335 billion.', 'The use of data and its rapid growth are central factors in these market shifts as well. This will apply especially in the autonomous future, where the various sensors and systems of a self-propelled car may end up generating as much as four terabytes‚Äô worth of data every day.', 'Previously, the data generated by cars was used to create the perfect car experience. Today, we utilize it to build the best mobility experience. And over time, as cars become more and more connected, it may eventually be used to create a better overall life experience alongside many other sources. But in order to do so, we need to first understand data and how we can leverage it in more ways, both individually and together with trusted partners.', '', 'For companies investing in the mobility industry, attempting to own their customers‚Äô end-to-end mobility journey is typically not an efficient use of their time and effort. Instead, they should focus on playing to their individual core strengths and building and positioning their own brand in the field, while establishing smart partnerships with companies that represent similar values and target demographics, and a customer experience to complete your offering.\nThe beauty of partnerships is that they can be established across and between sectors that haven‚Äôt necessarily meshed well previously. As cars themselves become platforms for various services, mobility companies may find themselves teaming up with retail, health or media companies in addition to their usual energy, travel or finance partners. This allows everybody to reach and conquer their target segments on a wider scale ‚Äì as long as the partners are on the same level in terms of the quality of their service and offering.', 'Previously, the automotive industry has had a very straightforward value chain ‚Äì you‚Äôd offer your product or solution to a customer that paid for it. But utilizing data will bring a whole new set of customers and revenue models within reach, and enable asset-focused and engineering-driven companies to shift towards becoming driven by ‚Äúhumanized‚Äù data.\nIt is estimated that by 2030, around 20% of the automotive industry‚Äôs profit potential will come from data-driven services. This means all car manufacturers will eventually need to switch from a purely product-based mindset and direct revenues over to a hybrid mix of digital and physical services, and both direct and indirect revenues from above and below in the value chain. The shift will involve multi-sided revenue models based on components such as subscriptions and rentals, licensing, certifications, and advertising ‚Äì to mention just a few.', '', 'With a holistic mix of digital and physical services, it is possible to create personalized experiences that meet unique user needs and utilize physical portfolios optimally, in beneficial ways. In practice, this could mean enabling onboard systems for all kinds of changing usage and sharing scenarios by default, or allowing third parties to complement the digital offering through APIs or projects like the Open Smart City API.', 'Even as the market landscape evolves and sprawls into new directions, traditional automotive OEMs will have a clear trust advantage that will help them solidify their position. Consumers already trust their engineering enough to feel confident that their products will function safely at high speeds.\nIf they manage to extend that trust to the way they use their customers‚Äô data and demonstrate that they can create additional tangible customer value with it, people are likely to keep favoring their services, and also feel comfortable sharing more. That continued use, and the additional data streams it will generate, is key to detecting and understanding new trends early on, and reacting to them at the right time ‚Äì which in turn will help generate more value for customers ‚Äì and your business.', 'And the cycle goes on: that added value breeds more trust. As interactive personal assistants or search engines have shown us, if the value they offer customers is tangible and obvious enough, they tend to become less anxious. When people have established a certain level of trust in your service, they are willing to share more.', 'But in order to use data to create more customer value, the automotive industry will first have to learn how to understand data and use it to solve problems before they emerge ‚Äì much like a traffic prediction model that helps guide decision-making.', 'Generally speaking, there are three different approaches to monetizing customer data:', 'In business contexts, data is often described as the new oil. But, to use a car analogy, the way data is typically used today has more in common with exhaust fumes ‚Äì a mere by-product of doing business, rather than something that fuels it or makes it run smoother. In any sustainable data-powered business, customer value should be the ultimate driving force ‚Äì or the engine, so to speak. And once customers have been assured of your value proposition, data can become both the input and output of services ‚Äì the fuel and emissions at the same time.', 'As more companies come into possession of data, they have to ask themselves how to balance maximizing the use of data on the one hand, and their customers‚Äô trust on the other. In the era of the personal data economy, trust is paramount, and as more data gets collected, this will only become more pronounced.', 'Even after all the recent tumult and scandals in the car industry, people tend to trust established mobility companies more than startups. A key factor in this is that customers tend to see cars as well-engineered and secure products, and something it is possible to physically interact with. This reputation can be leveraged to forge new partnerships and business models with other established brands to create innovative, trusted ecosystems.', 'Successfully monetising data within sustainable networks of trusted partners is not the whole picture. Careful brand positioning is crucial. A complete data strategy should clearly indicate and reflect who and what exactly a mobility company wants to be. This includes clarifying the wider goals, purpose and mission, how each of these will be achieved, and how far the company is willing to go.', '', 'Trust and value creation are the guiding factors behind different data strategies, and as the matrix shows, companies can fall into one of many categories. Mobility companies should plan their desired position carefully and weigh the relative advantages and disadvantages before making a decision.', '', 'Once a data strategy has been set and the connection between trust, data and value is understood, it‚Äôs time to start dealing with data and change more proactively. Starting with the least delicate or politically difficult topic is the smart thing to do, as it helps make success visible, easily shareable, and can create the necessary trust and guidance within the organization to proceed further.', 'The most important consideration in any data strategy is clear value created for the customer. To maximize the value and benefit of data use for all parties, come up with a data value chain: Ask why, understand the how, and decide on the what, based on hard data. And finally, always take data protection seriously.', 'As the entire industry strives to understand its customers better, the first step in every part of the value chain ‚Äì from OEMs and suppliers to infrastructure providers ‚Äì should be to take a moment to reflect on these questions:', 'You would like to dig deeper and learn more about the interplay of data and innovation?

This is due to a wide range of practical use cases, from vehicle detection, pedestrian detection and driverless cars to face detection and security systems, which have inspired both the academia and industry to create faster and more accurate machine learning models.', 'Object detection refers to localizing the objects in an image and correctly identifying them. Some of the main challenges in this context are related to obtaining high accuracy and generalization across different backgrounds and positions of the objects. Now imagine you want to do all this on mobile and in real time. On top of the previous issues, the new environment entails constraints regarding the speed and size of the model.', 'These are all important points we had to consider when we recently set off to create an Android application that keeps an inventory of items in a basket. The main requirements of such an app are that:', '', 'This article describes our thought process and learnings, from labeling data and choosing an object detection model, to training and deploying it in an Android app. The goal is to provide an understanding of all the steps involved in the creation of the app, especially our approaches to mitigating false positives and improving the accuracy of the model.', 'Undeniably, the biggest pain of training an object detection model is labeling data and we experienced this first-hand. For industry use cases, the common framework for training object detection models relies on transfer learning: a model is pre-trained on a huge dataset to recognize different common objects and this knowledge is leveraged through fine-tuning on a smaller target dataset, containing the objects relevant to the use case. The alternative would be to train a model from scratch on target data, which requires the availability of a huge dataset. Thus, through transfer learning, time and computational resources are drastically saved.', 'There are multiple tools available for labeling object detection datasets: LabelImg, LabelBox, makesense.ai etc. We used the latter tool, which is open-source and offers a nice and engaging UI. Amazon offers the Mechanical Turk service for crowdsourcing your labels, which is recommended if you have more than 1000 images (as we had less, we did the labeling ourselves, about 7 days of work for 1 person). For labeling the data, we introduced the labels in the tool (for example ‚Äúapple‚Äù, ‚Äúbanana‚Äù etc.), uploaded the pictures, and started drawing rectangles around these previously defined objects. Once all the objects in the images are labeled, the tool offers 3 formats for exporting the annotations, including VOC XML in which one XML file containing the coordinates of the bounding boxes is generated per image. The final dataset consists of the images and the XML files matching the names of the image files.', '', 'There are several rules of thumb when it comes to labeling data for object detection, but nothing is set in stone. Most resources and GitHub issues talking about how to label data will say that it depends on the case and it‚Äôs a trial and error process. For the creation of our training dataset we aimed to have between 1500-2000 labels per object, with the objects in all positions (vertically, horizontally, sideways, stacked etc).  In general, it is recommended to have between 500-1000 labels per object, but because of the many different views and angles of our objects, as well as high similarity, we wanted to make sure that the model learns the shape and discriminative features between the objects, so we labeled double the amount. This adds up to approximately 600 images, split into 400 training images and 200 test images.', 'One dilemma that we experienced is that of labeling objects that are overlapping with only a small part of them visible. For these situations we defined the following rule of thumb: as the goal of a model is to learn the shape of an object, imagine the object in isolation and if you would be able to identify it without subjectively ‚Äúinferring‚Äù from the context. Thus, if the object in isolation makes sense, label it, otherwise ignore it. Another rule of thumb that we used is that if 2 objects are close to each other or even overlapping, we tried as much as possible to not label where the object should be, but only the visible parts (if they make sense in isolation). Another idea to consider (which we didn‚Äôt have time to experiment ourselves) is to take pictures of the objects with varying backgrounds. For our model, we took images of the objects in the context in which they will be found in production, although taking pictures of the objects in different environments with different backgrounds, will likely help the model generalize better.', 'When it comes to object detection models, there are several computer vision architectures which are popular and come up again and again in discussions on this topic. Current state-of-the-art includes models like YOLOv3, SSD, Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN etc.  It‚Äôs all fun and games, until you reach the accuracy-speed trade-off: the more accurate your model is, the slower it will be at inference time.

When the team has not yet established these kinds of norms, asking a question is like sticking your neck out while bright spotlights point at you and enthusiastic, axe-wielding executioners patrol the area. It‚Äôs much safer to keep quiet.', ""The second obstacle arises from group dynamics. The theory of diffusion of responsibility posits that the larger a group is, the less likely it is that anyone will take responsibility for a specific task. So a team of two is far more likely to take action than a team of four in the same situation. Besides team size, specific roles and expertise give rise to this diffusion of responsibility. In essence, it all boils down to thinking, ‚ÄúWhy should I ask that question? The others aren‚Äôt and I‚Äôm not the most qualified here, isn't this the responsibility of this or that role?‚Äù"", 'There are other patterns stacked against asking stupid questions as well. Take confirmation bias, for example: At the beginning of a project, and especially in a consulting setting, we are looking for confirmation that we are ready for this, and the trust others have placed in us is justified. And according to the Ostrich effect, if we pretend a specific risk or problem is not there, it isn‚Äôt, and maybe it will go away. Combined, these psychological phenomena are very much linked to the concept of psychological safety.', 'To make it more likely that those important, challenging questions are asked, we developed the Project Navigation Game. It is, as the name suggests, a game, complete with more than 250 questions that help teams explore anything that may have been overlooked when setting up the project.', 'Above we discussed two main obstacles: social acceptance (wanting to belong to the group) and diffusion of responsibility (the group‚Äôs dynamic of inactivity). So how exactly does the Project Navigation Game help us steer around these obstacles?', 'First and foremost, it is a game ‚Äì and one thing a game does is that it uses its rules to define the norms of the group of players. Following the rules is the norm, so if the game rules say ‚Äúchoose a card with a challenging question and ask it,‚Äù asking that question is considered acceptable behavior. Furthermore, as the question is defined by the card, the player is able to outsource any judgment on the question itself to the creators of the game (and we‚Äôre fine with that). The rules of the game change what the players consider to be the safest course of action in order to belong: follow the rules ‚Äì that is, ask questions.', '', 'The second aspect ‚Äì that of diffusion of responsibility ‚Äì is similarly circumvented by defining the responsibilities of each player as being the same. Each player has the same role in the game, namely, to ask challenging questions. The reason why you should ask that question instead of the person next to you is simply because you have that card in your hand and they don‚Äôt ‚Äì so within the game, you are the only one who could ask the question.', 'Besides lowering these barriers, the Project Navigation Game also helps the team by providing a set of questions which in turn are derived from Futurice‚Äôs experience of executing over 3000 projects. Among other things, It also helps the members of a newly formed team to get to know each other.', 'Having said this, the Project Navigation Game is not a silver bullet. In teams with strong hierarchies, strong ego types or a very judgmental culture, the game is likely to be too temporary to overcome those barriers. In these situations, a facilitator can help boost the positive effects of the game‚Äôs rules on the team.', 'In summary, our experiences clearly demonstrate that the Project Navigation Game significantly lowers the barrier of asking stupid questions. And just as a reminder, that single ‚Äústupid‚Äù question could very well mean the difference between a satisfied customer and a waste of time, money, motivation, and good ideas.', 'So how can you use this information, besides printing the game (did we mention it‚Äôs open source?) or ordering a copy of the game for yourself? There are three key lessons to take away.', 'The first one is that games are a valuable business tool, and should not be overlooked as just a silly way to do things.', 'The second one is that psychology matters. We are not logical beings, so often we need to help in order to do the thing we intellectually know is good for us.', ""And the third and final point to raise is that judging things like questions is not beneficial in any way. So, whenever you find yourself thinking, ‚ÄúThat's a stupid question,‚Äù complete that thought with, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm glad they asked it!‚Äù"", 'C. Nathan DeWall and Brad J. Bushman (2011).

When I needed a change of scenery, Stuttgart delivered."", 'In the spring of 2020, I will start my 10th year at Futurice. That‚Äôs quite a long stretch in this industry. Sometimes people ask me what has kept me here all this time ‚Äì I mostly say it‚Äôs the people. It‚Äôs really hard for me to even imagine working as a consultant anywhere else, but I joke that since I‚Äôm a big aerospace nerd, if SpaceX calls, I‚Äôll think about it.', '""It‚Äôs the people"" is definitely true, but it‚Äôs also a bit of a cop-out line. This warrants a more thorough examination, and when we do that, we discover that there are many different factors hiding within that simple phrase.', 'There are the ways in which we bring in new people ‚Äì that is to say the way in which we do recruitment; there are the ways in which we let the people thrive and build out our culture; and the ways in which we foster growth and development. Today I‚Äôd like to address the last point in particular, and to be able to do that I‚Äôd first like to give you a little context in the form of my Futurice career journey so far.', 'The way I remember it, I joined Futurice in Tampere, Finland with a vague idea of possibly getting to develop something on Windows Phone. I never did, although I did write some Android stuff before settling squarely on a web tech track, and that has been my focus since. We were tiny back then, at fewer than 20 people, many of whom I‚Äôm proud to call my friends. Many have left, many more have joined.', 'Today, Tammerforce, as the Tampere team is known, is more than 70 strong, has successfully switched its daily working language from Finnish to English, occupies one of the coolest office spaces you can imagine, and just generally keeps on being the best version of itself, year in year out.', 'The Tampere team has always had a very particular culture within Futurice, but it has never had to become an exclusive insider environment in order to preserve that special status. Everybody is invited to dance, and although the site is not quite as diverse as our Helsinki office, there is a wonderful mix of different backgrounds to draw upon, which is a great boon in our creative work.', 'So, this was the environment in which I worked, designing and developing systems. Along the way I learned new technologies, and I learned about new ways of working. Attended some courses, went to conferences, that sort of thing.', 'But eventually I started to feel like I needed a change. I felt like I might have been reaching my limits as an individual contributor. I wanted to increase my impact ‚Äì but how? I didn‚Äôt feel like becoming a manager, and while broadening my technical knowledge is always interesting, I could not see a particular path emerging that way either.', 'I was not unhappy by any stretch, but I felt like maybe I could do more. And as it happens, an amazing opportunity was about to present itself.', 'The way Futurice grows is usually this: There is a new client. We do work for said client. The client is happy! The client wants more Futurice work. It makes sense to be close to the client because nothing beats talking to a living, breathing person who‚Äôs sat across the table from you. Futurice sets up a new site where the client is. There is much rejoicing.', 'Last spring, this exact scenario was unfolding. A call went out by email: We were looking for someone who had been at the company for a long time to join the brand new site in Stuttgart, our third site in Germany. They would act as a cultural ambassador to help get all the new people onboarded to Futurice and its values and ways of working, while also doing valuable project work for clients.', 'I did not jump on the opportunity immediately, but it did stick in the back of my mind, especially as the person in charge of the search was a Tammerforce alumnus. After a bit of soul-searching I decided that I had to at least give it a try, and replied that I was interested. I had entertained thoughts in the past about perhaps living abroad at some point, and I was definitely intrigued with the prospect of seeing a new site develop and being able to help people become part of the Futurice family.', 'After that things moved really quickly. Before I knew it, I was visiting Munich and Stuttgart for the first time, scoping out possible places to live, and getting to know the rest of the project team and my other prospective German colleagues. I was by no means sure that I would succeed or even be comfortable, but I was along for the ride, and when the time came to make a decision, I felt sure enough about myself to say yes.', 'Futurice made it as easy as possible for me: The expat agreement had very good terms, and there are plenty of safety nets in place. I also managed to find a furnished apartment quite quickly, as well as secure a tenant for my place back in Finland. I was in.', '\nProximity to the Porsche Museum may or may not have been a factor when considering the pros and cons of Stuttgart', ""It‚Äôs now been almost three months since I moved here, and one could say the honeymoon period is over. I've had my ups and downs as any normal person living their life has, but I have definitely gotten what I bargained for. The site is small, and recruitment and brand building are crucial, so I attend a lot of meetups and events to represent Futurice and get the word out there, and interview candidates for tech positions."", 'We are a very international crew here, with Germans actually in the minority. As far as a cohesive team identity and sense of belonging goes, I already see a lot of the same potential here that we had in Tampere back in the day, and I think this is a very good sign.

Although I‚Äôm enjoying my time here and trying to make the best of it, my current plan is to return home when my year is up.', 'I feel like I am growing in ways that might not have been possible had I not taken this opportunity, and it will be interesting to think about how I might use these learnings to grow my impact when I return.

One issue that arose was how do end users access their own data? BigQuery is a columnar database, and hence, querying for one users data usually involves scanning all users' data, which is obviously slower and more expensive than necessary."", 'Thus we made the decision to serve end users data through a Redis Key-Value cache hosted in Memorystore which is designed for fast (<10ms) and economical lookups. However, how do we export 100K computed rows from BigQuery to Memorystore quickly?', 'We experimented with many approaches (Dataflow, Bigquery API, App Engine Flex, GCF) before finding the right combination of technologies to do this effectively. Hopefully this post will save you a lot of time if you also need to do this!', ""First, let's talk about what didn't work. A Dataflow batch job didn't because it has a 1 minute spin up time, significantly impacting data freshness latency. Google App Engine (GAE) doesn't work either because the native Redis client is incompatible with the environment. GAE Flex does work technically, but you end up over provisioned (minimum of 1 instance at all times) so it's a bit expensive, especially if you want it to minimize latency and use a large instance type."", 'Google Cloud Functions are a perfect fit, they can run Redis clients and scale to zero! Perfect for spikey workloads such as periodic report dumps. BUT! access to Memorystore is restricted by VPC, which, until recently, would have been a blocker. But now we have the serverless-vpc-connecter allowing the GCF environment to access private networks. So with that technology we were able to build an awesome fully managed event driven general purpose REDIS loader, that scales to zero when not in use.', '', 'The quickest method we found to get data out of BigQuery is an export to Cloud Storage Bucket. Data moves through specially optimized managed pipes and therefore takes just a few seconds to export 100k rows. This is 20x faster than using the BigQuery client (1k rows per second). In our implementation we used the JSON export to format which supports nested fields. Furthermore, we used an additional column as metadata to tell the bulk loader what redis key to index under.', 'The process of exporting to a bucket fires the ""object.change"" storage trigger, which we configured to invoke a Google Cloud Function. The Function uses the Google Cloud Storage client to stream the contents to a redis client.', 'We found maximizing the Google Cloud Function memory resources was a simple and free optimization. Yes, the cost per second increases with memory allocation, but the high memory functions also complete the tasks faster and so total running time was less. Overall the costs stay the same but the high memory functions complete their tasks quicker. With no serious optimization we managed 7K rows per second.', ""The solution is general, in the sense that, any JSON newline delimited file dropped in the bucket will get loaded into Redis. The fact that in our system the data came from Bigquery is incidental. It's only a few lines of code, but it took us a week of experimentation to perfect. Enjoy!""]",[]

On longer projects it can be especially demanding to continually bring new people on board. Therefore it‚Äôs important to create material that is flexible in collecting different perspectives. Visually engaging materials, even very basic maps and diagrams can help bring people on the journey. Sharing the project journey through newsletter and showcases can further support the sharing of knowledge and input gathering.', '', 'In this day and age, where so much information fights for our attention, visual communication is not only important ‚Äì it can be the difference between getting people engaged or not. Making complex issues like sustainability easy to understand and accessible is difficult but important, and the visual part plays a big role here. Sandra Runsten, The New Division', 'Visualizing complex information would simplify for more people to engage and understand. Magnus Lindwall, Telia Company', '-Commitment and alignment across the entire organisation', 'While there is often a lot of interest for sustainability and resilience projects within organisations, for projects like this to succeed, business units need to be willing to invest money and resources into the work. There are strong business cases for every organisation to explore sustainability and resilience including opportunities for growth and investment, innovation, customer loyalty, and brand and market positioning, to name a few.', 'For this reason it‚Äôs important to find the right people across the business to advocate for the work. The business units need to make a commitment to the project through implementation iteration and ongoing improvement. It‚Äôs important to be able to speak the language of multiple parts of the organisation to be able to emphasise the commercial benefits of sustainability and get business buy-in to commit and invest. \nThese initiatives can take a lot of time and money to implement. This is why it‚Äôs important to keep one eye on the strategy. Thinking strategically but acting incrementally and starting with smaller projects or initiatives.', 'Include early. Test different concepts and ideas. Get management buy-in and be clear about the goals ‚Äì but also the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. Why do we do this? Magnus Lindwall, Telia Company', 'Stakeholder management is key to make sure products, services and offerings [are] in line with expectations and to identify opportunities and risks early. A mix of people and backgrounds call for a broader perspective and a better understanding. Further, having co-designed in the process makes roll-out easier and faster. Such management would possibly include internal and external stakeholders; including potential customers/users. Magnus Lindwall, Telia Company', 'None of us can do this alone. But together we can help foster collaborative environments for change, continually iterating and thriving in a resilient future for people, business and the planet.', 'At Futurice we explore different ways to partner with and engage with our clients to aid implementation and together work towards achieving sustainability goals and targets. We believe that the smallest of initiatives need to fit into a broader strategy in order to enable greater business alignment around sustainability. We often run workshops and talks to help organisations kick-start the process. In our workshop on Systems Thinking and Sustainability we explore the broader context around your business and together find opportunities to bridge the gap between your sustainability goals and your day to day business.', 'Want to hear more about our work in this space and how we can work with you on your journey to collaborating for a resilient future?

Before this summer, I had one summer of experience as a software developer."", 'Irene: I\'m Irene and this was my second summer at Futurice in the Helsinki office. I applied to the company for the first time during my first year of studies but got a friendly ""no"" response. After my second year I got a job as a software developer and returned this summer as a data scientist.', ""Niklas: Hi, I'm Niklas, a data scientist studying in Aalto University. I'm now studying for my fifth year and I have previously worked in a bank but for this summer I wanted to try something new so I applied to Futurice in Helsinki. I already knew some people from Futurice and liked them so I wanted to join the team as well."", 'Joel: Hello, I‚Äôm Joel, a designer that has recently graduated from studies in University of Lapland. I applied to Futurice in Tampere after hearing about all of the amazing stuff that my brother who had been in the company for two years already was experiencing there. One could say that I was a little bit jealous. Before graduating and applying to Futurice I had done a few freelancer service design projects in Rovaniemi and had worked for the university.', ""Antti: I've worked on client projects in our Futucare team. We offer maintenance and feature development for longer running projects after their initial development. During the summer I've been involved in multiple projects using different tech stacks. One of my highlights was working on MyHelsinki.fi's Think Sustainably project in which I implemented the HSL integration that you can see on for example Helsinki Art Museum HAM page."", ""Irene: During my two summers I've worked on a few different project. On one of the projects I worked for a client as a frontend developer, I got to develop the app using React, Redux and NodeJS and we used GraphQL which was a new tool for all of us involved in the project."", ""Niklas: This summer I worked in a project that's rethinking the Futurice business. It has been a great opportunity to learn about the relationship between data science and business and how to create value. In this project, we have been coming up with ways to use our own data to help people succeed in their work and keep learning. As a part of this, I build a proof of concept application that uses our internal social networks data to match people who don't know each other, and send them for lunch."", 'Joel: My summer started with an intense period where I was doing a lot of customer interviews for our clients and also making illustrations for various smaller projects. After the sudden influx of projects ended and (almost) everyone went to their summer vacations, I started creating presentation templates and illustrations for Project Navigation Game.', '', ""Antti: My highlight was building a big feature that was published to the real world. In addition to software development, I liked the culture of openness and sharing information. For example, every Friday there's Tech Weeklies where people give tech talks to share information inside the company."", 'Irene: The best part about Futurice is definitely the people - they are the primary reason why I wanted to come back for a second round. There are lots of events and opportunities to meet cool folks with different backgrounds from all around the world. Summer employees are considered full members of the community, and you can strike up a conversation with virtually anyone by the huge coffee machine at Futucaf√©, regardless of their title.', ""Niklas: I really liked working on real and meaningful projects. Working at Futurice as a summer employee is about real work rather than brewing coffee. There's also lots of freedom to choose what to work on."", 'Joel: First off: the people of Futurice. They kept supporting me in projects and guiding me through the summer in a way that really stood out. But in addition to that, I got to work in many interesting and exciting projects that really showed me the impact and the value that my work can have. There was especially one project for S√§rk√§nniemi regarding virtual queues to amusement park devices that was really memorable.', ""Antti: I had one interview and it was one of the most relaxed ones I've ever been in. I showcased a project I had built and the interview felt more like a discussion with colleagues rather than an interview."", 'Irene: Both times I was interviewed by people doing approximately the job I was applying for. I was definitely nervous the first time, since I hadn‚Äôt done many technical interviews, but the process turned out to be far more casual than I had expected.', 'Niklas: Early bird eats the worm. The summer application period was quite early but it was nice to know early on that I had a job for the next summer. I also had one interview and was then offered a job.', 'Joel: Before applying, I had visited the company a couple of times to get to know the company culture and to ask some questions from the designers working there. My first interview was practically a very relaxed chat about the company and my interest towards it. I was quite nervous before it but it set a very friendly tone for the interview process. The second interview felt probably more like a discussion about design than an actual interview.', ""Antti: I learned a lot about communicating with clients and how consulting is much more than just writing code: it's also about solving problems and helping the client to figure things out. On technology, I learned Java, Node and React as I was working with those in the client projects."", 'Irene: Both summers I got to work with new tools that I had never used before.  In addition to the technical stuff, I gained practical skills in working in a group, public speaking and communication ‚Äî all of which are essential skills in the working life.', ""Niklas: I didn't know much about AWS before joining Futurice but got to learn that during the summer. As I mentioned earlier, learning about the intersection of data science and business as well as about both of those individually was a great learning experience for me."", 'Joel: Due to constantly working with senior designers in projects that were about complex and varied topics, I don‚Äôt think that I ever had a time when I didn‚Äôt learn anything. I learnt a lot about communication, design methods, various new software and project management. I also learnt to be relaxed when working with clients.', 'Antti: I like that Futurice encourages people to learn and do new things instead of having a strict job definitions and roles. I stayed at Futurice after my summer job which is a great opportunity to start your career.', 'Irene: If you‚Äôre considering applying to Futurice, just do it ‚Äî even if you don‚Äôt end up getting the job, touching up your CV, LinkedIn and GitHub won‚Äôt be time wasted. It‚Äôs a good idea to go through a mock interview with a friend to prepare for the most common questions. But in the end, the recruiters are looking for a coworker, not just a pair of programming hands, so try to relax and show your personality.', 'Niklas: It was great that there were lots of opportunities to experience things outside just development and data science work. Sports, team events, a great community of professionals and the annual Futucamp which was organized in Tampere this year with Futuriceans from all offices around Europe spending a few days together.', 'Joel: Gather up your portfolio and go for it! For us designers there might be a little more competition out there but I assure you it‚Äôs worth the shot.

How would you expand your thinking in order to design complex projects for complex future environments? At Futurice, we create technological solutions for a future world. Sometimes we are the first to explore and try to solve a particular problem, so there are no references to look at. Solving the kinds of problems we encounter requires a deep co-operation between design, technology and business. ', 'The definition of art is controversial. While technology today can democratize the creation of images, for example, and machine learning can assist us in many creative functions, the power of creative thinking is still of vital importance.  As a company, we‚Äôre known largely for the tech-related work we do, but we also have approximately 100 designers working in-house and we collaborate with external artists. In the context of technology, we can use art as a tool to communicate with the world and to challenge the world as we know it.', '‚ÄúHuman Robot. Moving Robot‚Äù is one of our artistic interventions. The project first saw the light of day in March 2019 for Futures Day. In August of the same year, workshops were held at Annantalo, a multidisciplinary arts centre for children and young people in the heart of Helsinki. This month it‚Äôs a part of LIFT Helsinki 2019 festival at Kaapelitehdas.', 'I first met contemporary dancer Iina Taijonlahti at Helsinki Design Week 2018, where the Futurice robotics crew experimented on what having a discussion with a robot is like and how it feels to play a robot in a discussion. Taijonlahti invited me to lunch and I was immediately sold on her idea of dancing with Momo. Together with Taijonlahti and Futurice Robotics, we created a workshop where Momo teaches people to dance while at the same time teaching them about machine learning. At the end of the workshop Taijonlahti and Momo perform a dance from the future. For us, this has been a journey to stretch our thinking and develop new points of views.', 'The ‚ÄúHuman Robot. Moving Robot‚Äù workshop has visited Annantalo Children‚Äôs future laboratory twice now. Pirjetta Mulari, head cultural producer at Annantalo, says that art as a method offers an interesting and tangible way to approach and handle technological topics. And dance as a form of art is something that everybody can participate in. According to Mulari, the groups participating ‚ÄúHuman Robot. Moving robot‚Äú - such as the visitor groups from Korea and Japan, who came to Finland to study how arts and culture education has been formed in the city of Helsinki for primary school -  felt they were experiencing something totally unique.', 'Mulari feels that we need experiments like this - especially with young people. Artistic methods allow us to further explore the experience after the workshop. For example, a group of Annantalo‚Äôs own art students, who had participated in a workshop, continued exploring the topic of the robot further in the form of fine art - by making collages of robots.  Could this inspire the future robotics designers to come up with more explorative designs for machines? Perhaps we see the rise of biodegradable robot parts or robots imitating other natural forms, not just the human?', '', 'Some of the groups that participated in the workshops were students studying completely different domains, but as Taijonlahti observes: the process is there. The time spent together in the workshop might be limited, but people continue getting insights afterwards. The experience triggers something in people‚Äôs minds and one day, perhaps months or years later, it will help them come up with a creative solution.', 'Art is a tool to craft the unknown. According to Taijonlahti there is the idea of surrendering yourself to the unknown. The workshop context is always exciting since unexpected things tend to happen. What is interesting is the change of agency. When you work with a robot, there is a script, and then there isn‚Äôt. When everything is programmed, you are still giving up your control and ‚Äòyou‚Äô as such are no longer the central focus of the activity. You need to see the unexpected as an opportunity. Ask yourself: How do we work our way out of this one? This will lead you to master the unknown by surrendering to it.', 'Taijonlahti finds the similarities between the terminology used in choreography and in computer science interesting. We talk about components, time, transitions, etc. Some choreographers - such as William Forsythe - use methods in their work that could be described as very algorithmic. By using dance as a method, we can set ourselves outside the screen, explore things through and with our body. Trying out things physically makes the abstract concrete. When we look at things from another angle, we get new insights and might bring something new into the things we do, such as visual design. One can also take a deeper dive into the matter at hand.', 'We craft the future together. Art can build a bridge between the disciplines. In the ‚ÄúHuman Robot. Moving Robot‚Äù workshop people coming from different domains found a shared language when they started discussing ‚Äúcraftsmanship‚Äù and the role of crafts in the future. - What are the professions of the future and how we crafting different materials could work our way together towards a future we desire?', 'The design domain has gone through a lot of changes over the last 20 years. From the era of hero designers, we have been moving to success-stories featuring multidisciplinary teams. Working with multiple international companies during my 20+ year career in design, I have witnessed both approaches. So how to overcome artistic pitfalls? The key lies in understanding context and situation. When am I serving the customer and when is the right moment to execute something I feel I as a person need to bring to this world? When building bridges, we must question our egos as artists.', 'We need to be able to question our own thinking. We need to be able to come up with creative new solutions.

Our playful approach with its utilising toy cars makes the buzzwords more real, something you can get excited about and, most importantly, learn by doing.', 'We named our car Markku to honour Markku Al√©n, the Finnish rally legend. He coined the term Maximum Attack to describe his own approach to competition, meaning: drive as fast as possible, without limits. We altered the term ever so slightly to Maximum AIttack, which is also our Twitter handle.', 'To learn more about Markku.ai, you can visit the page, but to put it briefly, it‚Äôs a car based on the open-source Donkeycar project. We modified it and published several of our own 3D models for the car casing, among other things, as open-source to give back to the community.

We decided to make it public. It all came together at a meeting with S√§rk√§nniemi amusement park (who we‚Äôve been working with), when we decided the race should be arranged at the amusement park. Eventually, we agreed on using the bumper car track as the main arena. It made perfect sense.', 'A total of eight teams ended up enrolling and we realized we were probably organizing the first-ever public self-driving car competition in Finland.', 'The list of teams was pretty convincing:', 'Having made the decision to organize the event/competition, we wanted to make it as epic as possible.

Alas, we were busy installing the track, electricity, seats for the audience and, of course, all the cars and computers. It was quite a handful. There was a lingering sense of uncertainty and fear about how the event would go. Everyone knew that having autonomous cars running around the track had a huge, single point of failure: the cars were autonomous. Any number of variables in the physical world, from the bright sunshine and glossy metallic floor of the venue to the audience and TV crew having their feet near the track, could throw the cars off.', 'We had the cold sweats on a hot day.', 'At the exact moment television cameras turned on and our MC Janne Roihu started blasting his live commentary out of the speakers, everyone realized it‚Äôs showtime and started focusing on their own responsibilities.

There were winners and losers, technical problems, crashes and everything else that you‚Äôd expect, want and demand from a  proper motorsports event.

https://futurice.com/blog/programming-with-state-concurrency,Programming with State: Concurrency,27 Aug 2019,Technology,Some advice on managing mutable state in a concurrent application,"['Invariants', 'Entities and Messages', 'Mitigation in Practice', 'Summary']","['Programming with mutable state is already difficult in a sequential execution model where only one part of the program is executing at one time and functions complete execution without being interrupted. The context of our applications is not so accommodating, though, requiring programs to respond to various asynchronous events. And while some languages, like Javascript, adopt only asynchrony, many languages bring in also concurrency, where many parts of the program might be (conceptually at least) executing at the same time.', '', 'Threads are a common abstraction for concurrency. Since each thread has access to the same program memory, the problems of mutable state get exacerbated. Not only can state now change between function calls, it can be changed by another thread while a function is executing. This problem is typically handled by using locks to prevent multiple threads from operating on the same piece of state at the same time, but locks can be difficult to get right.', 'Looking at the value-entity model from the first post of this series, there are additional problems with multithreading. I mentioned invariants as a useful tool to keep the state of an entity manageable. But since an invariant can be temporarily violated while an entity is modifying itself, a concurrent execution of a state query might observe the inconsistent state. And this leads back to all the problems with mutable state that we were trying to avoid by adopting the value-entity model.', 'Locks internal to an entity can of course be used to ensure that other threads do not see temporary invariant violations. An additional problem to the usual ones in the entity model is that often we want to allow concurrent invocations on an entity that do not conflict with each other, and designing locking to support this can get complicated. Furthermore, a lock-based system only supports those operations that were thought of by the entity implementor. For instance, a common operation needed for an associative array is insert-if-not-present, but if the array only implements operations for checking the presence and unconditional insertion, this combined operation cannot be safely performed by the caller.', 'Software Transactional Memory (STM) is an interesting concept that solves many of the problems in lock-based entity-style programming. The optimistic execution makes non-conflicting operations succeed. The ability to wrap atomic operations into larger atomic operations solves the composability of operations. And finally, when programming with the observable-state model that emits modification events, STM prevents such an event from being emitted before all state modification has completed. STM is not very mainstream, though, so even though libraries exist for many programming languages, it would be difficult to justify its adoption.', 'From the word ‚Äúentity‚Äù, one might expect a different kind of execution. An entity brings to mind something autonomous and separate, but this is not how threaded execution sees things. There are no enforced entity boundaries. Any thread can just come and execute an entity‚Äôs code at any time. What was architecturally good encapsulation in a single-threaded system completely disappears in a multi-threaded system.', 'My preferred system following this thinking would have each entity ‚Äúliving‚Äù in a single thread. All of the code belonging to an entity would always be executed on that entity‚Äôs thread. This is similar to many UI frameworks that require UI component manipulation to happen in the UI thread, except that I would prefer the system to take care of thread switching instead of having to do it manually. Such a system would make programming much more asynchronous, since each entity invocation could involve a thread switch, but I have written code in this style, and it is not too difficult with, say, the async/await mechanism.', 'This kind of view of objects as independent entities that communicate with each other is not new. It resembles Alan Kay‚Äôs definition of object-oriented programming, which is focused on messages between objects. When looking from the concurrency perspective, processes in Erlang function semantically as independent entities with internal state. To me, it is more difficult to conceptualize observable entity state in the message passing model, especially the dependency network of derived state as described in the first post. Still, when concurrency gets involved, I find seeing entity invocation as message passing a better way of comprehending the system in a way that helps make it work correctly.', 'There are some patterns and ways of thinking that can mitigate the problems of concurrency with mutable state. Unlike in the single-threaded case, these tend to be more difficult to set up so that they would work automatically. Therefore more discipline and careful documentation of the used patterns is needed, since the programming environment cannot always enforce it for us.', 'One way to avoid the issues with other threads observing temporarily-broken invariants is to postpone internal state modification. Instead of directly modifying an entity‚Äôs state during function execution, use local variables to capture all the modified pieces of state, and only at the end of execution set the entity‚Äôs state. This also helps when an invocation depends on operations that can fail, since no actual modifications have yet been made so the execution can simply be abandoned instead of having to implement complex rollback logic.', 'This style of state update becomes interesting when the state to update is some form of collection, like an associative array. Fully copying a big structure for local modifications may be too inefficient (but it might not; remember to measure before assuming where your bottlenecks are). A good option would be to use a persistent data structure, which allows the modifications to be made locally in a natural way, swapping the original for the updated one at the end, but persistent data structures are not commonly used in many programming languages. The ultimate expression of this style would be to keep all (mutable) state of an entity in a single persistent data structure, which would eliminate any issues with breaking invariants, since the state would then only get modified all at once in a single operation.', 'When an entity gets more complex, it can be helpful to structure its internals as a state machine, with the state and allowed transitions defining which invocations are permissible. This can also help in concurrent and asynchronous situations. Namely, when the state machine implementation is thread-safe, the check on permitted state transitions can take care that conflicting operations are not executed, even when requested concurrently.', 'Surprisingly, I‚Äôve found that automated tests can be helpful. In general, concurrency issues are non-deterministic, depending on specific timing conditions that won‚Äôt be reproduced exactly. What I do, when applicable, is to run a huge number of threads in the automated test, all hammering on the entity that is supposed to be thread-safe, and verify that the results are consistent with some correct execution. This is not always possible to do, usually the expected result is not as clear-cut as with a traditional test, and the test may not always catch failures. But if the expectations can be defined, I‚Äôve found that running enough threads flushes out many problems reliably enough.', 'Dealing with mutable state in a concurrent program can get very difficult. Concurrency makes it ever more important to architect the program so that state mutation happens only in specific, controlled ways. Building the program directly on low-level concurrency abstractions, as often provided by popular programming platforms, will usually lead to trouble. Whenever possible, try to extract higher-level concepts into reusable components, such as task executors or operation queues. Be even stricter in controlling how state is mutated. And when it is not possible to ensure correct operation through language-enforced mechanisms, be very disciplined and document carefully what is being done and why.']",[]

The AI conversation has been dominated by technical and societal perspectives. \n\nThe commercial dimension needs to take a stronger role in the conversation. ', 'How do we extract business value from AI? What are the relevant commercial models when talking about AI as a corporate asset? How can we use AI to give us a competitive edge? Answers to questions like this can be hard to find and are sorely needed.  AI ‚Äì like all other assets of a company ‚Äì does not possess economic value as such, but is a tool that helps the company generate more money for shareholders, or otherwise prosper now and in the future. Companies that wish to harness AI technologies should strive to understand how their assets are turned into tangible business value and competitive edge in the marketplace.', 'The commercial aspects of AI are not a mysterious or complex ‚Äúblack box‚Äù - something that companies just can‚Äôt crack. The opposite is true: all companies can and should master the extraction of business value from AI. Many of the thoughts and frameworks related to business value and competitiveness that are already widely used by companies are as valid for AI as they are for any other important assets.', 'Business value and economic value are multifaceted and complex concepts, but they can be boiled down to a few key elements:', 'In the real world this picture gets more complex fast, as each element contains dozens of different levers and drivers. Management decisions and actions have an impact on each and every one.', 'In the future, if AI becomes ubiquitous and a kind of  ‚Äúnew electricity‚Äù, an almost infinite amount of ways for extracting economic value will present themselves, in almost all functions, processes and industries of the firm.\nBut today‚Äôs reality is very different. The AI maturity level of most companies is very low, so trying to list all the potential ways to benefit from AI makes little sense at this point.', 'Constructing a simple process for exploring some potential low-hanging fruits and getting to work on them straight away makes a lot more sense. We see it as a three-step process:', '1. What is the nature of your business and the direction you are about to take?', 'Is your business built on cost leadership? Or on relentless focus on satisfying customer needs? Do you go for fast growth in your industry? Or rely on heavy investments in R&D, innovation, product quality or talent? Do you make long-term investments in heavy assets like real estate or equipment? Think about which are the most critical elements of your business in the coming years and how you are planning on generating more value for customers and shareholders?\nThe choice you‚Äôve made can be your starting point in your commercial approach with AI. When exploring opportunities to extract value from AI, you can build on your company‚Äôs current strengths and competitive edge, trying to make them even stronger through AI. Starting with something familiar usually makes a lot of sense.', '\nPotential opportunities and strategies in extracting value from AI', 'Consider the characteristics and drivers of the industry that you are in, too. For example, if your company is in the retail business, you might be able to create commercial value with AI by optimizing advertising, payments and inventory or by predicting consumer demand. These are all critical for your industry. If your business is focused on manufacturing goods to be purchased by other companies, you might bet on using AI in production automation or in the optimisation of maintenance and logistics.', 'So the starting point of your commercial approach with AI can be determined by the nature of your business, the industry in which you operate, your competitive position and the direction your company wants to take in the coming years.', 'Of course, you shouldn‚Äôt focus all your efforts in these somewhat obvious areas. Remember to look to other companies with different market circumstances or objectives for insights, inspiration and best practices. \nKeep in mind that AI is disruptive technology. It might help you change the rules of the game in your industry and allow you to radically rethink your competitive strategy - if that proves necessary or lucrative. So, in addition to emphasising your existing strengths, implementation of AI is also an excellent opportunity to challenge your current thinking and look for completely new approaches in business.', '2. What assets do you have in place and what are your commercial goals?', 'Companies typically develop their AI maturity gradually, moving from one stage to another. First, they realize they have valuable data, data infrastructure and data management processes, nascent algorithms and a decent amount of computing power at their disposal. Then they learn how to develop applications, products and services that harness AI in one way or another. Eventually, companies move towards a coherent C-level management agenda that focuses on fully exploiting AI in practically all operations and functions as well as exploring AI-enabled opportunities to redefine the business the company is in.', 'Like for the first step, here, too, it makes sense to assess the circumstances. What is your current AI maturity level? Do you have data infrastructure, data management processes, algorithms or computing power? Do you already know how to harness computer vision, natural language processing, face recognition, predictive analytics or other AI capabilities? Do you already have products, services or applications that rely on AI? Or a management agenda that aims to maximize the value of AI everywhere in your organization?', 'Now return to step one and look at the nature of your business and your objectives. What do you want to achieve? Revenue growth, cost control, asset efficiency, impactful organization or perhaps repositioning your business?', 'Next, map the two together to see ‚Äúwhat you have‚Äù (your AI maturity) and ‚Äúwhat you want‚Äù (your commercial objectives). The picture below illustrates the mapping exercise. Green highlights exemplary company assets that can be turned into serving the commercial objectives of the firm.', '', 'The mapping exercise helps you identify how your existing AI assets (and maturity) could potentially be turned into commercial value. It also helps you understand where the obvious gaps that might prevent you from making money with AI soon are, and which actions you should take next to fill them. \nIn case of significant gaps between ‚Äúwhat you want‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat you have‚Äù, you should build your commercial approach with AI on existing strengths of your company, rather than to trying to do something that just isn‚Äôt realistic yet.', '3. Which tactics best capture value?', 'Once you‚Äôve done the thinking and mapped out the nature of your business, your competitive edge, your industry, your objectives and your assets, it‚Äôs time to move to selecting more specific tactics that help you to best capture business value.', 'Here again, there are several aspects to be considered. Could you make direct revenues by selling your AI assets to your customers? Or could you increase revenue indirectly by, for example, optimizing your commercial operations? Or could you harness AI in order to get the most out of your other assets, such as fixed or human capital? How about repositioning your company in the marketplace via a disruptive new AI-focused vision that inspires and attracts clients? The picture below lists some of the potential tactics ‚Äúon the menu‚Äù.', '', 'We‚Äôve chosen 19 different tactics that we see firms taking - ones we consider low-hanging fruits and good starting points for many companies. The list is by no means comprehensive, so you might end up analyzing your company and finding new areas of business where AI could be applicable and deliver great commercial value.', 'Please note that the optimal commercial value of your AI assets might be generated as a result of the chosen set of tactics. Some AI-enabled applications or products not only help you generate more revenue, but also optimize ways of working or eliminate unnecessary manual work, which has a positive impact on cost savings. So choosing tactics for your commercial AI approach doesn‚Äôt have to be an ‚Äúeither-or‚Äù choice - it can often be ‚Äúboth-and‚Äù. Combining tactics in a creative way is highly recommended. The maximum impact on competitiveness typically doesn‚Äôt come from point solutions but from a holistic AI approach that caters various value drivers of your firm.\nOptionally, you could create an ‚ÄúAI P&L‚Äù calculation for your company by listing all the relevant AI application areas and the drivers for economic value. The value drivers in your AI P&L could be something along the lines of ‚ÄúBy applying AI in our more intelligent products, we can increase their unit prices by 10% in our business area X‚Äù or ‚ÄúBy applying AI in our knowledge management, we can resource our development projects 20% better next year‚Äù.', 'The final AI P&L of your company is a consolidation of these identified drivers and their estimated business impact.', 'Futurice has worked with many companies, like Supercell, Barona, Exfo, Kesko and many more, helping them build their AI assets so that they can create more commercial value and improve their competitiveness, too.', 'The three-step process presented above is our first stab at demystifying the topic of extracting commercial value from AI.

Few companies have yet understood the extent of the transformation needed when applying AI to business. Commercial opportunities may look lucrative, but the work effort and time needed for results might be overwhelming for many.', 'Companies that have relied on detailed plans, strict targets, corporate rules and incremental change will often find it hard to thrive in the AI age, when business is being run through observation, iteration, prediction and continuous learning based on new data.', 'True improvement in competitiveness requires a big change in thinking, management attention, and dedication and commitment from the organization.

https://futurice.com/blog/programming-with-state-architectural-roles,Programming with State: Architectural Roles,20 Aug 2019,Technology,Principles that make application architecture clearer and help with managing state,"['Architecture with No Pronounceable Acronym', 'Overview of Roles', 'Roles instead of Components', 'Other Architectures', 'Scenarios', 'Summary']","['To me, application architecture has one primary question to answer: Where does this functionality belong? An application I‚Äôm working on is going to have features, each feature consisting of several pieces of interacting functionality. And I want to have a clear view of where each piece of functionality should go, to make sure the components stay comprehensible. The first part of this series described an application as a group of interconnected entities. Now we will look at which entities to create and when.', 'There exist a number of MV architectures, MVC, MVP, MVVM, ‚Ä¶ What these have in common is that the M (model) and V (view) have very clear and limited responsibilities and then everything else apparently goes into the  part. Display formatting of information, accessing the backend over the network, navigating through the application, you name it, the * handles it. And that‚Äôs just not enough for me.', 'Over the years, I have come up with an architecture that works for me. The way that things are split into components makes sense, and I always know how to split up a feature and where each piece of needed functionality goes. I have not tried to force it to form any specific acronym, so it‚Äôs really just my architecture, with components created where they make sense.', 'I also like to separate the connections between components into two different kinds: A dependency means that a component has a reference to another component. And data flow means that a component passes data to another component. Sometimes data flow follows a dependency, when data is passed in to a component whose functionality is invoked. And other times data flow goes in the inverse direction, when a component observes another component‚Äôs state.', 'The diagram shows the useful architectural concepts that I have identified, which I call roles. The data flow between them is shown with arrows pointing in the direction of where the data flows. I have found that mostly, unidirectional data flow works well and makes things easier to understand, since it is always known from where changes can be triggered. Dependencies in the diagram go from top to bottom: something higher up can depend on anything lower down, but not vice versa.', '', 'It is of course necessary to have good definitions of the roles, to serve the goal of knowing where each piece of functionality belongs. View and Resource are the roles that interact with the outside world. A View is whatever draws the user interface on the screen and recognizes user interactions. A single screen often contains multiple Views, usually arranged hierarchically in containment relationships. A Resource is anything interacting with the external world outside of the user interface, from communicating with a backend to file I/O and even to timers.', 'Presentation and Control are both related to the user interface. In the diagram they are marked as view-local, whereas other roles are global. This means that usually each View has its own components to perform these roles, and they are not typically shared between different Views. The reason for splitting these roles is to make the data flow clearer (and unidirectional): Presentation is only concerned with how data is displayed on screen, so the data flow is unidirectional from Store through Presentation to View. And in the other direction, Control only receives user interaction triggers from the View and triggers actions in Store or Agent.', 'The division between Model and Store comes from how state is represented according to the previous post in this series. Models are values, and Stores are entities whose state consists of Model objects. All base state in the application is state of a Store. The Store can acquire this state either from data that flows into it from above, or by fetching it from a Resource, such as a backend or database. The data that flows out of a Store are the Model objects that comprise its state.', 'The Agent role is perhaps the most unusual and also the rarest. The idea behind Agent is that other roles are purely reactive; they do something only in response to data flowing into them, whereas an Agent is allowed to be active, to initiate an action (in a way, the View can also be seen as active, since user actions are definitely not initiated as a direct response to data flow, but user activity is not modelled here). For instance, a periodic synchronization of data with a backend would be an Agent activity, and separating the periodic triggering of the action by the Agent from the actual communication performed by the Store makes the whole system easier to comprehend.', 'The key point in the diagram is that these are not architectural components, they are roles. The difference being, a component may assume multiple roles. When a Model object is shown in the user interface by simply displaying some of its properties as they are, I don‚Äôt bother to create a completely new Model Presentation component but simply let the View directly use the Model object that it acquires from a Store. But when the needed presentation becomes more complex, as it often does, the established separation of roles brings easily to mind the solution of creating a new component for the Presentation role.', 'I place great importance on being able to unit-test as much of an application as possible, and that in part has guided the architecture. The two roles marked as not unit-testable in the diagram are always separate components to facilitate this. For Resources, a test double is always used. Sometimes the double is a stub when the Resource interaction in the test is simple, sometimes a fake to allow more precise control over its behavior. Views are not considered in unit tests at all. All the logic determining what to show is in a Presentation, and all action code is in a Control, so there is no unit-testable logic in a View, only the actual displaying on screen and mapping user interactions to Control triggers.', 'The architecture described here owes a lot to my experiences building mobile applications, and especially to using the popular architectures and trying to fill their ‚Äúdeficiencies‚Äù. For instance, the view-local part of the architecture comes quite directly from MVVM, where the View Model fulfils the roles of Presentation and Control. Experience with MVVM has taught me that these two roles are typically very distinct in a View Model, and for me separating them as concepts makes the whole architecture clearer.', 'Traditionally, the whole functionality contained in the Model, Store, and Resource roles would be contained in the Model part in an MV* architecture. The previous post on values and entities establishes why I like the Model-Store separation, and it is also partly inspired by the Model-View-Controller-Store architecture. The separation of Store and Resource is purely to help with unit testing. By separating the part that in a real application requires interaction with the external world into a thin stubbable layer allows unit tests to cover a lot more of the application than if all the Resource use was contained inside the Store.', 'Navigation is one of the most difficult architectural problems in mobile application development. It is always very simple at the beginning, and can be handled by the Views using the platform native navigation patterns. But too often the navigation patterns of an application become more complex, and they typically do this a bit at a time, never allowing the moment where it‚Äôs clear that the navigation needs to be rethought. The VIPER architecture is the only one I know that explicitly includes navigation, but even there it appears to be only a way to separate the too-simple platform-provided navigation into its own components. The kinds of complex navigation that I have encountered require a more global approach, usually requiring a single component that is responsible for the navigation needs of the whole application.', 'I began with the purpose of the architecture being to determine where each piece of functionality belongs. Thus, the validation of an architecture is performed by observing how well this purpose is fulfilled in development situations. The following two examples show how the functionality in an application screen would be split, and how the role-based thinking allows the implemented architecture to remain simple when applicable and to evolve into something more complex when needed.', 'The component architecture of a very basic screen could look like the User Info Screen example shown below. This is a component diagram, with the roles that each component fulfils shown on the top-right corner of the component. The User Store holds the User model object. The screen shows directly the information in this model object without any additional presentation logic, so the User object can act also in the Presentation role.', '', 'The screen allows editing the user information. In this case no special interaction logic is needed, so the User Store can act in the Control role for the View. Finally, the User Store is responsible for local and remote persistence of the user information, and it uses two Resources for this, one for the local database and one to communicate with the backend.', 'A more complex screen, with more components and more separated roles, is provided by a chat application. The Chat Store is in a way the center point of the application, as it stores all the chats that the user participates in. The Model objects are the messages in the chat, but in this case, a separate Presentation component for messages is needed; for instance, the Model object is likely to store the precise timestamp of the message but the screen should display a more human-friendly representation.', '', 'Depending on how message sending is implemented, there might be a Message Sender component in the Control role that both requests the Chat Store to send a new message from the user and immediately calls the Presentation to update the screen for a better user experience. An alternative would be for the representation of a chat provided by the Chat Store to also provide sufficient information for any pending messages. In general, a separate Control component is useful when a user action requires data to flow into several different components, but it could also be used when the Control functionality is complex enough to warrant testing but is not considered to be the responsibility of a Store.', 'The chat application also provides an example of the Agent role. The Chat Updater is an independent component that could be triggered by a timer, or by external notifications, either one of which would be a Resource. When triggered, the Chat Updater will tell the Chat Store to update a specific chat or all the chats using the Resource for communicating with the chat backend.', 'To summarize the above: I split an application architecture in as many concepts as I feel are necessary. I don‚Äôt feel the need to force them into a cutesy acronym. I use components only when they actually have some necessary function instead of being just a pass-through layer for data, and that‚Äôs why I think in terms of roles instead of components. I find thinking in terms of data flow very useful, so data flow between components is an important part of the architecture. And finally, I‚Äôm not afraid to go against my principles when needed. Not everything fits into neat little boxes, and sometimes it‚Äôs better to just acknowledge that than to try to squeeze a square peg into a round hole. In the end, software architecture should provide guidance, not act as a straitjacket.']",[]
https://futurice.com/blog/programming-with-state-values-and-entities,Programming with State: Values and Entities,14 Aug 2019,Technology,How to think of mutable state in your application to make it more manageable.,"['Values and Entities', 'State', 'Dependencies']","['Developers know well the perils of mutable state in a program. A value changes from underneath you, messing up a computation in progress. Two different places on the screen, ostensibly based on the same information, are not consistent with each other. The application crashes because a value was not changed at an appropriate time.', 'The functional style of programming, which is based on immutable values and functions that build new values instead of mutating existing ones, has become very popular due to the complexity of managing state when everything is mutable.  But let‚Äôs say that we find programming with mutable state useful. For instance, my experience is primarily in mobile app development with the native tools, where the whole platform is built around mutable state, and it is a rare team or company that is willing to go for a completely different app architecture or programming style than is practiced by the majority of developers. The main question then becomes how do we manage that state to keep our programs comprehensible.', 'A view that I‚Äôve found useful is to divide the objects manipulated by the program into two kinds, values and entities. A value is conceptually similar to a primitive type, an immutable object, with a structured value simply a sum of its parts with no hidden content. In contrast, each entity is a distinct object, even from entities with the exact same state. And as an entity has a distinct identity, its state can be mutable.', 'This view conflates equality with mutability, but in my opinion the other possibilities are not needed. An immutable object with a distinct identity can simply be a value that includes a unique identifier. And a mutable object with state-based equality is in my experience just asking for trouble.', 'Languages like C# and Swift have some of this separation at the language level, with the separation of types into structs (values) and classes (entities). But they don‚Äôt go all the way, as both also include an overridable equality for their entity types, allowing a non-identity-based equality to be defined. I feel like this is a holdover from languages where ‚ÄúEverything is an entity‚Äù and has no place in a proper value-entity-separating language. The ‚Äúidentity has a state‚Äù approach of Clojure is much better but we can‚Äôt always program in Clojure.', 'I‚Äôve used the terms ‚ÄúFunctional‚Äù and ‚ÄúObject-oriented‚Äù in the table above, as this is how a programming style primarily based on one kind feels to me. A functional style is based on values, building new values out of pure computations on existing values, whereas an object-oriented style is based on distinct entities having internal state modified by their external interfaces. The rest of this post will be focused on the entity-based object-oriented style relying on mutable state, so I won‚Äôt say more about the pure functional style.', 'Now that the big beast of mutable state has been pushed into these things I call entities, let‚Äôs look at how to manage it. I‚Äôve split state in an entity into two forms, internal and external. It doesn‚Äôt matter much how internal state is managed, as that is local to the entity and can be contained in a small enough area to usually be understandable.', 'For external state, it should make sense as something that is exposed by the entity. Most often, it is better not to simply expose a piece of internal state directly as external state, but provide something more meaningful to the outside world. Or even expose only invocations that can be performed on the entity, whose implementation depends on the internal state but no specific state is ever exposed.', 'Thinking in terms of invariants helps keep the state of an entity manageable. An invariant is simply a property that holds among different parts of an entity‚Äôs state. For instance, in an entity representing a shopping cart, the total price should be the sum of the prices of the individual items minus any applied discounts. While an entity is modifying itself, an invariant can temporarily be violated, but an external observer should always see the invariant to hold.', 'I used the term ‚Äúobservable‚Äù in the table above for external state. This, to me, is necessary to manage the application state properly. It must be possible for other entities to observe changes in an entity‚Äôs state and to react to those changes. In a stateful application, pieces of state are never fully independent of each other, so keeping the complete application state consistent requires modifying many pieces of it simultaneously.', 'Observable state and reacting to its changes introduces the notion of an entity, and its state, depending on the state of another entity. Internally, entities can contain references to other entities that they depend on. And their state can depend on the state of other entities. So there are two kinds of state: Base state and derived state, where derived state is a composition of other state.', 'I find that a good way to manage this is to represent the observable state of an entity as values. Following this, derived state can be defined as a pure function of its dependent state. This is essentially how spreadsheets work, and that is a very useful conceptual model for understanding the complete application state as consisting of independent pieces of base state and dependent pieces of derived state. Entities may contain other entities as internal state but these contained entities are never exposed as external state.', 'To do this properly, the programming language or environment needs to support some form of data binding. Derived state is defined by binding to all its dependencies, with a pure function to compose it. This way the system guarantees that all the state throughout the application is always consistent. This can in theory be also done with the Observer pattern, but as the Observer pattern splits the definition of the state from the update, in practice it can be too easy to forget some necessary update to derived state when the relationships get complex.', 'The Redux architecture shows similar thinking. State changes are performed with pure functions that take the existing state and a performed state-changing action. Redux essentially has only one entity, the store, which simplifies derived-state management. When combined with something like React, where the UI is a pure function of application state, the complexity of state management is significantly reduced.', 'In platforms that encourage the multiple-entity style, derived-state management is not really supported all that well in languages themselves or their libraries. Data binding is usually treated through modification events, which do not function well in, say, the diamond dependency scenario: The state of entity Top depends on the states of entities Middle1 and Middle2, both of which depend on the state of entity Bottom. The correct order to modify the states is Bottom -> (Middle1, Middle2) -> Top, which is followed by any spreadsheet, but a system based on modification events will do Bottom -> Middle1 -> Top, where the new state of Top is computed based on the new state of Middle1 but the old state of Middle2, leading to an inconsistency.', '', 'For large pieces of state, it is not really the best idea to rebuild all depending state from scratch when something little changes. For instance, if the state represents the whole product catalog of a shop service, adding one more product is a very small change that should not trigger massive recomputations. In such situations, I usually include an additional stream of change events. A change event is essentially just the difference between the previous state and the current state, and it has enough information so that any derived state can be modified to match the new dependent state. So when first creating an entity with derived state, a full computation is performed, but afterwards, the derived state is modified in place to reflect changes communicated through the change events.']",[]

But as they increasingly bring big budgets to bear on the problems that matter, and leave behind outdated ways of working, it‚Äôs no longer looking like ‚Äòbig banks under threat‚Äô and more like big banks starting to thrive.', 'HSBC has just opened two data and innovation labs in London and Toronto that will house specialists in areas such as analytics and robotics. Revenue and profit there is up, and they reported investing a billion dollars in the first quarter of the year to enhance digital capabilities. The group has stressed that it will seek to build partnerships and co-develop with firms working in AI. It‚Äôs a similar story at Lloyds Banking Group, currently engineering a ¬£3bn digital transformation.', 'Meanwhile, Moneycorp, a specialist in currency exchange, hedging and international payments saw an opportunity to bring retail banking-style customer centricity to currency exchange and international payments. As a result, the company partnered with my company, Futurice, to co-create a best-in-class international payment platform tailor-made for the digital-first economy.', 'Speed is still an issue though, and digital innovation at most financial services incumbents has lagged behind. Just recently the FCA warned that innovation levels at many banks has been low ‚Äì rejecting the premise that ‚Äúregulatory initiatives and technological developments may cause unprecedented change to business models.‚Äù To some extent, lack of progress among established banks is understandable. A complex web of regulatory, security and compliance issues, combined with legacy IT systems (things we deal with a lot) means attempts to introduce innovation can be an uphill struggle. Everything from dealing with legacy code, through to hiring, reskilling and restructuring workforces can be a lengthy process.', 'Nevertheless, if incumbents are to effectively address the fintech start-up challenge, ‚Äì and make the best use of their advantages more quickly ‚Äì it‚Äôs crucial for them to accelerate the pace of change.', 'The encouraging news ‚Äì as the FCA recognised ‚Äì is that provided they can reconfigure their legacy IT systems, many established banks have strategic and resource advantages over their start up rivals.', 'Based on our experience of working on innovation projects with the likes of Nordea, Moneycorp and VW Financial Services, here are four suggestions for banks trying to accelerate along the innovation journey.', ""Don't start with digital wizardry. This is neither realistic nor practical. Instead, start by talking to customers about the ways they relate to your brand, products and services. Do the same with employees and those involved in delivering these things."", 'Here at Futurice, our tried and tested approach is to zoom in on an individual business problem or subset of problems that are worth solving from a customer and commercial point of view. Having identified the problem, we look at how it can be tackled in a human-centric way and with minimum investment. Taking a pragmatic, lean approach allows innovation teams to demonstrate concrete results early so that the wider company can see tangible benefits. One real life example of what this looks like is the Face Recognition Experiment at Helsinki Airport which Futurice conducted with Finnair and airport operator Finavia.', 'This tightly-targeted, low cost experiment addressed a specific digital transformation issue and positively impacted Finnair and Finavia‚Äôs brand image as customer experience champions and new tech pioneers.', '', 'It‚Äôs important to have a water-tight business case if you want the board to step outside its comfort zone and back innovative digital services. Therefore, the key is to focus on consumer demand and business benefits rather than talking generally about ‚Äúdigital innovation‚Äù or the threat from disruptive start-ups. There also needs to be a high level of engagement with the board or business owners ‚Äì they need a chance to input and be involved.', 'This isn‚Äôt the only ‚Äòhearts and minds‚Äô job however. When it comes to delivering digital innovation initiatives, you also need to be clear about how the business case connects and delivers for different divisions of the bank ‚Äì new business, marketing, customer service ‚Äì  to secure broad-based buy-in.', 'Building consensus is a challenge but it‚Äôs essential. It should include agreeing problem areas, identifying the impact you want to see and for whom (customers, employees etc). The chief digital officer (CDO) will have a key role, mediating between business leaders, many of whom have conflicting priorities. In financial services, or where there is a ‚Äòzero-risk‚Äô operating environment, you also have to ensure the client‚Äôs regulatory and compliance teams are fully engaged in the product development conversation.', 'As the HSBC example shows, transformation can only really happen if the financial services incumbent listens to external as well as internal ideas ‚Äì a concept generally referred to as ‚Äòopen innovation‚Äô. Openness can be introduced in various ways ‚Äì but here are three.', 'Firstly, start moving towards co-creating with customers and third parties rather than top down directives from the board ‚Äì because then you‚Äôll truly know what consumers want.', 'Secondly, be platform agnostic in order to connect with the open source community. This makes it relatively easy to find a solution for a specific coding problem.', 'Finally, collaborate with experts such as consultancies or developers who are actively involved in launching innovative services. Leading Nordic bank Nordea, an Open Banking pioneer, has 3,300 developers registered to test APIs via its Open Banking platform and recently launched its first product to result from the initiative, a reporting tool called Instant Reporting. Similarly our partnership with Moneycorp involved Futurice being embedded in Moneycorp‚Äôs activities, rather than being a siloed and outsourced vendor. This helped introduce a new agile mindset ‚Äì with key benefits including better use of data to analyse and respond to online customer behaviour.', 'Digital technology, competition from Fintech start-ups and changing customer expectations are shrinking the timetable for launching new products and services. What used to take years can now be done in months or weeks.', 'In this context, embracing design thinking and agile processes, allows businesses to innovate and bring user-centred products and services to market more quickly than a conventional R&D set up would allow. To evolve the company‚Äôs product launch strategy, Futurice helped Moneycorp roll out an iterative release process: something we advocate strongly to best in class companies across several sectors. In simple terms, this is about prioritising speed to market over perfection.', 'Perfecting products or services takes enormous amounts of time and doesn‚Äôt always suit a competitive and rapidly changing environment. By focusing on speedy iteration, Moneycorp generated real data with an MVP (a minimum viable product) within months not years.', '', 'As HSBC, Lloyds, Moneycorp and Nordea are demonstrating, introducing innovation into established finance brands doesn‚Äôt need to be the banking equivalent of turning a supertanker.  Start small, open up, build consensus and remember that when it comes to launching an MVP; done, released and learning in the wild is better than aiming for first-time perfection.

For example check-in is the process owned by the airline, the security is owned by the airport, you go to the border and that involves the government. The gate is complicated because that‚Äôs where the airport and airline work together.‚Äù', '‚ÄúSo if you want to introduce a facial recognition service which makes sense for passengers, it needs to cover all these touchpoints. Otherwise you will create duplication ‚Äì  exactly the problem that you‚Äôre trying to solve by creating the facial recognition experience in the first place.‚Äù', 'Duman thinks that this technology could eventually go beyond just the airports and create end to end fully seamless travel experiences.', ""‚ÄúIn the future mobile phones will store our digital identifiers, whether that is voice biometrics, iris biometrics, or facial biometrics. So If I'm travelling from London to Helsinki I would be able to use my biometric ID to unlock experiences throughout the journey.‚Äù"", ""‚ÄúWe're looking at a more connected eco-system in the sense that you could take the train to Gatwick for example, and there'd be a camera in the back of the seat. It recognises you and it starts telling you about your flight, maybe there's a delay you should know about. Or it might prompt you to inform your hotel that you‚Äôre going to be checking in late.‚Äù"", '‚ÄúWe will start to see a more connected experience throughout the entire journey. And one key element here is that biometric data will be owned by its rightful owner, in other words, the end user, and will only be shared on a need-to-know basis.‚Äù', '‚ÄúWhen travel and hospitality eco-systems come together and learn how to share effective data and biometric ID in a way that is respectful to privacy ‚Äì that‚Äôs when we‚Äôll reach the ultimate seamless travel experience‚Äù.', 'The programme also included interviews with other brands using cutting edge technology to take the travel experience to the next level including;', ""Virgin Galactic commercial director Stephen Attenborough telling viewers how his company is on track to take its first paying passengers into space from next year.

Opened in 2018, Oodi is the biggest of Helsinki's 37 public libraries. It has 10,000 visitors a day, and an estimated 2 million visitors a year (compared to Finland's 5.5 million population, that is a significant portion)."", 'Automatic returns\xa0systemThe MiR200 wagon moving books and their\xa0boxesOodi is big on automation and robotics. It has an automatic returns system: customers set their books on a conveyor belt, which brings the books to the basement, where they get sorted into boxes, which are picked up by a mobile MiR200 robot, which brings the books to the 3rd floor. At the 3rd floor, librarians place the books back on the shelves.', 'At the start of our project, we brainstormed how Oodi could use social robots: helping kids learn to read, instructing people on using equipment such as 3D printers, giving information about the library in several languages, and helping people find their way at the library.', 'We eventually settled on a robot that would help customers find the books and book categories they want. Since Oodi is so big, customers have a hard time getting around, and library employees spend a significant amount of time advising people how to find things. But this is not the work librarians are meant to be doing, or want to be doing. Librarians are very knowledgeable about literature. Their expertise is better used in in-depth service, helping visitors find specific books that fit their needs best. This type of work can take 30‚Äì40 minutes. In comparison, ""Where is the psychology section?"" takes 1‚Äì3 minutes to answer. Stacked together, a whole day of 1‚Äì3 minute tasks becomes tedious, and a waste of skills.', 'This is where the robot steps (or rather, rolls) in. A whole day of menial tasks would not bother a robot. We realized we could re-purpose the MiR200 mobile robots that the library already had, and was using to move books between the basement and the 3rd floor.', ""\nThe robot design team: Oodi librarians, Oodi's customers, and Futurice's roboticists"", ""The robot would have the advantage of being able to access Oodi's database directly, and provide real-time information on which books are currently on the shelf. The robot could be more approachable to people who have social anxiety, and are afraid to approach library employees. Additionally, it could save both the customers' time (no need to queue for a librarian), and the librarians' time (who can help customers with more meaningful tasks)."", '\nFirst draft', ""The design team, consisting of Oodi's librarians, Oodi's customers, and Futurice's roboticists, defined some design guidelines for the robot that would be built on top of the MiR200 robot:"", 'The design team decided that the robot should not be too humanoid. We wanted a more abstract form for the robot, with expressive, non-speaking forms of communication. We wanted a design with a bit of imagination and whimsy.', ""The team also wanted to make sure that the robot aligned with Oodi's strategy and policies. The following ethical considerations were underlined:"", 'We started testing the robot at the library, mapping out appropriate routes, and building the user journey. Luckily, we had some very excited testers.', '\nOur voluntary testers', 'The mobile robot by itself was too abstract to form a social bond with people. I wanted to give users something to look at, a sort of face. I searched for mechanical googly eyes online, finding them suitably humoristic, but not too wacky.', 'Googly eyes bring to mind classic animation and comic book characters. There is a relation between robotics design and animation: the 12 rules of animation as defined by Disney have been previously applied to robotics (Ribeiro & Paiva, 2012). In this case, I planned the eyes to follow the rule of ""Exaggeration"". It would be used here to emphasize the robot\'s expressions (looking around to indicate boredom when there\'s a lack of missions), and its actions (looking to the direction it starts moving toward).', 'Luckily, Glen Akins had posted his instructions on how to build mechanical googly eyes online https://bikerglen.com/blog/build-a-pair-of-robotic-googly-eyes/. After much fitting of wires into tiny holes, soldering, laser-cutting, and fussing with power supplies, we had a fresh pair of eyes.', '\nThe making of of some of the googliest eyes', 'The eyes immediately had an effect: I noticed myself looking and smiling at them. When they looked left, I followed their gaze. It is easy to trick a human brain into thinking something is alive if it appears to be moving with intention (Heider & Simmel, 1944).', ""Our team also figured the robot should have some internal drives to make it more social, perhaps even emotions. The coding of emotions, or affective computing, has been previously researched by several universities, namely MIT. MIT's Cynthia Breazeal has researched where in a 3-dimensional matrix a robot's emotions could reside (Breazeal, 2004). I took inspiration from this, and situated the robot's emotions in a 2-dimensional matrix. While a simplification, it was accurate enough for our purposes."", '\nMy crude visualization of the emotion matrix I implemented', 'Emotions are approximated onto two axes: one ranging from negative valence (bad feelings) to positive valence (good feelings), and one from high arousal to low arousal (level of stimulatedness).', ""The emotional state was initialized in the middle of the matrix, at coordinates 0,0. The robot's emotional state moved in the matrix according to events that happened to it. If its mission succeeded, it moved toward positive valence and high arousal. If its mission failed, it moved toward negative valence. If it was unused for long periods of time, it moved toward low arousal."", ""The robot's internal moods affected the way it behaved. The robot's action functions (travel.py and idle.py) queried its emotions at certain points, and changed the robot's sounds, lights, and eye movements accordingly. If it was happy, it would chirp happily when guiding a person to a book. If it was bored, it would try to attract attention by looking around, dancing around and flashing lights (although not too disruptively, this was a library after all)."", ""You might wonder how a user benefits from a sad robot. The answer is, we're not sure yet either. This emotion system is very experimental, and we wanted to explore how it would affect the interactions between the robot and user. We are still collecting data on this as the pilot continues."", 'The code for the emotion system, author me, copyright Futurice, license MIT.', '\nThe robot at\xa0Oodi', 'We tested the robot for 3 days. Customers were able to search for a certain book or author via an open search string, or choose certain book categories to be guided to, such as travelling and cooking. The robot attracted a lot of attention: even when people hadn\'t personally sent it on a mission, they started following it when it was guiding someone else, forming bigger and bigger groups of people following a small robot around the library. Several customers even wanted to pet the robot. Reactions were mainly positive, and surprised (not counting one 60-year-old woman, who declared loudly ""I won\'t try any robot!"" and walked off in a huff).', 'A lot of customers were curious, asking questions about what the robot did, and how it worked. It attracted a lot of children: three girls made a game of taking turns asking the robot to take them somewhere. Others gathered around it in wonderment, exclaiming ""Oh look, it\'s cute!"".', '\nOur robot waiting for users', 'The abstract form of the robot received positive feedback, with its googly eyes being a specific point of admiration. The fact that it was abstract and not human made it more approachable. ""It makes nice sounds, and doesn\'t feel dangerous,"" was one customer\'s comment.', 'Some even talked to the robot itself. A 50-year-old woman thanked the robot after a successful mission, saying ""Very nice, thank you, you\'re wonderful!"". The same woman remarked how smart it was to have a robot showing people around Oodi, since it\'s so big. Another customer cursed the robot out, calling it a ""Creepy McCreepface"", after it managed to sneak up on her. When she encountered it a bit later, she apologized for earlier.', 'Visitors got involved in the future of the robot and had suggestions for improvements, such as having it help in carrying bags, or having a walker support for older people. Some hoped the robot would help them reserve a certain book if it was already checked out, or that it could help them in several languages.', ""I am happy that Oodi's customers had such a positive response to the robot, and adopted it as their own straight away. The robot will be developed further with Oodi. Future versions will utilize the emotion system to a further extent."", '\nA prototype of eyebrows for the robot, which could help communicate emotions more effectively', 'Oodi\'s librarians have sometimes encountered worries from their customers regarding robotics.

I knew there were enthusiastic Clojurians, besides me, within Futurice. But, how were we going to spread our knowledge about Clojure? Youtube videos that no one would watch? Blog posts that no one would read? An answer I got from my peers was to facilitate a workshop.', 'After asking around, it seemed like a plenty of people were interested in joining a Clojure training. Us, Clojure enthusiasts, decided to move forward and start planning it. And off we were! With no material ready, we started planning. Five Clojure enthusiast, and one month of planning.

The workshop seemed successful. 20 people were, hopefully, more knowledgeable about Clojure. Gathering feedback from the participants. Many of them mentioned that they couldn‚Äôt see themselves ever using Clojure in a client project. Disheartening, but completely understandable. There still seemed to be a lot of anxiety and uncertainty about Clojure. The only thing we could do was to improve the material for the training. And try to tackle the uncertainties the people had expressed during the training.', 'The story doesn‚Äôt end here yet! Our Munich office expressed interest in a Clojure training. They had decided to use Clojure, and they wanted to learn as much as possible for their upcoming project. There we were again, spreading the gospel of Clojure. 9 participants, and one really hot working space. It seems that a Clojure workshop can‚Äôt be complete without a hot room. New updated material in hand, we sat, we learned, and we taught again. The feedback from the workshop in Munich was wonderful. 9 participants were less confused about Clojure. It felt like the participants were now much less fearful of Clojure. And the anxiety of this niche technology decreased.', '', 'To summarize: 2 trainings, 29 people participants, 16 hours of learning. End result -- at least half of all the participants would use Clojure more in the future, and some would like to use it in their projects.', 'To answer the question in the title. Learning Clojure at Futurice happens when people, want to spread knowledge, choose it for their project or when they ask question from knowledgeable colleagues. Of course, this is only one of many ways to learn something new and interesting things at Futurice.', 'As mentioned, Futurice encourages learning. Futurice has recently adopted a certificate program. Employees get paid to learn and earn certificate. We see gaining accreditation and certificates as a business-critical necessity, and we run a programme to encourage this. We schedule time, support and offer a financial reward for anyone working to certify themselves with Amazon, Google, Microsoft and other vendors. This might be a longer story for another day.']",[]

Me neither. The robot was created as part of Futurice‚Äôs project with Yle, the national broadcast company of Finland. Yle produces content for TV, radio, and the web. It has a broad reach of older audiences, but has had trouble reaching younger ones. The goal of this project was to use new technology to reach young audiences\u200a‚Äî\u200aspecifically teenagers.', 'Yle‚Äôs content has traditionally been non-participatory: the performers perform, and the audience watches. However, younger audiences generally view content that is more participatory, such as YouTube videos or streams. We wanted to create participatory content\u200a‚Äî\u200athe performer should interact with their audience. Yle‚Äôs journalists specialized in teenage audiences pointed out that gaming and e-sports are popular content. We realized that gaming was the perfect context for this: the audience could play together with the performer. We wanted to explore what an entertainer, or even influencer of the future could look like. So why not create a streaming robot gamer?', '\nYle‚Äôs journalists and Futurice‚Äôs roboticists coming up with the idea of a robot gamer', '\nFirst drafts', 'We chose two games for the robot to play: Flappy Bird and Minecraft.', 'Flappy Bird was a cult game that had a brief period of extreme popularity in 2014. We chose Flappy Bird because the mechanisms of the game are simple, and allowed for the game to be played with machine learning. We wanted to try a neuroevolution algorithm, which evolved new birds into the game based on which birds did best in the previous generation. This way we could see how the audience reacted when a computer was playing the game.', 'We chose Minecraft for its communal features, which allow interaction between players. Players can co-operate or fight each other, trade with each other, and chat with each other. They can ‚Äúgrief‚Äù each other\u200a‚Äî\u200ai.e. be of nuisance. Players can also mine materials, and turn them into items, or even build cities. They can store precious things, farm the land, herd animals, and fight monsters. Minecraft also has a material called redstone, which players can use to build logic. Effectively, players can build an entire computer inside of Minecraft. Poetic, eh?', 'For playing Minecraft, we decided that a human should control the robot. The game is complicated, and having authentic interactions with other players would require a human on the other end.', '\nFlappy Bird and the Robot', 'Our team of Yle‚Äôs journalists and Futurice roboticists defined some clear advantages for using a robot in this context:', '\nTesting our streaming equipment and having problems with interference from the robot‚Äôs face screen.', 'We decided on a six hour gaming session, alternating between Minecraft and Flappy Bird.

We alternated between games: 14‚Äì15 was Flappy Bird, 15‚Äì17 Minecraft, 17‚Äì18 Flappy Bird, then 18‚Äì20 Minecraft again. This schedule allowed the robot operators playing Minecraft to have a much-needed break in the middle.', '\nOur streamer', 'In the beginning, a few people joined. Gradually, we gained more and more people. We reached our peak at 16:20\u200a‚Äî\u200a49 simultaneous viewers on Twitch. Overall, we had 431 unique viewers. In Minecraft, there were around 30 active players. Considering how minimal our advertising was (one forum post and a few tweets), we were pleasantly surprised by the turnout.', 'The Minecraft sessions were directed by two robot operators (me and another Minja). The other Minja played Minecraft, and I operated the robot‚Äôs voice and gestures. A third person was answering messages on chat.', 'Watch a YouTube video on the interaction here', 'Minecraft was overwhelming. The robot‚Äôs provocative character provoked teenagers into repeatedly killing it. After fleeing to the mountains to be with the llamas a couple of times and being killed yet again, we modified the robot‚Äôs behaviour to be more friendly. We wanted to create more constructive interactions.', '\nTwo Minjas as robot operators', 'Toward the end of the second Minecraft stream, teenagers were cooperating with the robot. They protected it from the few aggressive players that were left, and gave it gifts such as flowers. Some even complimented the robot directly, to make it happy. The players started following the robot, agreeing to cooperate when it initiated building a lighthouse. They also built a house, and captured and named a llama: IQ_201 Junior.', 'There were two clear factions in the game: some were intent to kill the robot throughout the entire game, and some protected it throughout. Some became more comfortable with the robot as the stream went on, switching sides. Either way, the robot aroused strong emotions. Teenagers sought out genuine interaction with it. No-one ignored the robot, or was bored.', 'Discussions about how the robot worked were had throughout the stream. No-one asked the robot itself though, maybe out of respect or fear of annoying it. Discussions focused on whether the robot was ‚Äúreal‚Äù, i.e. whether it was truly automatic, or a human was operating it. Was it typing with actual physical hands? Or had it ‚Äúhacked into‚Äù the game and was playing via code?', '16 people responded to our survey afterward. 80% of players were under 18, most were 13 to 15-year-olds. 80% of players interacted with the robot. This was extremely positive, we succeeded in making a robot that was compelling to users. 75% of players rated the robot as 3 or above, out of 5.', '\nViewers over time', 'We collected comments from the players from the survey, as well as the Minecraft game chat. They are translated from Finnish, and reflect some of the thoughts our players had on the robot.', '‚ÄúIt was pretty fun and cool. But it somehow felt like a set-up.‚Äù (Referring to the robot possibly having a human operator)', 'A lot of players were wondering how the robot actually worked. This comment brings us back to the ethical consideration we talked about earlier: transparency about how the robot was operated. Though we intended to be transparent at first, we decided to not inform users of the robot‚Äôs teleoperated nature for this first pilot. We made this choice because we wanted to keep the ‚Äúsuspension of disbelief‚Äù of the user active, meaning that we wanted the participants to play along with the fact they were talking to a ‚Äúreal robot‚Äù (an autonomous robot) (Duffy & Zawieska, 2012). The negative response we received regarding the unclarity on the robot‚Äôs functioning made it clear to us that if this pilot were extended, it is highly important to be more transparent. It is possible to hold suspension of disbelief and be honest of the robot‚Äôs operation simultaneously (we do all know that television shows are not reality, after all).', '‚ÄúThe robot was a bit simple in certain things, and sometimes talked meanly to people, and was condescending. This was a bit anxiety inducing‚Ä¶ Was this intentional?‚Äù', 'Some players felt that the robot‚Äôs rude behaviour crossed the boundary into condescending. They wished that the robot would be more considerate in the future. This indicates that even a robot can hurt feelings. In future versions, making IQ_201 more empathic, and less focused on the superiority of robots over humans, could have positive results.', '‚ÄúThe robot looked a bit blue in the face, and its voice was a bit weird.‚Äù', 'Two teenagers did not enjoy the robot‚Äôs appearance and voice. One remarked especially about it‚Äôs blue face, asking why we did not make it ‚Äúnormal colored‚Äù. This may have been due to the robot falling into the ‚Äúuncanny valley‚Äù for these players. Uncanny valley is a theory developed by robotics researcher Masahiro Mori (Mori et al., 2012). His theory posits that as the appearance of a robot approaches human-likeness, there is a dip when the appearance gets very close. Zombies and corpses fall into this valley. To get rid of this effect with our robot, it could be wise to alter the robot‚Äôs appearance and voice in future solutions.', '\nThe Uncanny Valley by Masahiro Mori. Wikimedia commons.', '‚ÄúIt was really interesting gaming with the robot. :) Hopefully in the future we can have this type of event again. :)‚Äù', 'The majority of the teenagers enjoyed playing with the robot, and watching the stream. Their feedback complimented the robot‚Äôs sense of humour, and its playing skills. A continuation of the pilot would surely find an interested audience.', '(to the robot) ‚ÄúSome people have trouble with new things. In this case, these players are having trouble with a robot, since you‚Äôre new.‚Äù', 'This player consoled the robot in-game, as other players were giving it a hard time by continuously killing it. This comment was moving: the player felt bad for the robot, and thought the robot might feel bad as well, attempting to change that. This is a clear empathic response toward the robot.', '(to the robot) ‚ÄúI will miss you robot!‚Äù', 'A few players gave the robot heartfelt goodbyes when it left Minecraft. These players found the robot approachable, and even formed an emotional bond with it. This means we succeeded in creating a compelling character, even during what was only a 6 hour stream. For future builds of the robot, the players should be informed how the robot operates. This could help them calibrate an appropriate level of emotional bond to the robot.', 'Players took an active interest in the robot. They approached it, interacted with it, and formed opinions on it. The robot also provoked emotional reactions\u200a‚Äî\u200aboth positive and negative. Some participants really loved the robot and wished for more interaction in the future, and some were heavily critical. This indicates that robot influencers have the capacity to affect our emotions\u200a‚Äî\u200awhether this capacity will ever reach the level of human entertainers, I do not know. Whether that is desirable, I also do not know.', 'What positively surprised me was that the young user base of the robot were media literate: they critically examined the robot‚Äôs mode of operation. The players had a good idea of what is possible with AI today, and what is not. They were not easily duped.', 'This makes me hopeful for our future, whether it contains robotic entertainers or not. When viewers remain critical, they can understand that robots are machines with no actual emotional capacity, even if viewers do choose to suspend disbelief. Interacting with the robot can be though of as a form of parasocial interaction for the viewer\u200a‚Äî\u200awhere the viewer may feel that their relationship with the robot is close\u200a‚Äî\u200aeven though it is not truly reciprocal. This in itself is not necessarily harmful, as long as we are honest about what the relationship truly is.

At the same moment, sales were going down. The answer turned out to be a whole network of services and the result is good for everyone involved: users get a better product and ecosystems created more than $60 billion in revenues.', 'This is a fundamental element of an Ecosystem of Services. When carmarkers started this strategy, being able to share knowledge between the different pieces was crucial.

It was the conscious effort to break down those barriers and finally build better relationships - not only between the services but with other industries, the users and people inside the offices ‚Äì that did the trick. Now every part of the ecosystem works in symbiosis and constant collaboration with the rest.', 'Modularity is about creating easily composable elements that work in synergy. In the case of ecosystems, we are talking about how each service creates value by itself and increments its efficiency when composed with other services. Every piece of information collected from the other services in the ecosystem improves the creation of new ones, which leads to the discovery of highly standardized methods for creating high quality digital products.', 'If you take a close look at the digital services in 2030, you will find all these components running and improving every second.

The construction of new technologies needs people across multiple disciplines, in order to understand from multiple perspectives exactly what is needed build ethical applications. I hope the documentary, and this blog post, rouse your interest to explore the topic further.', '\nImagine a 1st grader in place of the photographer', 'The interactions were set up as follows: we booked a 2 hour slot one morning from a school in Helsinki. Kids wrote questions for the robot beforehand, so the operator (me) could examine them, and prepare accordingly.', 'The morning of, we set up the robot in the school‚Äôs gym. The gym had a stage surrounded by curtains, where the robot and child were to meet. Cables ran from behind the robot to behind the curtains, all the way to the operator‚Äôs computer. I sat behind the curtains at the computer, manually typing in what the robot said to the children (thank you 10-year-old me for playing that computer game that taught me how to type with the ten finger system). I also had a few buttons to press for the robot‚Äôs gestures.\nChildren met the robot one by one. At the end of our time slot, around 8 children all came to interact with the robot at once, so everyone could have the chance to meet it.', '\n*8 excited children‚Äôs feet as seen by the robot operator\n*', 'I left the interaction having met all the children, but not really. The children were meeting a robot.', 'Robot: ‚ÄúDo you think robots and humans are similar?‚Äù \nChild: ‚ÄúNo‚Äù \nRobot: ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù \nChild: ‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre not made of metal. The humans, they‚Äôre not made of metal.‚Äù', 'What I learned during my brief existence as a robot:', 'Children approached getting to know the robot like they would approach a new friend. They asked it what its favourite food was, if it had friends, what its family was like. Robot-specific questions ‚Äî like what was the square root of a gigantic number ‚Äî came later. In essence, children were extending empathy to the robot, treating it like an equal. This is positive: the children didn‚Äôt have impulses to treat the robot unfairly. This human tendency for empathy toward robots has been shown and discussed in previous studies (Darling et al., 2015; Scheutz, 2011). This is an interesting design question: what types of robots do we want to design, given that we feel empathy for them my default?', '1st graders were young enough to have great suspension of disbelief. They had a willingness to believe that the robot was actually alive. Not one of them said out loud that they thought that a human was operating the robot, nor connected my sitting at the control computer behind the curtain with the robot. The presence of fiction and fantasy in human-robot-interaction, and its effect on the design choices of the roboticist, has been previously discussed (Duffy & Zawieska, 2012). What degree of fantasy is useful to the user? What degree of fantasy is ethical to preserve?', 'Some kids were shy, and some were not. It would be interesting to see whether the children who were more shy toward the robot, are also shy toward humans. Do they relate to robots in similar way as to humans? Do children approach robots in the same way they do unfamiliar humans? Are they suspicious of them? How about adults? The larger discussion around this topic is if we can affect the general level of trust toward robots by varying design parameters of the robot, how should the trust be calibrated for each application?', 'Robots could be more suitable for select users. One conversation in particular stuck in my mind for days after. It was the one prominently shown in the documentary‚Äôs opening shots. The child in question was open to talking about what they thought was the difference between humans and robots, what made robots robots, and what made humans humans. The fact that while robots live forever until they‚Äôre turned off, humans need freedom from life. Interestingly, the child‚Äôs teacher remarked that this child did not typically stand out in a traditional school environment. Something about the robot engaged the child differently than a class atmosphere. This points to the potential of robots being efficient learning tools for different types of learners.', 'As final words, I am happy to see critical evaluation of robotics and its applications. Here is what I could glean from the short yet valuable interactions of the first graders and a robot.', 'I hope the sinister hypothetical sci-fi threats of AI and robotics ‚Äî while concerns that should be acknowledged and steered away from as our future ‚Äî should not stop us from building useful and beneficial applications today.', 'Darling, K., Nandy, P., & Breazeal, C.

There are a lot of shelves at Oodi. Finding a particular book or a category is not a trivial matter for a customer, and often requires employee assistance. It may also, in fact, be tricky for the employee.', 'Romeo Pulli, project manager at Oodi, suggested that we should make use of their MiR robots and extend their abilities for the social interaction. This makes a lot of sense, as the MiR wagons move reliably and had already been tested to navigate around in the public space.

It only saw around itself on that very low level. A chair with thin legs might go undetected, as the bulk of its volume is too high for the robot to detect. This would result in moving chairs, as the powerful robot will try to plow through the chair.', 'Later in the project Veera was equipped with a lift module that doubled its size. It also got extra depth cameras angled upwards. We noticed a shift in generic attitude towards the robot. The sharper edges and larger bulk clearly made it a bit less approachable to some people. The new side-placement of the kill switches fortunately deterred the toddler attacks.', ""\nWith the lift module Veera didn't look like a toy anymore, photo by Futurice, CC BY 4.0"", 'The prototyping meant several weeks of piling Python code upon Python code, extensive use of curl to study the robot and library system APIs, soldering wires and assembling stepper motor setup for the eyes with the driver boards, writing Arduino sketch code for the eyes, configuring a Linux laptop to run it all, sleeping way too little, badly calculating battery power to run it all, throwing together a Flask app to show the user interface, moments of despair integrating to the complex cloud-based library system, testing, testing, testing, and most of all commanding Veera around the library, studying and adjusting its path choices.', 'We made a simple emotions library for the robot.

Some adults were not amused by the robot. It scared a few people a bit, taking them by surprise. Veera sneaked upon a young lady browsing books and she called it a creepy-ass Creepy McCreepface. She apologised to the robot afterwards, when they met again.', 'These encounters could mostly be avoided by audio design, having the robot emit enough sound to alert people to its presence.', 'The library staff were happy with how these efforts turned out. Combined with the primary function of carrying books, and possibly doing automatic inventory at the slow hours of the night, a lot of valuable work could be performed by a few MiR robots. Seeing the value in this, we agreed to continue the project and are now designing and building for an extended pilot, where the robot will operate autonomously for several months.', 'This continues to be a fascinating research project for us, and furthers our understanding of how people and robots can and should interact in social situations.', ""A similar setup could work well in large department stores, airports, hotels, or other locations were people need to be guided around to find items and places.

We've spent a while working on a microservice-based backend, and I think it's time to share what we've learned."", '', 'First, it\'s important to understand who I\'m talking about when I say ""we"". We are the Finavia DevOps team. We\'re a team of eight people: five developers, two designers, and one account manager. Collectively, we develop, maintain and operate the following on behalf of Finavia:', '...as well as the backend system that ties it all together.', 'We also work in close collaboration with the team that maintains and develops the Finavia website.', ""So now before I really get into things, I'm going to tell you a story. It's going to be a story of how things used to be before we moved into the land of milk and honey and microservices."", ""In the past, there was once a backend server named MOBA, short for Mobile Application (Gateway). Its job was to support the airport's mobile application which was at the time, three mobile apps, one for each platform (iOS, Android, Windows Phone)."", 'MOBA was originally written in 2012. In 2016, when mobile application development moved from three native applications to a single cross-platform iOS & Android application, MOBA was forked, and all development proceeded on the newly-christened ""MOBANew"". The original MOBA remained in order to support the Windows Phone application.', 'For its entire lifespan, MOBA never had a test environment. The process of deployment was fraught with difficulty; manual and fragile, the project\'s readme included a 12-step process. Step zero was ""try to do it at a time when no flights are going out"", because deployment involved bringing the backend down. If the backend was down when a flight\'s status changed, those push notifications would never be sent. Not ideal.', 'As part of the work on the new cross-platform application, our client expressed a desire to be able to take payment and allow users to create accounts. Because MOBA\'s architecture was, as one former team member described it to me, ""spaghetti-like"" at the time, the decision was made to do that work as part of a separate service.', '', 'Enter Payment Service Core. Pitched to the client with the diagram above, its goal was primarily to be able to take payments in order to allow users to reserve parking spaces at the airport.', ""The idea was that it would be a microservice-based backend, where each microservice would communicate with each other over HTTP via RESTful APIs. The decision was made to write it in .NET 4.5 and C# instead of MOBA's Java for two reasons: first, one of the client's requirements was that it must run on Windows Server 2012. Second, it had to able to live up in the cloud, as there were distant plans to move away from physical servers to the cloud. We knew .NET Core was coming, and would be cross-platform and cloud-friendly, so .NET seemed like a natural choice."", 'Work began on May 11, 2016, and the first phase was completed by the end of October 2016. At the time, there were eight services: Payment, Authentication, Order, Email, SMS, Invoice, Mobile App Gateway, and User.', 'Payment Service Core had a few driving philosophies. One of its most important was automation. Everything had to be automated from day one: testing, building, and deploying. In addition, each individual microservice had to be able to be updated and deployed independently. The goal was to be able to add features and fix bugs both quickly and safely. None of us wanted a return to the days of copy-paste deployments, and timing deployments to avoid push notification interruptions. One of the oft-quoted targets was that we wanted a deployment process so simple, our product owner could do it.', 'The reality of this was a roaring success. Once everything was up and running, we had the capabilty to make multiple deployments to production daily. We even had enough confidence in our infrastructure to be able to deploy on Friday evenings without fear of weekend-ruining phone calls!', '', '(In the slides, I had a super-cool animation where each of these appeared one by one. Alas.)', 'Today, our process is still heavily automated.', 'It begins with a developer (let\'s call him ""Neil"") writing code. Once he\'s done with his feature, or bug fix, he pushes his branch up to our repository in GitHub and opens a pull request.', ""Our build machine automatically sees this, and our Azure DevOps agent automatically builds the branch and runs our test suite on it. If it passes the tests, and another team member's review, Neil merges his code with the master branch."", 'Next, our CI (continuous integration) tool (Jenkins, at the moment) builds all the microservices that this pull request changes, and sends the built artifacts out to our CD (continuous deployment) tool (Octopus Deploy, at the moment) which will automatically deploy those changes to our test environment.', 'Finally, after some testing in the test environment, maybe a few rounds of bugfixing, and validation from our client if necessary, we decide the changes are ready to go live and press a shiny ""send to production"" button in our CD tool. Done!', '', ""2016 sees the release of the new cross-platform mobile application. Payment Service Core is so successful that new feature development continues on it, rather than MOBA. As we enter 2017, Payment Service Core is handling a wide enough variety of things that we drop 'Payment' from its name and begin just calling it Service Core."", ""It's also around this time that .NET Core 1.1 is released and, after some time evaluating it, we make the call: we're ready to migrate. We decide to do so for two reasons: first, the aforementioned cross-platform capability that will let us run more easily in the cloud. Second, we get all the shiny performance improvements that come along with .NET Core."", 'We start migration work on May 2nd of 2017. Our decision to follow a microservice approach immediately pays off here, because we can begin migrating our services one-by-one, starting with the less mission-critical ones first. This allows us to take a measured, incremental approach to upgrading. We can find all the pitfalls, the footguns, and the landmines in small doses before we commit to upgrading our more important services.', ""A little over a year later, migration work is completed; every service is running on .NET Core. We weren't just upgrading during this time of course. We were also developing new features and fixing bugs in all the other services!"", ""As for the process of upgrade itself, it wasn't that bad! Our first service upgrade took about two weeks of cautious experimentation and reading of documentation. By the time we migrated the last few, we could migrate one of our services in about two hours."", 'Our biggest pain points were the following four:', ""In the process of building and maintaining Service Core over the last three years, we've learned some things about microservices, which I will now present as gospel truth."", ""The first is that microservices bring about more inherent complexity. Instead of having a single thing you build and deploy and run, now you've got eight, or twenty, or a hundred. And all of these services need to have a way of talking to each other. And now you need to have some kind of infrastructure to build and deploy them, because there's no way you'll manage copy-paste deployments on a hundred tiny services."", 'For similar reasons, debugging multiple services simultaneously is complex. Instead of just hitting F5, now you need to make sure that all your locally-running services are talking to each other (and all actually running locally...).', ""A lot of the complexity of your backend is going to move, but it isn't going to go away. Microservices tend to have the advantage of being simple, because they only have a single responsibility. But now you've got to manage the complexity of a build system, and a deployment system, and figuring out how to make all these tiny little things talk to each other."", 'Finally, and this is a bit of a recent speed bump for us, but sharing code without duplication is hard! For a long time we had a single ""Core"" library that all the microservices used. But more recently, what if we had code that we wanted to share between only, 2 or 3 or 4 services? The solution, as it turned out, was just ""write another library project, and only reference it in the 2 or 3 or 4 services that need it"". But that\'s not something you even need to consider in a monolith-style project.', 'So more broadly, what else have learned in our time developing and operating Service Core? Lots of stuff!', ""Automation was, and remains hugely important. Write tests! Make it easy to run those tests! Make things easy to build and deploy! Then make a robot do it, because you've got better things to do."", 'One big advantage of microservices is ""swappability"", which is a word I just made up. In practice, it\'s easy for us to swap out implementations under the hood with very little disruption. At one point, our client\'s contract with their old SMS provider ran out, and we had to swap to a new SMS provider on extremely short notice. We switched out the implementation under the hood of our interface, and redeployed the service. Users were none the wiser.', ""This one might get me tarred and feathered a little bit, but mono-repos are better. There's a story here: we actually started with a one-repo-per-microservice setup. Then, we had a developer join the project, and spend a month working on a new feature that had concerns across multiple microservices. When the time came to merge it in, he had a massive pile of merge conflicts. Turns out that for several of the services, he'd been working on code that was months out of date. It took a week to sort out all the merge issues. Shortly after that, we moved to a mono-repo and things have been lovely ever since. (Although do note: before the performance improvements brought by .NET Core and more recent versions of Visual Studio, opening up the big multi-project solution hurt.)"", ""You need good logging. Need it! You've got requests coming in and wandering willy-nilly across any number of independent little microservices. Unless you've got a tool that can track a request from start to finish, you don't have a chance of tracking down what happened when something goes wrong. Or when something happened at all!"", ""Predicting more tar and feathers in my future: if you can't deploy on Friday, you're doing it wrong."", ""The Boy Scout approach (leave things better than you found them) applies to more than just cleaning up code. It applies to infrastructure, it applies to project upgrades. When we were in the midst of our upgrade-to-.NET-Core frenzy, we had a rule: if you touch a project and it hasn't been upgraded, congratulations. You are now in charge of upgrading it."", ""Being able to (safely!) use the latest technology is really very nice. Because we can upgrade one little piece at a time, it's extremely easy for us to track the latest versions of the technologies we rely on and get all the fun new features. (Incidentally, we have an open PR in the repo waiting for .NET Core and C# 8. Very excited for C# 8's nullable references feature)"", 'From its humble beginnings as Payment Service Core...', '', '...Service Core has come a long way:', '', 'Today, there are 35 distinct services (only 28 of which are shown above due to NDA reasons). We add a new service at a rate of about one a month or so.', ""We've got 150 individual projects (defined as a .csproj-plus-files), all of which are written in C# 7, and running on .NET Core (or .NET Standard) 2.x. We're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, and most of our projects are just Web API projects (though we do have two React SPAs served by ASP.NET Core)."", 'We are currently rewriting (almost done, in fact!) an older Scala backend in C# and bringing it into Service Core. Previously, Service Core talked it, but it was very much its own beast. In the process of the rewrite, it got split into about 3 individual microservices, all with their own clearly-defined responsibility.', '', ""I did promise some Azure talk, didn't I? Let's talk about Azure."", 'Azure powers our entire test environment. Every microservice gets a dedicated App Service app. Despite running in very different environments, our test and production environment are as identical as possible. In practice, when testing and developing, the only difference is in data sources.', 'Azure also powers our logging system (which I will talk a little more about shortly). It also powers our alerting, both for test and production, even though our production environment is ""physical servers provided by the client"".', ""Azure DevOps also runs our tests on every GitHub PR (every commit to the PR, in fact!) via the new GitHub Apps feature. We're even considering migrating from our current CI & CD tools to hosted Azure DevOps, so we don't have to manage our own VM, and Jenkins and Octopus Deploy instances anymore. Still waiting on a few features currently in preview, though."", '', 'Have I mentioned that you need good logging? I think I have. Maybe.', 'We use an Azure service called Application Insights for all of our logging needs. And profiling. And failure analysis. And... you get the picture.', ""Application Insights is a log aggregation tool with a slick UI in the Azure Portal that's able to track everything your backend does. We have it set to track every request, exception, log entry, and call to external dependencies. It allows us to find an individual request, and drill down to see exactly how long it spent doing what."", ""It also has a sister tool named Log Analytics, that allows you to query and visualize the actual raw data that Application Insights uses. We've used this to do things like measure performance characteristics of our flight-information service, and graph that over time, to measure if code changes we were making were having an impact on performance."", ""The best part is that all of this works even if you aren't running on Azure--we use it in both our test and our production environment, even though our production environment is running on very non-cloud physical hardware. Application Insights provides SDKs for major platforms/frameworks, and for those that it doesn't, there is also a REST API."", ""So what?

https://futurice.com/blog/the-humble-coffee-shop-experience,The Humble Coffee Shop Experience,9 May 2019,Innovation & Design,A look at the future of the coffee shop customer experience. ,"['United States of Coffee Shops', 'Death Knell of a Cash Register', 'Portable Point-of-Sale', 'Borderless Retail', 'Biometrics, Zero-UI, and Progressive Enhancement', 'Weighing Data', 'From Bean to Cup', 'Summary']","['As a regular visitor to coffee shops, I observe a lot of different approaches to the customer experience. Some are far more practical than others\u200a‚Äî\u200amy approach to service design often leaves me deep in thought on how to improve each and every coffee shop. The following is an outline from a CX-oriented software project\u200a‚Äî\u200autilizing deep learning\u200a‚Äî\u200awhich began in 2011 and is still under active, iterative, improvement in 2019.', 'The traditional coffee shop often shares similarities with many other retail experiences: it all starts with one or more fixed cashier stations, some still with mechanical cash drawers. Although there‚Äôs a certain performance art in the craft behind coffee shops (i.e. the barista preparing the coffee), the experience still revolves around the standard retail point-of-sale.', 'To update the point-of-sale with new product items can be quite cumbersome and\u200a‚Äî\u200adue to the nature of retail\u200a‚Äî\u200asuch point-of-sale (PoS) systems tend to result in queues which slow, and sometimes stop, the customer experience entirely. Some coffee shops have even abandoned the point-of-sale for a simple card reader with manual input per transaction. For coffee shops the point-of-sales are also often positioned near where coffee and food is prepared and distributed, making the structure altogether chaotic and haphazard at peak times.', 'The orders placed at the traditional point-of-sale in a coffee shop is typically shared verbally, physically (with a receipt), or occasionally electronically with the kitchen staff and baristas, if these roles are separate. The queue is processed one-by-one, sub-optimally, regardless of how busy or sedate the caf√© is.', 'At the end of the day, the till receipts are calculated, physical cash is tallied, and a balance sheet, in one way or another, is updated so that the caf√© management can see where the sales trends are, and what stock is needed. This often ignores waste and training stock, which are typically forgotten about.', 'With the most modern PoS solutions, such as Square, you can see how the trends move throughout the day. None of this data however enhances the customer experience, nor does it significantly improve the running of a modern coffee shop. At this point we‚Äôre gathering swathes of data and none of it impacts the customer experience (CX) at all. The focus is on the bottom line of the balance sheet only, and opaque data like this rarely provides us with valuable insights we can use to grow a business.', '\nVibrant coffee shop with cluttered products surround their point-of-sale', 'So how do we update the modern coffee shop, or any other retail model, to deliver a modern customer experience that drives better sales and improves our product? We may have some data, disconnected from the customer experience, and we may have an endless supply of customers producing untapped, hidden, discrete data every day.', 'Our first instinct is often to start with the point-of-sale system, as it‚Äôs so pivotal to the experience. However, if you take a step back and look at the service industry from a consumer perspective we can start to experiment with service design focused around the mobile experience instead. The mobile is a single, personalized device focused on the individual consumer with ready-to-use data and a delivery model for new experiences.', 'Our goal in this instance is to drive more consumer sales interactions by developing an elegant and fluid personalized user experience (UX) oriented around location-based information that could introduce consumers to new independent coffee shops; we start with an app.', 'Our app\u200a‚Äî\u200ain this instance\u200a‚Äî\u200ais map-oriented and allows coffee shops to list their location and details so consumers can find them more easily. It‚Äôs not dissimilar to other mapping apps, like HERE or Google Maps, but it‚Äôs domain focused, with features specific to the coffee market.', 'Once we designed the mobile app we wanted the coffee shops to be able to update their menu each day and even allow a stock check to happen within the app so consumers can see what is available before they commit themselves for a lunchtime treat. This can be much easier than a point-of-sale by simply developing a modern UX with the optional ability to add integrations into platforms like Square or Shopify, which are commonly used in retail.', 'This new approach is a significant reset to the short-vision approach of going sales-centric, where we now start with a service design-oriented approach from the mobile experience. The smartphone has become ubiquitous and enables new concepts to arise that will inevitably lead to the removal of the (physical) point-of-sale altogether (see Apple brick-and-mortar stores for an indication of how this will look), as consumers take control of their buying experience.', '\nCoffee shop with narrow retail space and single point-of-sale', 'Starting with the smartphone enables us to provide a personalised experience by picking up small data from each individual at every step of their experience. Firstly, we utilise the location of the customer using the ubiquitous location services from any smartphone; we can identify which coffee shops they visited, and when, including how long they stayed, using basic geofencing (a.k.a. GPS). That enables us to profile the customer based on their habitual preferences. We could use this to notify the customer if unique or new products become available at their favorite locations and then identify if they then visited that location shortly after being notified. This enables a type of conversion checking for coffee shop sales. Consider this a validation metric for the coffee shop itself.', 'When a customer arrives at a coffee shop we can pick up their current menu and offers. Using notifications we can push this information to participating customers (local customers with the app installed) which enables them to place an order quickly with all of the relevant information at their disposal. Already the customer is better informed, sales are easier to make, and the coffee shop can start seeing a more personalised, even if anonymous, overview of their customer behavior, which no point-of-sale is able to provide.', 'The orientation of the CX is much more personally aligned at this point, but it‚Äôs still not without (huge) gaps. So how do we fill those?', 'We start by enabling payments from mobile devices. With the ability to see an updated menu on their device, the customer can now construct their order before they even get to the cashier. We utilise that to provide the payment service so that the customer could simply show their order, and confirm it has been paid at the cash register\u200a‚Äî\u200afor now\u200a‚Äî\u200abefore taking their seat. This rapidly increases turn-around times for participating customers, and even improves the experience of non-participating customers by reducing their wait times.', 'The benefit of moving the payment to the customer‚Äôs mobile from a data perspective is that we can now confirm purchasing patterns and preferences from the customer easily and we can better profile customers at any participating coffee shop. We are starting to see the flow from discovery, through the purchase, with nothing more than a simple mobile application. Yet in this market the solution is still is missing significant customer data.', 'When I visit Japan I sometimes visit restaurants where orders are taken by a simple vending machine. A receipt is printed, and when the chef finishes making my order I present my receipt (which is sometimes just an order or queue number). They then hand me a tray of food. It‚Äôs a strange form of convenience, but it works quite well.', '\nJapanese restaurant order vending machine', 'Much of the modern retail experience now happens from the comfort of our homes. For example, music, clothing, and furniture is often purchased via Web stores rather than brick-and-mortar retail. Coffee is\u200a‚Äî\u200aperhaps surprisingly for some\u200a‚Äî\u200ano different.', 'Solutions that combine the digital shopping experience with the physical is known as ‚Äúborderless retail‚Äù as it allows the retail flow to continue beyond the walls of brick-and-mortar stores or ecommerce web apps.', 'To be honest, I coined ‚Äúborderless retail‚Äù in 2012 when designing retail services for automotive and clothing brands, but I‚Äôm going to keep pushing it until it catches on.', 'If we continue to focus our service augmentation on a specific specialty coffee-drinking demographic then we can omit the consumers who purchase instant or supermarket coffee at this stage. Our target is those consumers buying coffee beans from caf√©s and roasteries. How does our service, in this respect, work end-to-end?', 'If our consumer is using our app we have access to a lot of information which we can use to provide a more holistic experience. If we apply augmented reality (AR) into our app, we can enable the consumer to scan retail bags of coffee with their camera (pulling off branding logos and text for identifying the product\u200a‚Äî\u200awe don‚Äôt need QR codes where we‚Äôre going) for purchasing, or simply for gathering more information on that coffee. Even the information gathering feature is useful as we can start building an understanding of what coffee the consumer is interested in because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôll typically be asking about. If they ask their local barista about a coffee where does that feedback go?', 'We can now build a dynamic brewing guide app that can help consumers make great tasting coffee at home. Like other food items home brewing of speciality coffee is done with recipes which differ between products (as well as by other environmental factors). Those recipes include preparation guides and steps, including timing and quantities (such as coffee and water by grams). Interestingly flavors of coffee can differ widely based on different recipes, and many roasteries provide recipes for their products in physical card form.', '\nCounter Culture Coffee‚Äôs Taster‚Äôs Flavor Wheel from 2013', 'Yes, we researched this subject heavily before designing this service.', 'We can start the home experience whilst still in the caf√© when buying the bag of coffee. If the consumer scans a bag we can present the possible flavor profile and a snapshot of how the recipe looks across various brewing methods. It‚Äôs engaging and informational. It encourages more use of the app and supports the product owners who wish to sell good quality coffee to home brewers that are willing to spend money to build on their home experience.', 'At home we can start taking note of when the brewing guide app is loaded and how it‚Äôs used. This enables us to learn what coffee is being brewed at home, how often, and what flavors the consumer is interested in. It also provides us with other key information like their daily habits. That‚Äôs right, we‚Äôre likely to know what their common morning coffee schedule is: do they go to a coffee shop at 8.30, or do they brew at home at 7.15?', 'Once we have this, we can start using that to shape the consumer experience. If there‚Äôs a new product a caf√© wishes to offer we can look at the nearby consumers who are most likely to want the product based on our profiling, and we can push a notification to them. If they activate (read) the notification and then visit the retail outlet we can automatically activate the app for the retail experience to begin. If they then make that specific purchase we know we successfully converted a sale and can use that to measure our success metrics.', 'We can even calculate how much coffee is being consumed, or when it‚Äôs likely to expire, and push the consumer to buy more coffee before they run out, even directing them to web stores or retail outlets, depending on their profile.', 'There‚Äôs other environmental information we can take into account for these consumers: what was the weather like the day they chose to stay home and brew instead of visiting their local coffee shop? Is their home quite far from their favorite coffee shop? If so, what was the efficiency of the traffic and public transport the day they skipped their morning coffee? These all impact our daily habits and so it‚Äôs relevant we should use them to understand our target consumers.', '\nWould she still be sat ordering an iced coffee on a rainy day?', 'This data is exceptionally useful (and often publicly available) when personalizing the borderless retail experience, but it‚Äôs even more useful when we start to aggregate it (anonymously) and produce predictive models using machine learning for retailers to better understand their consumers.', 'For example, do consumers increase at lunchtime on weekdays when it‚Äôs lightly raining in the summer? When there‚Äôs an event located within half a kilometre does footfall increase or decrease at the store?', 'How can we take this well-oiled experience and push it further? What if we enable consumers to place their orders in advance and simply recognize them when they arrive at the caf√©? Imagine a busy train station, we‚Äôre running late for our train, we place the order 15-minutes away from the station, and our app notifies the station‚Äôs local caf√©.', 'When we arrive the caf√© recognizes our face, and ensures our order is waiting to pick-up and takeaway instantly, enabling us to make our train on-time and with a good cup of coffee. If this is our daily habit, how valuable is this for us?', 'We remove all need to use the app within the caf√© as we placed our order in advance. Our location can be sent to the caf√© so it can calculate the time needed to make our order, based on the current order queue, and ensure it‚Äôs ready, and hot, on arrival. We can then ask for feedback on how good the coffee was later that day with a subtle push to the consumer, to gather even more useful information to better improve that experience.', 'We built this process with direct communication with automatic coffee machines that could adjust pressure and temperature based on different data points from both the coffee and our consumer. Each and every coffee would be tailored, without a single human involved in the service.', 'Do we remove the point-of-sale now we have our nifty app? No. We still have to service many consumers who won‚Äôt use the app, or who potentially deal in cash. But the experience can be improved for everyone by simply reducing queues, and enabling products to be sold and consumed much more easily for those customers wishing to get more impact for their money. In the future our app could be quite normalized, replacing physical point-of-sales, but we‚Äôre not there yet.', '', 'Delivering these apps for a handful of coffee shops provides value, but not as much as delivering them for thousands of coffee shops. Increasing that install base is not easy, and we need the coffee shops to be onboard too. The less data we gather, the less likely coffee shops will be interested in what we have.', 'We can tackle this by providing an open Application Programming Interface (API) to enable third-party developers to make apps, services, and integrations on top of what we have already built.', 'This reduces our cost of development, increases our capability to gather data, and provides us with a potential new revenue stream. Owning the app experience isn‚Äôt necessary to gathering the data at every step of the retail experience and we really care about data.', 'The ethics of handling consumer data is important, and in this case study we can remove identifiable information before pushing it to our services, so that the mobile apps retain the personalisation capability, and the services aggregate anonymous data at scale, deleting any and all data once it‚Äôs no longer useful. The consumer experience is improved due to the data they provide so, as long as we respect individual privacy, we see this as a symbiotic relationship.', '', 'How deep can we go with our data, and how relevant is it for the customer experience? Sustainability, traceability, and cultural impact is very relevant to the modern consumer and our coffee shop experience should include these factors to make impact and experience of equal weight.', 'In this respect we should be gathering as much data from the coffee farms as possible, including seasonal crop information, (in coffee it‚Äôs relevant to gather data on altitude, region, and variety\u200a‚Äî\u200athere are over 60 varieties of coffee beans, all with different properties and market value. Thankfully roasters already gather much of this data).', 'This information can accompany the coffee beans when the consumer requests more data, whether that‚Äôs from the AR experience through the mobile device, whilst brewing, or even when they‚Äôre ordering their espresso to go. This is a bidirectional relationship: we get to understand what the consumer is interested in based on their interactions with that data.', 'From a depth perspective, we get to also understand the relationship with seasonal farming of the raw product to how well it‚Äôs received by the consumer. For example, the coffee retail culture in Melbourne, Australia will show they‚Äôre quite keen to drink the Geisha variety coffee grown in Columbia in late 2018, and lightly roasted in late March 2019 (fact), where-as consumers in Turku, Finland have a higher demand for Kenyan coffee, medium roasted, in late February.', 'We can compare interest with consumption, and home brewing to professional brewing, across seasons, mapping patterns to produce analytics that can enable a deeper understanding of consumer flow.', 'At scale this enables us to provide data that can reduce risk for all parties along the chain, and this inherently increases profits for everyone involved as margins can be more carefully adjusted, waste is reduced, and consumer turn over is higher. In regards to impact, this creates a more sustainable future for coffee farmers, and eventually enhances the ecology of the industry through waste reduction and best practices.', 'This project was a real case study started in 2011 and has spanned several years of iterative and careful development. It‚Äôs not the first that works to improve consumer experiences by connecting many different data points, but it‚Äôs one of the most complex. It spans independent coffee shops from fully attended coffee houses in popular urban areas in Europe, to fully automated train station coffee vendors in Japan.', 'Automotive companies, like Toyota, have been experimenting on combining habitual and social data to develop better urban experiences for road users for some time, with the architecture of our city planning expected to change to facilitate smaller, more personalised self-driving vehicles that align with our mobile consumer on-demand experience.', 'Retail is one of the most interesting areas for touching on the holistic experience when it comes to data gathering and it still has a long way to go to be fully realised, but seeing the whole picture, being thorough in data integrations, and thinking at a macro and micro level (from brand to consumer) is key to making any experience work from a revenue and personal perspective.', 'Combining data with expertly crafted and restrained deep learning systems enables phenomenal results when it comes to predicting patterns which, in-turn, enables us to provide a much more refined customer experience, adding value to our end-users who consume our app.', '']",[]

Since spring of 2017, my chief obsession has been the study of music theory and composition, driven by the desire to learn how the masters of old created the music I love. And one type of composition attracted me more than any of the others ‚Äì the fugue.', ""The word texture comes from a Latin root related to 'weaving', and it probably draws to your mind the tactile qualities of physical materials, like fabrics, papers or woods. Similarly, in music, it is used to describe how the melodies we hear in it appear to us. (As with so much in music, this is subjective, but not so subjective that we cannot make generalisations.) ‚Äì When listening, do we hear only a single melody? Or do we hear one melody at the surface, as it were, and several other melodies moving under the surface (but in harmony with that first melody)? Or do we hear several melodies none of which is more prominent than any of the others?"", 'What we have just described are the three categories of musical texture:', 'monophony (from mono-‚Äòone‚Äô + Greek phonƒì ‚Äòsound‚Äô), wherein we hear only a single melodic line.', '  Listen to this Kyrieleison by Hildegard von Bingen (1098‚Äî1179) and notice how, even after the second voice enters at the :15 mark, we still only perceive a single melodic line (because the two voices sing the same notes2).

In counterpoint, the different parts form harmonies together, but have different contour and rhythm. For instance, one part may rise while another descends, or one part may consist of crotchets and another of semibreves (in English, that means one part is played or sung ‚Äútwice as fast‚Äù as the other), and so on. John Rahn puts it more strikingly:', 'It is hard to write a beautiful song. It is harder to write several individually beautiful songs that, when sung simultaneously, sound as a more beautiful polyphonic whole. ‚Ä¶ The way that is accomplished in detail is ... ‚Äòcounterpoint‚Äô. (John Rahn, Music Inside Out: Going Too Far in Musical Essays, Taylor & Francis, 2001)', 'A fugue is a special kind of complex contrapuntal composition, wherein two or more subjects (distinct and recognisable melodies or themes, usually quite short) are introduced in imitation in each part, and then reappear throughout the composition in a variety of combinations and variations. The word fugue comes from Latin fuga (flight), and is related to fugere (flee) and fugare (chase), illustrating, maybe, how the subjects weave in and out of the song, now played higher, now lower, now in the foreground, now in the background.', 'Let‚Äôs listen to one. Take, for instance, this splendid Ricercar √° 6', 'from Johann Sebastian Bach‚Äôs Musikalisches Opfer, dedicated to Frederick the Great3, and try to pay attention to how the subject (the very first notes that you hear) is used to introduce each instrument in turn, and then how it reappears throughout the piece, sometimes in a new costume, but always recognisable.', 'The great attraction of the fugue, for me at least, is that it is not just a type of composition, but also a method for composing. Having written a subject, you use the rules of contrapuntal composition to write a countersubject that can be played alongside it, and then your composition will consist simply of combining these two subjects in different ways, more or less following a common scheme.4 So, in a sense, you write a subject, and then everything else follows. Or, as 16th-century composer and music theorist Nicola Vicentino put it, you ‚Äúwill always have material with which to compose without having to stop and reflect‚Äù.', 'Because of its strictness and complexity, the fugue is often seen as a profound and cerebral style of music, as Bach too was a profound and cerebral composer. Apart from the purely musical complexities of his music, he would often integrate puzzles, ciphers and oblique references to extramusical topics (usually devotional) into his music.', 'For instance, if you look at his scores, you will every now and then come across the following four-note sequence.', '', 'The notes are, in the German system, B, A, C and H, in other words spelling out the name BACH. This, the B-A-C-H motif, is the most famous of many musical cryptograms.', 'For the second edition of the Chilicorn Records compilation, I wanted to try my hand at writing a fugue. Specifically, I composed a fugue in three voices on the theme F-C-E, for Futurice (Bach was lucky that his name could be written completely with musical notes), as spelled out by the first three notes of the subject.', '', 'I wrote the fugue, but of course I don‚Äôt know how to play any instrument. So as any reasonable person might be expected to do, I decided to try my hand at writing a neural network that would perform it for me.', ""The software I used to compose the fugue, MuseScore, allows you to export a piece to MIDI. The MIDI format describes music as a collection of 'note on' and 'note off' events (corresponding to pressing and releasing a key on a piano) distributed through time."", 'The problem with this is that all notes are played with equal emphasis, i.e. equally loudly, and with ‚Äúperfect‚Äù timing ‚Äì in other words, it lacks all of those qualities that distinguish different human interpretations of a composition. All the right notes are there, but they don‚Äôt sound right; they have loudness but no dynamics.

After all, the same notes are being sounded in the same order.', 'There is an art-critical answer to that question, which I will ignore, and a technical answer, which can be boiled down to two aspects:', 'Of those, the second seemed to me the lower-hanging fruit. And besides, I had found a master‚Äôs thesis (by Iman Malik of the University of Bristol, who also wrote a very illuminating blog post about it) describing a machine learning solution for exactly that problem. (Most of what follows in this section is based on her method, and some of it is also based on her code.)', '', 'You might think that this image shows an ordinary piano, but you‚Äôd be mistaken. It actually shows a Yamaha Disklavier e-piano, which is able to record performances and save them to be played back later. It‚Äôs used in the annual e-Piano Junior Competition for young pianists, and many of the performances from the final rounds are later uploaded as MIDI files on the competition‚Äôs website, happily providing an excellent data set for us to use.', 'I let each song consist of an arbitrary number of moments in time, starting at 0 and proceeding towards infinity. At each moment, any of the 88 keys on the piano (from the lowest A to the highest C) may be either played or not played. Actually, we‚Äôll be a little bit more specific here and say that it can either be pressed down, held down (sustained) since before or not played at all. If we represent those 3 states with 2 integers ‚Äì {(1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 0)} ‚Äì, that gives us 88 time 2 equals 176 input features at each time step.', '', 'For the output, we have the same number of moments in time as for the input ‚Äì the length of the song does not change. We also have the same number of keys on the piano, and for each key at each point in time we want a velocity (meaning ‚Äúloudness‚Äù, or the speed with which a piano key goes from resting position to being fully depressed), ranging from 0 (silent) to 1 (fortississimo). That gives us 88 output features at each time step.', '', 'The keen reader will have noticed that I lied just then. I wrote that there were 176 features, but the image of the inputs shows a number of additional rows (features) at the top of the graph. That‚Äôs because, in addition to the 176 features representing the notes being played, I added a number of additional features based on my (limited, I admit) understanding of music theory.', ""By feature engineering, we try to use our domain knowledge (in this case, of music and music theory) to give the neural networks additional hints when predicting the velocities. (For an in-depth article on feature engineering, see Will Koehrsen's Feature Engineering: What Powers Machine Learning.) Here are some of the ones I used:"", 'Looking again at the visual representation of the features', '', 'you may see that the values at the top represent these engineered features, derived from the 88 notes being played or not.', 'The final model, implemented in Keras, is very similar to that proposed in the aforementioned paper.', '', 'I use recurrent layers (long short-term memory layers, to be precise) because how loud a note should be sounded will surely depend on which notes came before it. I make those recurrent layers bidirectional because, following the same logic, the loudness of a note will surely also depend on which other notes come after it.', 'Here it is in code:', 'So I had my data and my model. I trained it for some 130 epochs', '', ""and got a fine loss, although it should be noted that the baseline loss will be low, too, because the output matrix is so sparse. (One 'epoch' entails training the model with each sample in the data set exactly once.) I should note that the loss function being used here is mean squared error."", 'I used this model to make predictions for the fugue, recorded it with velocity-sensitive synthesisers and sent the track off to be included in the compilation, which it was.', 'Time passed. About half a year later, we had a data science training in the Futurice Berlin office, which inspired me to see if I could use my newfound knowledge to improve my implementation, which I had gone on using regularly during the previous months.', 'My main idea began with the following observation. If you transpose a song chromatically (or, in plain English, if you play all the notes of that song a certain number of keys further to the left or to the right on the piano), the dynamics (relative loudnesses) of the song should very nearly stay the same. But if you do such a transposition, the input into the first layer will look completely different from what it was before the transposition.', 'As an example, listen to the openings of these three versions of On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring by Frederick Delius. The first is the original', '', 'the second example is transposed down by a major second ‚Äì', '', 'and the third example is transposed up by a major second:', '', 'They sound very much alike, don‚Äôt they? And that‚Äôs in spite of the fact that the actual notes being played are very different. In other words, we have two very different inputs which should give very nearly the same output. And that‚Äôs a ripe opportunity for data augmentation. So I took each of the tracks in the data set and created from it twelve variations, the original plus eleven different transpositions, and thus at a stroke grew my data set by a factor of twelve.', 'But there was a fly in my sweet-scented ointment. As I implemented this, I came across something hideous, something grotesque even. I came across what may have been the worst bug that I ever wrote.', '', 'Yes ‚Äì for half a year I had only ever trained my neural network on a single batch of four songs, entirely ignoring the rest of my data set. During those six months, I presented my work to my colleagues, told friends about it and used it in my music ‚Ä¶ It was a somewhat embarrassing discovery, one feels urged to admit. But now, I just find it sort of miraculous that the neural network was able to produce passable results in the first place.', 'Having fixed the bug and trained the new model, with data augmentation, for 50 epochs, I realised that the best it could do was to predict a sort of average velocity (reminder: the velocity is the force with which a piano key is depressed) for all notes ‚Äì no crescendi or diminuendi here. (In a way, the model trained on a single batch produced more interesting results, as, being trained solely on a very specific subset of the data, it was more wild and opinionated than this second model, which regressed to a sort of bland mean.)', '', 'In other words, after half a year and countless hours spent implementing my model, I had to face up to the facts, which was that the model was no better at predicting velocities than simply assigning a constant value to every note. And using a complex neural network to do that, one would have to consider to be a case of over-engineering.', 'Per aspera ad astra! While my original idea and implementation ended in catastrophic failure, I had the feeling that, in the end, it would serve only to sweeten my ultimate and well-deserved success. Rethinking the problem, and figuring that simpler is better, I decided to model it as a tabular problem.', 'Seen in this way, every note event is a single row in a large table. Each note event has an associated time (specifically, the time passed since the beginning of the song) and pitch feature ‚Äì that‚Äôs the basic data gleaned from the raw MIDI file, and they make up the first two feature columns in the table.', 'In addition to that pair, I engineered a large number of additional features, some of which the reader may recognise from the previous iteration. They include the average pitch value of all currently pressed keys, the nearness to the end and to the midpoint of the song, meta information describing the song itself (e.g. duration, total number of notes sounded and so on) plus various values describing how the note event is related to notes appearing simultaneously with, before and after it. I also calculated running means, sums, standard deviations and so on for many of these features.', 'Golly! the reader may exclaim. That makes for a darned lot of features! Surely your model will overfit! As it turns out, no ‚Äì using weight decay we give the model an incentive to have weights closer to zero, meaning that, in the end, if all goes well, it will end up using only a limited subset of all these features.', 'Every personal software project is an occasion to learn a thing. At this time I‚Äôd just heard about the fastai library, which promised ease of use and excellent performance (as it turned out, both of those promises were founded in reality ‚Äì my only complaint would be that it‚Äôs so far poorly documented). Here‚Äôs how my model looked ‚Äì basically a neural network with two hidden layers:', 'The final training set consists of 1.77 million notes and the validation set of 0.22 million notes. The table has 213 columns, of which 1 is the output label ‚Äì the velocity.', 'Here‚Äôs how the model is created in code:', 'The loss function here is the exponential root mean squared error, although I suspect any variant of mean squared error would do the job. As you can imagine, fastai does quite a lot for us!', 'Having set it up as a tabular problem, it was easy to dig inside the data. Here is the feature that was most obviously related to the velocity (loudness), namely the octave (or, in English, how far to the left or right on the keyboard a note appears, where 0 is on leftmost side and 10 on the very right).', '', 'There was another, minor relation in the follows_pause feature, which is 1 if no other note was pressed when the note event in question occurred, and 0 otherwise.', '', 'Or, if numbers speak to you and boxes don‚Äôt, here are the highest and lowest Pearson correlation coefficients:', ""The best correlation here is the rolling average time passed since the last pressed note event ‚Äì the more time has passed since the previous note event, the quieter the following note will be played. We also see: 1) that the longer the surrounding notes are sustained (held pressed), the lower the velocity of the note event, and 2) that the higher the note event's pitch in comparison to the surrounding notes, the higher the velocity (an 'interval' is a difference in pitch between two notes)."", 'In general, there are two trends here:', 'Training the model for 4 epochs gave a training loss of 0.0498 and a validation loss of 0.0547 (both mean squared error). After that, the model began to overfit (the validation loss increased). This seems a lot higher than for the previous implementation, but remember that we are measuring different things ‚Äì there the sparse output matrix made for low losses, but here we are making velocity predictions only for note events, and not for silent parts.', 'The following diagrams are a visual representation of the model‚Äôs performance when run on a selection of samples from the validation set. Each graph is a song, and each dot is a note being played. On the y-axis we have the velocity predicted by the model, and on the x-axis the actual velocity played by the human pianist. A perfect model, in other words, would produce a straight diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right.', '', 'As you can see in these examples, the model does better than a baseline ‚Äì there is a noticeable positive correlation between the predicted velocities and the actual velocities.', '', 'For some songs, the relationship seems stronger, whereas for others there doesn‚Äôt seem to be much of one at all.', '', 'As one colleague pointed out when I gave a talk about this at our office, the dots appear rather expanded horizontally and rather compressed vertically. That is to say, the model is reserved, playing it safe by not predicting many extreme values, whereas the human performances have a much higher dynamic range.', 'But in propria causa nemo debet esse iudex ‚Äì that‚Äôs no one should be their own esteemed and honourable justice for us non-Latin-speakers.

However, on an infinite timescale one‚Äôs hype may become another one‚Äôs reality.', 'What is your role in the context of future mobility today and in the future?', 'At heycar, we focus on car access and ownership. With all the trends towards future ownership models still over 90% of all new and used cars are bought ‚Äúthe traditional way‚Äù. We‚Äôre looking to make that process easier to navigate. That said, heycar is extremely well positioned, by having automotive captive banks as partners, to look into, experiment with and promote new ownership models that ultimately benefit people who need mobility.', 'Are we too German centric when we look at the mobility world?', 'We spend a considerable part of our time talking to German consumers and understanding how their priorities are changing. That said, heycar‚Äôs management team has considerable overseas experience and we spend a lot of time tracking mobility topics outside of Germany in order to come up with appropriate new mobility adoption models for German consumers. There‚Äôs a lot we can learn from similar projects in the US, in Korea, and also in countries like Pakistan.', 'What do you think are the biggest challenges that we‚Äôre facing in Germany and on a global level?', 'The most urgent challenge we need is a full-frontal switch in vehicle ownership to sustainable mobility ‚Äì to get people out of their existing contexts and into options that are more carbon neutral. There is the hard work to be done on educating the population on why this is critical and what benefits they‚Äôll see. There is the hard work to ensure that sustainable mobility options are available, that the infrastructure to maintain them is also available and that any transition is financed so that it benefits the end user and the environment.', 'Who would be your ideal partners for a future mobility ecosystem?', 'As heycar expands, we are looking for partners who can assist us in making the customer journey around mobility easier to navigate. This means that we value partnerships with the companies that can provide vehicles, financing and insurance for those vehicles, and other additional products and services.', 'Why is it so hard for automotive companies to change and transform?', 'It is necessary for existing players to already have well-established and optimized processes as well as strong supplier and distributor networks in place. The more established a company, the harder to challenge the status quo, to literally put your revenue channels at risk. Automotive companies know what needs to be done, but don‚Äôt have this self-disruption DNA built in. They need to look outwards and we see in Berlin an explosion of automotive company funded initiatives. The main challenge will be for automotive companies to support these initiatives without strangling them in political or organisational overhead.', 'Does it make sense to become a software company when you are an OEM?', 'Absolutely. Look at the parallels with the mainframe and personal computer manufacturer, IBM. In changing markets, manufacturers fight for differentiation and ultimately IBM shed its manufacturing business to focus purely on digital services and solutions. Also look at consumer tech giant, Apple, where the services around personal and mobile computing continue to grow in importance as hardware sales reach global optimums.', 'How do you imagine the mobility market of the future - will sharing options outumber ownership?', 'I would love a world where sharing grows in importance and relevance. I see two issues. The first is, like with the telecommunications industry, it‚Äôs a question of last mile. Even though I live in Berlin, I still live outside of the catchment area of sharing options. It will take time for all urban residents to be able to reliably share mobility. What I would like to see is small projects in smaller towns to start introducing this outside of the main metropolitan areas. The second issue is, like with electricity generation, one of peak demand. How do you supply mobility elastically, to be there for everyone when they need it ‚Äì in order to drop the kids to school or get to work ‚Äì and what do you do with the inventory in the down time. While we‚Äôre solving these issues and exploring new solutions such as subscription, old school access to mobility (through ownership or leasing) will continue to dominate.', 'How will the future of mobility change us as inhabitants of the cities of the future?', 'We already see some of the benefits from access to mobility as a service where it‚Äôs easy for people to jump in when they need it. As more mobility moves towards service, perhaps one of the most exciting things we can benefit from will be less standing inventory and more ‚Äúgreen parkway‚Äù ‚Äì turning dedicated car parking spaces into public spaces. Imagine a city that starts to reclaim that space: where every street gets another 4 meters of walkway, where caf√©‚Äôs can spill out, where parking spots become playgrounds for children or enlarged bicycle lanes.', 'How much can we personalize mobility concepts and still maintain public service in our built environments?', 'I live in a paragon of a city with regard to public service ‚Äì we have bicycle greenways, trams, busses, underground trains, overground trains and regional trains. But even here there are use cases where we just need personalized mobility. I can‚Äôt get all the kids to their respective schools and get to work in the morning without some form of personalized transport. As personalized mobility becomes more mobility-as-a-service, it corresponds that public service also needs to trend more personal. There is a role for cooperation or competition between mobility providers and public service providers. As long as we don‚Äôt lose sight of the goal ‚Äì attending to the needs of our customers / citizens this space will continue to be interesting for generations to come.', 'Mobility related companies might more and more need to become software companies.

What has long been a common way of thinking and doing in software development is now increasingly being used to make business decisions. In a changing environment, agility is a requisite for success on all levels of an organisation. ', 'I recently spoke at ScanAgile. My talk dealt with what the requirements for implementing agile at all levels of an organisation are.', 'For agile to work throughout an organisation, it has to have the support of the whole organisation. The right kinds of transparency and visibility are a must: from top management to where the concrete work really happens, from one business unit to another. All company policies and guidelines also need to support working in an agile way. This requires alignment from the organisation‚Äôs specialised functions, such as Sourcing or HR.', 'To transform themselves, some organisations use ready-made models, while others create their own. Either way, the change can be hard and it will take its own time.', 'Everything starts with a change in mindset', 'For any new model to work in an organisation, the most important thing that has to change is the mindset. In and of themselves, new tools and ways of working are just another way of doing the same thing an organisation has always done - unless accompanied by a new mindset.', 'A mindset is built through daily activity. A new mindset is then built by challenging your thinking and the way you do your daily work. Agile gives us tools to work on both the mindset and practice.', 'People sometimes tend to see agile as something for ‚Äújust‚Äù software development or IT department to use. This is a misconception. Agile works on all levels of an organisation and it provides us with many tools that work in contexts other than development teams.', 'The retrospective is a great example. It‚Äôs a brilliant way of building a new mindset and works in any context. It helps teams and individuals to learn from what was done and closes the continuous improvement loop that lies at the heart of the agile mindset.', 'To make it work, there are few things to keep in mind:', 'We should always remember to look back to learn and build a better future.']","['Framing the context is important, especially if you are starting this practice. What have you achieved? What do you want to learn from it? Where do you want to go next? What is your timeframe?', 'If people are not familiar with retrospectives, prepare the invitation well. Help people understand the value it brings, so that they can prioritise their other responsibilities accordingly. Be very clear about what‚Äôs expected from the participants: presence? No emails at the same time? Any preparations or just arrive with an open mindset?', 'Help people build a psychologically safe environment in the team. Make sure people are genuinely able to bring their views and ideas to the table and don‚Äôt feel the need to hide behind roles or political play. Frame the topic and timeframe clearly, and be prepared to adjust it if the team feels it necessary.', 'Create good, concrete action points and clear responsibilities. This will help make the value of the retrospective as concrete as possible. Good communication on how the follow-up is going to happen is essential to spur action on this front.', 'Even one retrospective can bring a lot of value, but regularity really brings out its full potential. That way you will in a concrete way see the value of continuous improvement and build your mindset along the way.\n\nI believe the future is agile. To change our mindset and find success in this agile future, the retrospective is an excellent first step. It‚Äôs not rocket science - more like common sense, if you think about it.']"

Have you ever wondered how this time affects us? The effect is clearly visible, and yet it is only the beginning, as more and more technology is being embedded in our everyday lives. Too often, technology is created with the goal of making things more efficient from a technical or commercial point of view, simultaneously ignoring our well-being.', 'The amount of technology we use each day has been growing fast, and nowadays technology is present in all aspects of our lives. Ubiquitous computing was the first term to describe this concept of having computing power embedded everywhere around us, but the same concept has later been described with dozens of different terms, each having its own flavor, such as Pervasive Computing or Internet of Things.', 'Ever-present technology, like mobile phones, allows us to connect with others and build relationships, but extensive use of mobile phones and social media can also have negative effects on mental and physical health. Not only academics, but also other influencers in the tech scene, such as the Center for Humane Technology, have been trying to raise awareness of how technology steals our attention. Further, many tech giants in Silicon Valley, including Facebook and Apple, have recently started to address the issues of ubiquitous technology and social media by rolling out features that allow users to control the time they spend in their apps.', 'Business models resting on drawing the attention of users have dominated web-based companies since the beginning of Internet. With the rise of ubiquitous computing the effects of these business models have blended in our everyday lives resulting in different services fighting for our attention wherever we go.', 'Although one would assume that  technology is created to make our lives easier, and thus us happier, the average life satisfaction has remained more or less at the same level over the last 50 years. So, technology isn‚Äôt making us happier. At least not directly, and why is that?', 'Insufficient knowledge or negligence of the effects of ubiquitous computing, like its ever-presence or invisibility, is affecting the users negatively.', '', 'Ubiquitous computing is not inherently bad, in fact it opens doors to more intuitive and calm products and services. One of the reasons why ubiquitous computing has caused problems is the designers‚Äô insufficient understanding of the influence of the ever-present technology on human mind and behavior. For example, the use of graphical user interfaces may not always be the best solution, such as is discussed by Golden Krishna in his book ‚ÄúNo Interface is the Best Interface‚Äù.', 'To avoid creating ubiquitous products and services that cause problems, we need to follow a user-centered design process and test our products with real users in real contexts. It seems likely that insufficient knowledge of the effects of some traits of ubiquitous products and services, like their omnipresence or invisibility, is causing challenges. The deeper technology will be embedded into our lives, the more prominent these challenges will be.', 'We should understand the typical problems that ubiquitous computing may cause to users, and address them early in the design process.', 'If we could avoid the typical challenges with ubiquitous products and services, we could create better products with a lower investment, as fewer iterations would be needed during the design process. Therefore, I have created a set of design principles that help us avoid these problems and create ubiquitous products and services with a better user experience. Specifically, the design principles are focused on user interfaces. Following these principles will not only create a better user experience, but will also guide us towards a healthier relationship with technology. Considering the pace at which the new technologies are being embedded in our surroundings, it will be more and more important to follow these principles.', 'Here‚Äôs a quick review of the design principles for you to see what to consider when developing services with ubiquitous computing. A more detailed discussion of the design principles and some examples can be found here.', 'Create a Natural Feeling\nUsing a product that feels natural is effortless and graceful, which in the end results in happy users. In general, a system that (i) mirrors human capabilities, (ii) optimizes progress from novice to expert, (iii) can adjust itself to given contexts and tasks, and (iv) fulfils user needs, feels natural to the users.', 'Support Activities and Implicit Interaction\nIn order not to overload users, ubiquitous services and products need to be designed for the context of use to automatically support the natural behaviour of the users, and not only to execute individual tasks. This requires a deep understanding of the users, which can be acquired through research methods such as ethnographic studies and observations.', 'Metaphors and Mental Models\nProducts or services leveraging ubiquitous computing can suffer from invisibility, which is why suitable metaphors should be used to describe the product or service to the users and to create a correct mental model for the users. Think about Alexa and Siri, for example. The complicated technology needed to understand what you are saying is disguised behind a metaphor of a clever personal assistant.', 'Visibility and User Guidance\nTo feel natural, a product or service should have a user interface that gives proper feedback to the users and guides them with scaffolding. As ubiquitous computing applications embedded in the everyday surroundings may be hard for users to see and understand, discoverability of the product or service is important.', 'Calm Technology\nDue to the physical presence of the product or service, it is important that designers create calm products or services that do not unnecessarily draw the attention of the users, and remain otherwise in the periphery of the attention.', 'Designing with Data\nAs ubiquitous computing applications often rely on different kinds of sensors, they typically have access to vast amounts of data. It is, however, important to show only actionable and meaningful data to the users so that the product or service remains calm.', 'Physical Appearance\nIt‚Äôs important to consider the physical appearance of the product or service leveraging ubiquitous computing, as interactions will increasingly be focused on physical objects and environments.', 'Privacy and Ethics\nUbiquitous computing and embedded technology often means that the product or service has access to personal data. Generally, if users do not fathom, there is a privacy problem. Users should have control over the product or service to manage privacy related aspects, but it is also the designers‚Äô responsibility to take privacy into account, by for example deciding how user data is handled. Users should also be made aware of the presence of the products or services leveraging ubiquitous computing.', '', 'I hope this post will help you to acquire a quick overview on what is important when designing novel ubiquitous computing applications that feel as natural as possible. If you find a certain topic area especially interesting, there is a lot more to read about each of them. You can start by reading my more detailed article.']",[]

Highly isolated from the main business and mostly invisible to employees.', 'This is all fine if you see business and world impact as separate and separable things of a company‚Äôs operations. They are not, though. They are deeply interrelated. The only thing separable is the attention given to them: you can have a lot of people focus only on business and some people focus only on impact. That might just not be the best idea, either for business or for impact.', 'So how does a company take United Nations Sustainable Development Goals beyond the annual CSR report, into the core of their strategy and into the hands of each and every one of their employees?

But he‚Äôs not entirely sure about the impact part‚Äìit‚Äôs just a sport after all?\nHe takes the canvas and another team member. They do some thinking together. Hadrien comes to realise some hidden impacts of FIBA‚Äôs efforts: for example, 3x3 getting more serious makes it a bit more likely for teens in certain contexts to take up basketball as opposed to conflict, small crime or substance abuse. It creates positive role models. It promotes a healthy lifestyle. It creates healthy entertainment. It build community. Sure, there‚Äôs the gambling side of it, present in most serious sports. There‚Äôs an environmental footprint. What does it all mean to Hadrien and how can he use his role to increase the positive impact and decrease the negative? That‚Äôs up to him to decide.

Peace, justice and strong institutions‚Äù and wear them both with pride.', 'Why would a company want their employees to stick SDGs on their laptops? And why would employees do it?\nHere‚Äôs the thinking process that got us here.', 'This is obvious to us, but perhaps not obvious to everyone: A company‚Äôs impact on the world comes through all the services and all the products the company is putting into the world and every single action of every single employee of that company. Sure, the CSR department has a big role to play as the champion of societal impact, both in board discussions and in employee engagement. But to think they are the only, or even main responsible for the impact ... is just silly.', 'Everyone has a part to play.', 'This is, I think, common knowledge: focus on getting a raise and you‚Äôll eventually get a raise.

Employee satisfaction is slightly less reported on, but clearly in the core of any strategy we‚Äôve ever had and relatively easy to follow and understand.

https://futurice.com/blog/construction-digital-transformation,Digital Transformation in construction industry,26 Feb 2019,Emerging Tech,Putting its House in Order: Four Ways Construction can Pull Together to Embrace the Benefits of Digital Transformation,[],"['Few sectors look more ripe for disruption than construction and yet the barriers to successful digital transformation in construction industry remain high. While there are examples of cutting edge innovation, many of the established players remain risk-averse and sceptical about the investment case for adopting new technologies.', 'The integration of existing software and physical processes with new solutions is an acute worry, and something we‚Äôve seen in other industries ‚Äì in particular banking and, thinking further back, bricks and mortar retail. This concern is borne out by the figures ‚Äì Aecom‚Äôs recent ‚ÄòFuture of Infrastructure‚Äô report found that only 56% of industry professionals considered themselves good at adopting and scaling innovative delivery. \nHere are four key insights into how the construction industry can truly embrace the benefits of digital transformation:', 'Construction‚Äôs productivity gap must surely be a catalyst for change. McKinsey‚Äôs figures show that despite being one of the largest sectors in the world, global construction productivity growth averaged just 1% a year over the past 20 years compared to 3.6% for manufacturing. Meanwhile, in the UK, the combined effect of stalled construction/infrastructure projects in 2015-16 alone was estimated to have had a ¬£35 billion impact on investment related GDP.', 'When it comes to improving productivity, tech is key. Specifically, this means adopting consistent technology throughout a project. But what does this look like in practice? And how does this look across a multi-year build project? Sophisticated project management software offers cost savings, but integrating it engrained workplace culture can be problematic, which puts a premium on user-centred service design as part of a framework for delivery.', 'As more and more capable (and affordable) hardware comes into play Infrastructure firm Aecom is experimenting with using virtual and augmented reality solutions to offer interactive and easily accessible design models, allowing users to walk through the design of an asset in a virtual environment. This allows contractors to deliver highly accurate visualisations for consultations - such as the A303 around Stonehenge - which can lead to better decision making and improved outcomes for stakeholders. Elsewhere, there is a growing use of drones for data capture, laying cables and transporting materials on site ‚Äì Aecom claims to have more drones than the US military! Alongside IoT sensors and telematics equipment, the use of digital environments to pre-assemble panels is likely to become more mainstream while automation of functions such as welding will radically alter the supply chain and increase productivity.', 'Built Robotics look set to make an impact on the $130 billion global excavation industry. Started by an ex-Google engineer, the robotics company has developed a fleet of autonomous earth movers that allow operators to pre-programme precise coordinates for the size of the hole that needs to be dug. Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will start to predict risks in the supply chain ‚Äì it‚Äôs already possible to use AI to predict risk from photos. Emerging tech doesn‚Äôt just have the capability to reduce cost and boost productivity: it also has the potential to massively improve safety on site ‚Äì  the pioneering use of robots to assist with assembling scaffolding is a good example; manufacturers Kewazo claim the robots will help prevent accidents and long term musculoskeletal injuries caused by constant lifting. Robots are also expected to reduce onsite labour costs by 33% and reduce the time needed to assemble the scaffold by 42%. The use of some level of personal protective equipment is ubiquitous, if uneven, and there‚Äôs an opportunity to upgrade even the basics like boots and helmets with smart, connected sensors.', 'One year on from its high profile collapse, a key lesson the construction sector can take from Carillion is the need for a shift away from adversarial contracts which encourage self-interested negotiations and a race to the bottom on price. An adversarial approach can distort behaviour, creating an interest in exploiting problems that arise, rather than true collaboration with partners. More generally, the distrust implicit in many big, highly risk-averse contracts tends to foster micro-management rather than encourage innovation.', 'While there are no silver bullet solutions, the construction sector must take collective responsibility for changing the status quo. Contracts that highlight explicit achievement metrics that work for all parties is one way forward. For their part, clients have a key role to play in driving cultural and mindset changes around the formulation of contracts are drafted and implemented. There are big benefits to doing things differently. As a speaker at a recent FT Future of Construction summit put it: ‚ÄúGreater collaboration equals greater productivity equals greater profit.‚Äù', '', 'Supply chain visibility and information sharing are well-known problems within construction. Many clients will never get to see what happens within the project supply chain: delivering a sense of connection is possible with improved information sharing, and this can reinforce a sense of trust.', 'Futurice was founded in Finland, where trust and radical transparency are embedded within national work culture. It‚Äôs considered important and empowering for everyone in a company to know what is happening. Within construction, industry leaders need to drive the cultural changes that will underpin the collaboration, transparency and information sharing so key to the sector‚Äôs future.', 'As with the productivity gap, tech is construction‚Äôs friend in addressing this issue. Existing technology such as cloud collaboration and open data platforms can improve visibility, facilitate sharing and connecting data and generally help introduce a more integrated approach to big projects. What‚Äôs more, smarter use of open data platforms could help ensure relevant asset data is shared with key stakeholders, highlighting problems more quickly and reducing uncertainty.', 'Digital tools also have a role to play in bringing the right people together at the right time - such as ensuring specialist subcontractors are involved in design at an early stage to avoid designs that are unbuildable ‚Äì encouraging all parties to collaborate and share both in the risks and the rewards of a project.', 'While a huge mindset shift is required to facilitate improved information sharing and project transparency, the gain is worth the pain. If contractors can deliver a project with greater predictability around timing and cost outcomes, clients will be more willing to take risks and innovate. This, in turn, will help construction as a sector improve productivity and fulfil its growth potential.', 'Yes, there is a bewildering choice of tech solutions to choose from. However, our advice here at Futurice is: experiment, start small, avoid focusing too hard on the early numbers and open up to the construction tech ecosystem. Bring in innovation and data experts and allow them to hack your data and find problems worth solving.\nHere in the UK, there has never been a better time to experiment thanks to initiatives such as the Government‚Äôs new Construction Sector Deal, a legislative and funding package aimed at boosting productivity. The case for change is crystal clear ‚Äì we just need to pull together as a sector to make it happen.', ""If you'd like to talk with us about the future of construction, you can get me at David.Mitchell@Futurice.com""]","['Invest in Tech to Close the Productivity Gap', 'We need a new approach to contracts', 'Prioritise visibility, connectivity and information sharing', 'If we can fix the problems, the opportunities are huge.\nIf the construction sector can tackle the challenges to digital transformation, the opportunity is huge. McKinsey even put a figure on it ‚Äì globally they estimate there is a $1.6 trillion opportunity to close the gap. Meanwhile, Mace believes that if it fixed its productivity problem, the UK construction sector could be delivering an additional ¬£100 billion of growth to the economy.']"

In this instance that involves attaching a Raspberry Pi for recording data and running the deep learning model, a wide-angle lens camera for it to see the track, and a servo control board for driving the motors. Starting with the electronics, integrations began with removing the RC receiver, and wiring everything up to the car so that it could be steered using the Raspberry Pi. Next, it was time to tackle the mechanical hardware.', 'The building process itself normally takes long periods of measuring, estimating, designing the prototype then waiting hours for large 3D models to finish printing.  This is in addition to testing, iterating to avoid interference with moving parts, and breaking things by running into the wall at high speed. Take the camera mount, for example: there are very few straight surfaces on the car and some no-go zones that need to be kept clear for moving and hot mechanical parts. You also don‚Äôt know in advance some details like the optimal camera angle for the machine learning. This needs to be tested later on‚Ä¶ That would mean you have to take time to design a complicated fitting just to reprint everything again later on. In our case, even the idea of using the handyman‚Äôs secret weapon (duct tape), was discarded early on since it might get caught in the wheels or driveshaft.', 'We realized that we needed a prototyping technique with the following features:', 'Luckily for us though, one of our tech gurus (Paul) likes tough problems and has been working on a parametric approach to generating functional 3D models for practical maker use such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino enclosures. The benefit of this approach is that the models are compatible with self-locking blocks such as Mega Bloks¬Æ and Lego¬Æ. This solves compatibility, so next up: ease of use.', ' PELA Blocks come in many different sizes', 'The first challenge was to attach self-locking blocks to the frame of our car. This was our first chance to leverage the coolest feature of PELA Blocks: parametric generation. We printed 4x22 PELA blocks (which were not available in stores) and bolted them on. These make the most of the space available by being custom fitted to the sides of the car. With this we now have a solid base - a hardware platform, if you will - that supports all sorts of creative self-locking block based structures, and is easy to use for all skill levels.', ' One platform to build them all, one platform to bind them.', 'Third point: flexibility. With all the accelerating, swerving and (occasional) crashing going on, some parts need to take a lot of punishment. Here we found that using a Flexible PELA block made out of TPU works admirably. Since we have a large range of compatible parts, there is also flexibility in the process itself - features can be hacked on the fly from multiple smaller, generic parts for quick testing.

More complex building projects can be explained using anything from simple diagrams all the way up to step-by-step assembly guides.

This worked fine as long as we had plenty of space to drive around in. Unfortunately, while brick walls are easy to make, they are also quite easy to break.', '', 'Building a minimal frame by clipping together beams of various lengths took 2-3 times as long as the bricks because you have to plan and think a bit more.

https://futurice.com/blog/youre-fyred,You're Fyred!,15 Feb 2019,Culture,A rumination on the corporate culture behind Fyre Festival.,[],"['Back in 2017, Fyre Festival was an eruption of hubris, delusion and incompetence that created one of the biggest tsunamis of *schadenfreude* the Internet has ever seen. No mean feat that. At the time it seemed like no one in this flustercuck was deserving of our sympathy - just a bunch of snake oil salesmen and the kind of entitled fools who are soon parted from their money anyway. ', 'There are two documentaries out on this  mother of all pseudo-events - one by Netflix and the other by Hulu. I watched the Netflix one. In some ways, it paints a slightly more nuanced picture. In others it confirms the craven idiocy and greed that animated the whole project.', 'Most importantly, the documentary highlights that there were people deserving of sympathy and support: the locals at Grand Exuma, who sacrificed real time and resources to the project and were left empty-handed as the hypebeasts fled the Lord of Flies shitstorm they‚Äôd created. The people left behind were essentially invisible until now. After the documentaries premiered, the restaurant that was ripped off managed to more than recoup its losses through a GoFundMe campaign.', 'For those who have forgotten or were blissfully unaware of Fyre Festival to begin with, it was started as a way to launch Fyre Media‚Äôs service for booking artists. Their aim was to become the ‚ÄúUber of booking talent‚Äù. Yes, people were trying to be the ‚ÄúUber of‚Äù as recently as 2017. The festival was supposed to offer people the chance to enjoy music, luxury accommodations and pristine beaches in close proximity with supermodels and Instagram influencers. It was essentially an epic manifestation of FOMO that tried to become a reality.', 'Unsuccessfully. Spectacularly so.', 'From where I sit, one of the important things the documentary shed light on was how deeply it was essentially a failure of culture - both for us as a society living in a particular technological reality and for the company trying to produce the festival.', 'Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the latter.', 'Fyre Media was set up like an authoritarian 20th century ‚Äúindustrial‚Äù organisation that had weaponised 21st century corporate culture tropes about community and commitment to extract more out of people and obscure the reality of what they were doing.', 'A total lack of transparency allowed it to hide how bad things were right up until the very end.', 'There was no tolerance for dissent even when it was clearly based on expertise in the area in question. There was a tendency to kill the messenger. Bearers of bad news were criticised for having a bad attitude. In this context, the leadership managed to abuse the idea of a solution-focused culture by accusing internal critics of being problem-focused and using it so silence dissent. People unwilling to go along and join the collective delusion were let go, sooner or later.', 'All decision-making power was removed from the frontline where the actual work is done. Once again, if your knowhow came into conflict with the collective delusion the key protagonists operated under or, at the very least, felt necessary to maintain, you‚Äôd be let go.', 'Combining the worst aspects of old-school corporate management with new school digital marketing is obviously quite potent. In a bad way. In the case of Fyre Festival, their culture was so wrong, it veered into criminality. And just like cultural change needs to start at the top to be effective, the rot has to start there, too, to be this pervasive. William McFarland, the CEO of Fire Media, was sentenced to prison for defrauding investors of over 27 million dollars.', 'On a side note, all through watching the documentary, something that repeatedly came to mind was Theranos. There‚Äôs a documentary out on that company, too. Tapping into something people really want to believe is always powerful. It‚Äôs a shame when people misuse it.', 'PS. Of course documentaries are always problematic in that there‚Äôs really no such thing - just a carefully curated or moderated presentation of a particular perspective. Or, at times, a naked attempt to manipulate. The same applies in this case. Is the Netflix documentary on Fyre Festival just the postscript to the scam?']",[]

So get your crystal ball out, zip up your space suit and let‚Äôs get ready for time travel.', 'Not so fast. Exploring how a project might develop from a future lens can be challenging because speculation means we have no hard facts. So, when imagining future scenarios, we often fall into our creative echo-chambers, become hyper-fixated on certain trends, start to group-think and miss blind spots, blank under pressure, generate predictable storylines (we‚Äôve all nodded along to sci-fi tropes) or overthink the infinite possibilities and find ourselves in a futures black hole. Not to mention that human-centered design approaches encourage us to focus on the needs of the end-user (which are likely to be immediate needs) and it is not always intuitive for us to consider the consequences of what could follow.', 'So what can we do? Here at Futurice, speculative improvisation is a playful technique we like to use to co-build and explore future scenarios with our colleagues and teams.

For example, when we ran this exercise exploring the future of a fictitious preventative healthcare startup - which by 2030, had transformed into a marketplace of health data - principles such as inclusivity, privacy and control clearly emerged in importance.', 'Travelling into slices of imagined futures can help us to start flagging major pitfalls and opportunities that might unfold. Dramatised scenarios can help spark meaningful conversations with our teams, pushing us to consider the wider ethical implications of what we are doing and informing high-level, guiding principles for how we wish to design and build today.', 'Recently, speaking on the topic at the ‚ÄúHumane Tech‚Äù Meetup here in London, Luca Acito and I discussed the importance of taking the time at the beginning of projects in order to define guiding principles that can be mined from a future lens.', '', 'Drafting guiding principles that consider a longer timeline, can help us to reduce risk, align teams around a common vision and act as a north star in moments where we navigate through complexity and ambiguity. Guiding principles can also help us ‚Äúfuture-proof‚Äù product and service propositions, as teams consider what it will take to keep up with anticipated changes in needs, behaviours and norms - from both a user and market perspective.', 'What might these principles look like in practice? Here at Futurice, we have already released a few, including ‚ÄúDesign Principles for Children‚Äôs Voice Services‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Futurice Principles for Ethical AI‚Äù. Both are sets of high-level principles that teams can refer to when working with specific technologies.', 'So if you have 20 minutes to spare and an open attitude - give it a go!', 'And for some parting thoughts - you might be wondering why we‚Äôre calling it speculative improvisation.

As such, the industry is built around engineering and design: creating perfectly built cars, with a balance of parts working smoothly and precisely together, and a continuously refined driving experience.\n\nHowever, in today‚Äôs world, cars alone and the services built around them won‚Äôt be enough to sustain auto companies. ', 'The rise of carsharing and ridesharing services, along with new subscription models providing multiple forms of mobility, has meant that the mobility needs of consumers are becoming increasingly dynamic. Their expectations no longer revolve predominantly around the car.', 'If auto brands are to survive they will need to take a radical new service-driven approach and shift their focus from simply building cars, to designing an ecosystem of integrated mobility services. Rather than building them around the car driving experience, these ecosystems will need to revolve entirely around the needs of the user. Here are four steps to help carmakers make the transition.\nIt all starts with connectivity', 'The foundations of mobility ecosystems started to emerge with the investment in connectivity in order to make the experience around the car more seamless. These initiatives have provided a consistent flow of user mobility data that has given rise to new types of service offerings.', 'The risk for carmakers is to get established in the mobility services industry only as data producers and data providers. Being a raw data producer offers limited opportunities for the brand and for customer engagement. But becoming a service provider would offer the possibility to evolve the brand image, keep it visible and present in the mobility market.', 'Carmakers must invest in and build the necessary expertise to identify the multiple service opportunities within their existing data sets. If they fail to do this they risk losing relevance as third party companies continue to access the data and build mobility solutions of their own.', '', 'Many car manufacturers have already started to offer digital services that draw on data and try to cover many different use cases. Some examples are Mercedes me, Daimler‚Äôs Car2go and BMW‚Äôs group of Now services (DriveNow, ParkNow, ChargeNow). The problem is that most of these services either still revolve around the car itself or the solutions generally haven‚Äôt been interlinked. As a result, the experience for consumers is fragmented.', 'One service that is starting to create a more interlinked ecosystem though is Whim. With its subscription-based model, the company offers access to different mobility solutions that the user can choose based on their needs. Whim is essentially playing the role of an orchestrator of mobility offerings. With this, the car becomes just one element within a mobility ecosystem of connected products and services. It‚Äôs this model that traditional carmakers must start to emulate within their own businesses.', 'An ecosystem is, by definition, composed of various services and products that belong to disparate departments and business areas. To build this ecosystem, automotive companies need to be structured in a way that enables greater collaboration across departments. Decision makers need to be enabled through a more agile and independent process, instead of a hierarchical and vertical one that most carmakers currently operate.', 'Futurice has experience in guiding small and large organisations in the cultural transformation that facilitates this. We believe that automotive brands should start organising their businesses around a Lean Digital Agenda. This strategic initiative combines a company‚Äôs various assets ‚Äì its brand, knowledge and technologies, business insights, customer data, etc. ‚Äì into one unified picture, providing a clearer vision and a deeper analysis of a company‚Äôs current offering and the wider market. It covers all departments to set a common direction and a unified offer.', 'On top of this, the Lean Digital Agenda consists of an actionable strategy that considers the profile of the company, its history, its strengths and weaknesses to determine the next steps in achieving the vision. It also, crucially, determines how a brand‚Äôs raw data should be interpreted and which untapped business opportunities that emerge from the datasets should be pursued and how.', '', 'With this more holistic approach, companies are better able to identify the biggest opportunities, as well as the gaps in their service vision. Multiple new projects or lighthouse initiatives can then start to emerge and help carmakers to achieve the ultimate goal of building their integrated mobility ecosystem.', 'These initiatives could be in the form of startups or innovation hubs that are responsible for incubating and offering new mobility services for the market. Or it could be through co-leading initiatives, where the automotive brand and a company like Futurice jointly drive specific internal projects to help achieve the vision goals.', 'Throughout the process, data is pivotal. During the Lean Digital Agenda, it should be continuously analysed to validate and refine the vision, something which should never remain static. At the same time, data is the fundamental building blocks for developing services and verifying the success of the ecosystem. In this continuous loop of validation and creation, the mobility ecosystem can grow and the brand with it.', 'Cars are a perfectly engineered and balanced set of parts that make up the driving experience. In a similar way, mobility ecosystems should be a balanced and interconnected set of services and products that answer the new mobility needs. Putting the ecosystem at the heart of their offer will be critical for auto brands if they want to remain relevant and competitive in the era of services.', 'You would like to dig deeper and learn more about mobility ecosystems and the interplay of data and trust?

But what do these terms mean?', 'Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers dream of creating machines that can perform any intellectual task that human beings can. As soon as the first digital computers were built, people started to wonder if they could replicate human reasoning capabilities. Scholars have worked hard on this dream ever since.', ""No one has, however, yet managed to develop a human-level intelligence in a machine and, despite what you sometimes read on over-enthusiastic news articles, we are not even close to that. Human-level AI, or artificial general intelligence (AGI), remains a far-fetching research agenda. The research effort hasn't been completely fruitless, though. While the full AGI has turned out to be an elusive goal, researchers have produced many practical advances by focusing on subproblems of intelligence. This has delivered us functional speech and face recognition capabilities among other things. Most progress today is made on these kind of applied AI tasks that focus on one narrow problem at a time."", ""The definition of what is considered AI shifts over time. There is an old joke that as soon as somebody manages to implement an AI capability, people stop calling it AI. Thirty years ago an application that gives turn-by-turn navigation instructions to any address would most definitely have been considered AI. Now, it's just an app on your phone."", ""Some things that at first seem intelligent to a casual observer may not be AI. A famous example is the 1960's ELIZA chatbot posing as a psychotherapist. It used simple pattern matching rules for responding to user input. Despite its simplicity, it managed to convince many that there was more to it than there really was. As a more modern example, humanoid robots might seem life-like but may still be controlled by a simple script."", 'Often, AI is just marketing speak. Whenever you hear somebody hyping up how their app has AI, they very likely should actually be talking about machine learning.', '', 'Machine learning is a toolkit for implementing recommendations, predictions and other exciting application features. Machine learning is a collection of statistical methods for finding solutions to problems from data. The goal of machine learning is to get computers to do things by presenting them examples of what they should accomplish. This is different from the usual software development where human engineers have to figure out the solution by themselves. Machine learning is a good approach in cases that are too complicated (what is the winning strategy in chess?) or too big (how to make personalized book recommendations for every Amazon customer?) for humans to solve directly.', 'Machine learning is not an automatic problem solver, though. Humans are still needed in the loop. Machine learning can only solve tasks that are described in precise mathematical terms. Humans also have to collect representative training data and validate the results.', 'You can read more about use cases for machine learning from an earlier blog post by my colleague.', 'Deep learning is one particular family of machine learning methods. Deep learning is currently popular and responsible for many recent advances on image and speech recognition.', 'In traditional (that is, non-deep) machine learning, a human data scientist has to spend considerable effort on figuring out how the raw data should be represented so that a machine can learn efficiently. Deep learning is able to mostly overcome this costly step by automatically constructing suitable data representations. The ""deep"" in the name refers to the fact that the learned representations are hierarchical. This makes deep learning a good match for many complicated real world problems, because those often have a hierarchical structure (for example, speech is a thought expressed as words that consist of phonemes that consist of digitized sound samples).', 'Machine learning methods tend to perform the better the more data is available for learning. But there is an upper limit: at some point the performance saturates and stops improving with more data. Deep learning scales up much further than other types of machine learning. Therefore, deep learning is the method of choice when dealing with extremely big datasets. The price to pay is that the required computational power can be huge.', ""During the past, there has been numerous other propositions besides machine learning for confronting AI problems. Expert systems strive to encode human intelligence as inference rules and knowledge databases. They have been used, for example, in diagnosing system malfunctions. Some tasks can be solved by applying logic, search and raw computation. Deep Blue, the computer that beat human chess champions in 1990's, was essentially using a brute-force search through the game tree. There has been many attempts on building biologically-inspired architectures that aim to directly mimic how human brain works but none has yet took off."", 'These alternative approaches have enjoyed success only on limited application domains or have fallen out of favor because deep learning and other machine learning based approaches have turned out to be more effective.']",[]

We‚Äôve also seen that facial recognition, customer journeys, radical customer journey improvements with emerging technology and business process innovation are becoming extremely hot topics here - just as they are across the Nordics.

The invention of the car was a huge step forward for mobility, and so far cars have only become more popular. For many, nothing can match the flexibility, convenience and privacy of owning a car.\n', 'Today, those who want to avoid the hassle of owning a car can look for alternatives such as Uber, Lyft, taxi, public transport or shared car ownership. While these solutions lift some of the burdens mentioned before, they are still too expensive or inflexible to fully replace individual car ownership.', 'Fortunately, our mobility options will expand soon as we are on the verge of the next revolution in human transportation: autonomous cars will conquer streets and change our society in profound ways. Optimistic estimates state that we are less than 5 years away from fully autonomous vehicles, while more conservative estimates hover around 10 to 15 years.', 'The arrival of autonomous cars suddenly makes transportation services more affordable because the service providers can eliminate their biggest cost ‚Äì the human driver. Furthermore, several other benefits of autonomous cars, such as higher utilisation rate, longer lifespan and decreased maintenance needs help to push the costs even lower. Thanks to the cost savings, the next generation of mobility services will be more accessible than ever.', 'The low costs of next-generation ride-hailing attracts new customers, which allows service providers to operate bigger fleets of cars. Bigger fleets, in turn, make the mobility services more flexible, which again attracts a new wave of customers, creating a positive feedback loop. As the mobility services become more popular, they will provide flexibility never seen before: cars will pick us up in seconds instead of minutes.', 'The cost savings and the great user experience of the new mobility services create a very attractive alternative for car ownership. In fact, so attractive that car ownership starts to shrink, eventually disappearing almost completely. People will be delighted to not have to worry about maintenance, insurance, parking, drinking alcohol or obeying traffic regulations. What is even better, the driver‚Äôs time will be freed up for more productive activities.', 'People will first abandon their cars in big cities and the change will spread gradually to less populated areas, although, in the most rural places, new transportation services might not fully replace car ownership. Certainly there will be people who still want to own a car for the love of driving or for the sake of self-expression. But keeping a car will be a costly luxury like owning a horse today. What is possible, though, is that those who own an autonomous car can rent it for fleet operators to earn extra money while they don‚Äôt use the car themselves. Sharing a car for others can greatly reduce the cost of ownership.', 'In addition to making our lives easier, mobility services have the potential to improve our cities in several ways. The possible benefits come from the fact that shared cars have much higher utilisation than private cars, which are parked 95% of the time. Therefore, we need a lot fewer shared cars to move us around, freeing space for pedestrians, cyclists and green spaces. However, it‚Äôs not enough to just reduce the number of cars to make our cities better ‚Äì we also need to reduce traffic. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not clear if ride-hailing can accomplish this; in fact, [a report] by Shaller Consulting(http://www.schallerconsult.com/rideservices/automobility.pdf) shows that Uber and Lyft are currently doing exactly the opposite: a single ride with Uber or Lyft causes approximately 160% more traffic than the trip they replace.', 'One reason for the increased traffic is that the Uber and Lyft drivers travel without passengers to pick-up people from different locations and that most of the trips involve just one passenger. Another reason is that ride-hailing seems to lure public transport users and people who travel by foot or bike more than it convinces drivers to abandon their private cars. Replacing metros, buses and trains with small cars certainly doesn‚Äôt make transportation more effective or ecologically sustainable.', 'To keep traffic under control, cities have to improve their public transport system and make it more attractive. They can, for example, offer public transport for free (paid by tax money) and follow the example of London, Stockholm and Singapore in introducing peak-hour fees for private cars. Many cities also have room for improving the last-kilometre mobility with pedestrian and bicycle-friendly urban planning, and by providing options for lighter mobility, such as city bikes and electric scooters.', 'Although the effects of ride-hailing seem negative in the near future, we will likely see a healthy balance of mass transportation, ride-hailing, and lighter last-kilometre mobility in the long term after autonomous vehicles have fully replaced traditional cars. It‚Äôs clear that ride-hailing won‚Äôt be a replacement for public transport but rather an extension of it.', 'As new mobility services free us from the driving duties, the big question will be how we are going to spend the extra time while on board. Presumably, we would spend it the same way that we currently do on public transportation: we use our smartphones and laptops, listen to music, read books, chat with friends or even take naps. However, the beauty of the new ride-hailing services is that they offer much more privacy than sitting in a bus with 30 other passengers or riding a taxi with a human driver. The privacy allow us to enjoy new kind of options, for example, the new autonomous cars could have a hi-fi entertainment system for watching movies or playing music, or they could offer work facilities such as high speed internet and teleconference equipment, or even a comfortable seat for napping.', 'The possibilities for additional services cars could offer are vast, but the services have to provide something truly useful and unique for travellers, something which isn‚Äôt possible with existing smart watches, laptops and phones. Travellers don‚Äôt just want to use new fancy solutions built by car manufacturers for tasks which are possible to accomplish with existing smart devices. Nonetheless, there will likely be special use cases which warrant new digital services built by automakers.', 'The decrease in private car ownership poses a serious challenge for traditional car manufacturers. They are in danger of losing the close customer relationships they have to service-based mobility providers because in the world of service-based mobility the majority of people will have their primary relationship with a ride-hailing service instead of a car manufacturer. Therefore, car manufacturing becomes commodified and automakers‚Äô brand values dissolve, just like what happened to internet infrastructure companies. That commodification is a tough nut to crack for car manufacturers, who have been enjoying strong brand appreciation and close relationships with their customers for a long time.', 'Car manufacturers have to face this new reality and decide if they want to expand to the service business or, alternatively, stay as manufacturing companies and risk losing their direct customer contact and a large chunk of profits. Choosing the first option requires car manufacturers to take a truly customer-centric point of view ‚Äì to think what could fulfil their customers‚Äô needs and ease their pains in their everyday mobility. Following this path can lead automakers far away from their comfort zones, e.g. developing car operating systems, building their own ride-hailing services (as some of them already do), forming partnerships or designing new types of vehicles.', 'In the end, when cars aren‚Äôt a form of self-expression anymore, customers care little about who builds them ‚Äì what they care most, and have always been caring about is how to get from point A to point B as smoothly, quickly and cheaply as possible. The winners of future mobility will be those who will offer the best solutions for this seemingly simple but in reality very complex problem.']",[]

We used our very own open-source IoT service kit, a 3D-printed board game we designed to help generate ideas and bring domain experts out of their silos to co-create user-centric IoT experiences.', 'We‚Äôd been talking to Alex Taylor, Reader in Human Computer Interaction about how we might work together, he explains: ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve been really working on with the students is how to develop a space for thinking creatively. We‚Äôve put the students in the unusual (pedagogical) situation of having to work things out for themselves, of having to be creative and use their imaginations. This has been difficult for some with their experiences in more conventional learning environments that are much more procedural and structured (think the usual bookwork and exams in classroom settings).‚Äù', '', 'For Futurice, this was a perfect challenge, and something we‚Äôre used to facilitating with groups of many different types and sizes. We continually test and refine and learn more about our own abilities by teaching others.', 'To get the ideation session moving, we needed a persona. Together, we came up with ‚ÄòChung‚Äô, a busy 35-year-old professional living in East London. Each student group was then tasked to identify the places Chung might frequent the most, then to explore how IoT solutions might alleviate pain points and in those places.', 'Some very creative ideas were conceived, a few focused on improving Chung‚Äôs health and wellbeing by streamlining his daily routine using tech, some From skipping on long queues at the pub with self service, to sound-cancelling windows and walls that filter out urban noises ‚Äì the students produced some exciting concepts during the ideation phase.', ""The team from Futurice, along with their IoT Kit, really brought home how a space can be opened up for working creatively‚Äîthat offers a process, but is still open-ended and sparks the creative imagination.

https://futurice.com/blog/how-to-design-great-voice-services-for-kids,Escape the mistakes of the screen: how to design great voice services,9 Oct 2018,Emerging Tech,"Voice may well be the most natural human interface, and this is great news for the future of digital","['Brands urgently need to consider how they can stand out in this new landscape', 'Solve real problems', ""10 Design Principles for Children's Voice Services""]","[""Chances are, we‚Äôll look back in some horror at the early smart device era - the era we're now leaving; the ‚ÄòWild West‚Äô of the attention economy. Phones and tablets have shattered attention spans, addicting many of us to the dopamine hits of colour and movement, personal validation, and nuggets of information. "", 'Anxiety and depression are on the rise among the young, and the age of distraction, echo chambers and filter bubbles is well and truly upon us. The reality is staring us in the face, with a ghostly blue glow. It‚Äôs not healthy. Humans did not evolve to interact this way.', 'Voice, however, is right up there as a contender for ‚Äòmost natural human interface‚Äô and this is great news for the future of digital - a future where digital doesn‚Äôt greedily grab all of our attention but is instead is integrated into our lives; it‚Äôs there when we need it, happy to wait until the moment we do, not intruding when we don‚Äôt.', 'We already have some major players in voice, though none of these have quite cracked it yet. We are still at the stage of clunky interactions, and sometimes poor judgement as Google discovered with their natural speech robo-calling service. Microsoft has Cortana, Apple has Siri, Amazon has Alexa and their Echo range of smart speakers, Google has Home, and Facebook have just launched Aloha. There are more to come as each races to be the platform of choice.', '', ""So it's a good moment to step back and think about what we want this voice activated future to feel like, how we want these services to behave, and how organisations can get the most from them. How can we ensure that these voice services are designed respectfully, and that they do indeed deliver on the promise of being the most quintessentially human experience?"", 'We‚Äôve already seen the app ‚Äògold rush‚Äô. In June 2016 Apple‚Äôs App Store had over two million iPad and iPhone apps. Clearly they were not all in use, and a spring clean was ordered to remove spammy and outdated products. Of course there are scores of apps people find vital and useful, but every platform also has a high proportion of app landfill - unloved, unwanted, unused and perhaps unusable, or filling a need that was never really there.', 'Voice presents an opportunity to not repeat history - to solve real problems, to make something meaningful, to create long lasting value that users return to. Designing and building a voice product or service in the right way will mean that you are there just when people need you, for just what they need, both now and in the future. Some digital products and services are the equivalent of jumping up and down in front of someone a few times a day shouting ‚ÄòLook at me! Love me! Love me even more!! I‚Äôm only a toilet paper brand but love me goddamit... and help deliver on engagement KPIs that have no rationale‚Äô. If this app was a person, we would worry about them.', 'So how can organisations avoid this, and also avoid solely delivering on the agenda of the platform itself? Amazon didn‚Äôt create Alexa from a benevolent impulse, it‚Äôs a strategic play to further embed you into an ecosystem and capture more of consumers‚Äô income as well as their data. Yet there is so much potential beyond purchasing.', 'How will brands rooted in the visual realm translate to audio and retain a distinct identity? We‚Äôre about to enter a golden era for sound designers, I suspect. But there‚Äôs far more to it than that. We have to think about value, and what voice is good for.', 'If headphones are not being used, the opportunity of the voice service and the smart speaker is to be inclusive, rather than exclusive ‚Äì opening up, rather than closing down. But first we have to think about when sound is appropriate and useful, not annoying and intrusive. What are the pivotal moments where a voice service might come into play? And how does it relate to your ecosystem? After all, screens won‚Äôt disappear. When is a screen the right medium, and what should be done there? Clearly, browsing some types of product will always be a visual experience.', 'It‚Äôs early days, so let‚Äôs focus on what we know voice is good for - connecting people. And because it‚Äôs audio, we need to focus on enclosed spaces - the home and the car are good examples. The car can be included because services like Alexa exist in an app, not on the smart speaker itself, making it portable.', 'We know voice is easy to use, if designed well. Some devices have unwittingly created layers of experience - barriers like multiple remotes, multiple apps, waiting for logins, devices to boot before anything happens. In the past, you could whack a CD on and hear music within seconds ‚Äì or turn a radio on more or less instantly ‚Äì but a Sonos plus Spotify setup can mean minutes of launching apps, choosing devices, linking speakers, confusion over whose phone is connected before you hear a sound. Voice services can cut through the layers of sequential interaction clutter and bring back simplicity.', 'They also don‚Äôt always need all your attention. You can multitask - your hands are free - and you can ask incidental questions that mean voice is integrated into another activity, rather demanding to be the only activity like a screen.', 'For the price of a cheap TV commercial, a brand can create a truly useful product or service that users come back to time and time again, something that solves a real problem in their lives, or makes something troublesome easier and more delightful. For instance, imagine a recipe service integrated with grocery shopping. You could look up a recipe and tell the service how many people you are cooking for. It could adjust quantities and read the ingredient list out while you check what you have in the house. A shopping list could be created of whatever you don‚Äôt already have, and the order delivered just in time to start cooking. It then talks you through cooking the recipe step by step - complete with tips (‚ÄúAlexa, what does ‚Äòsaut√©e‚Äô mean?‚Äù) - finishing just as the meal needs to be ready. This would not be the easiest service to create, and there are some unloved early efforts already out there, but all the elements are now in place to create something truly enabling and seamless.', 'Step-by-step help is an obvious choice ‚Äì maybe even augmenting those notorious IKEA instructions ‚Äì and there is a wealth of YouTube content from that could be audio only, allowing users to focus on practical tasks while working rather than looking at a screen.', 'At Futurice, we see a key area of opportunity around voice services for families with children. This past year Kid Skills became available on Alexa in the UK and Germany giving family brands, especially those with their roots in content, the ability to be first movers. Household names have already jumped at the opportunity, from Sesame Street allowing kids to call up Elmo to National Geographic‚Äôs quiz letting kids put their geography knowledge to the test.', 'Voice, rather than splintering family attention across multiple devices, has the potential to bring families together. This isn‚Äôt a nostalgic image of families huddled around the wireless - we see new opportunities for family interaction. Any services for and involving children need to be designed respectfully and sensitively, and we also see opportunity here for providing encouragement and esteem building. There‚Äôs plenty of research that could be used to ensure voice services role model positive reinforcement in learning experiences for example, rewarding kids for effort, not results.', 'There are all sorts of moments in family life where voice services could fill a need, or relieve some difficult moments. For example, driving long distances, waiting in airports, learning new life skills, homework and exams, bedtime, when a child is home sick, when siblings are arguing, meal times, and games at the weekend. What about the ‚ÄòHelly Hansen Rainy Day Quiz‚Äô? Or perhaps an ‚ÄòRAC Bank Holiday Traffic Jam Quiz‚Äô. Or even ‚ÄòCBBC‚Äôs ‚ÄòStop arguing!‚Äô sibling argument defuser.', 'TV shows could create new and relevant content - the ‚ÄòWho Do You Think You Are?‚Äô game that encourages kids to find out about their grandparents lives and explore their family history in an entertaining format. And entertainment brands can extend the reach of their content and engagement. The BBC‚Äôs Blue Peter for instance has lots of online content that could be the basis for voice content.', ""Voice also offers the opportunity to inspire kids' imaginations in a way that screen-based experiences cannot, reconnecting them with the environment around them. Imagine a game for a long car journey that creates a story linked to what kids typically can see from a car, creating a story as they go, encouraging them to invent parts of the story and responding as they do, turning ‚ÄúI Spy‚Äù from a turgid chore into something that is exciting and different every time. And when IoT devices hit scale, the scope for inspiring the imagination with in-home adventures becomes limitless, from flickering lights to mimic lightning, to Harry Potter magic, every home will have the opportunity to become an immersive storytelling experience."", 'Organisations that already have the trust and respect of parents are well placed. The moment a brand starts trying to convert interaction with kids into sales, parents - the gatekeepers - will lose trust. So, don‚Äôt even try to monetise service like this.

And that‚Äôs a pretty big deal.",[],"['In early July 2018, our Business Director, Michael Samarin was awarded the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for the fifth year in a row. And that‚Äôs a pretty big deal.', 'MVP awards are given only to the most exceptional and passionate members of the Microsoft community. Essentially, they are a way for Microsoft to recognize and thank the most active contributors in their ecosystem, regardless of their area of expertise or form of participation. According to Microsoft, there are only around 4,000 MVPs worldwide, and at the time of writing, only 17 in Finland in addition to Michael.', 'I had a short but captivating chat with Michael about the award over a cup of coffee one afternoon. So captivating, in fact, that I was compelled to learn more ‚Äì so a day later, I sat down with Michael for a good half hour to interview him about the award, his contributions over the years, as well as the unlikely way he got involved with the Microsoft community in the first place. Keep reading to find out what he shared!', ""Lead image (above): Michael's Microsoft MVP trophy. He has six stacking year discs instead of five due to changes in the program's annual cycle over the years."", 'What is your history and personal relationship with the Microsoft community, and how did you first get awarded as a Microsoft MVP?', 'It‚Äôs an interesting journey in a way, because way back in the day I was actually the original Apple enthusiast at Futurice. I made the switch to Mac around 2001 and was fully committed to the Apple ecosystem for a long time. I used to have a hobby business around Mac software development, too, and I was also one of the people to actively push Futurice to expand into iPhone development back in 2008 when Apple first opened the Developer Program for European companies.', 'Back then, people had a hard time seeing why anyone would want to use what was essentially seen in Finland as a toy platform compared to Symbian, which was what we were largely developing for at the time (laughs). We had a very strong and long-running client relationship with Nokia, and had probably done hundreds of projects with them. But just a few short years later, Nokia made the switch to Windows Phone, and naturally we ended up doing a lot of Windows Phone development for them as well.', 'Eventually Futurice became a member of the Nokia Consultancy and Training Network. At first we did a lot of trainings around Windows Phone development for our clients, but before long I also wound up as a speaker at various developer events. I believe that‚Äôs largely why the local Microsoft team in Finland first recommended me as an MVP. This was back in 2013 when Windows Phone was still a priority for Microsoft, so they chose to give me my first MVP award.', '\nMichael on stage', 'What benefits does the award offer you?', 'The award comes with a couple of great perks, such as a full Microsoft Visual Studio subscription and some other things, but by far the most important and useful benefit is an unprecedented level of access to the Microsoft HQ in Redmond, Washington ‚Äì from individual product teams all the way to the Senior Vice President level. This is an amazing privilege. As an MVP, you have several channels and ways to get directly in touch with the engineering teams working on specific features of upcoming Windows SDK releases, or Visual Studio, and have very open and frank discussions with the team members.', 'At Microsoft, input from MVPs is valued a lot, and their teams ask for our opinions on different features or approaches very actively. So although we obviously don‚Äôt have any decision making power per se, we have the chance to influence and contribute to the choices the teams make by offering feedback. Tooling, APIs, whatever it may be, and from a consumer or developer perspective. I personally have contributed both through my work at Futurice and privately, through my hobby projects.', 'This unique access has also given me the opportunity to witness a significant shift in Microsoft‚Äôs internal company culture over the years. Having worked with quite a few of the industry giants out there, it‚Äôs amazing to see how open-minded and approachable many of their engineering teams are today, especially compared to other major vendors. And I think Microsoft doesn‚Äôt get enough credit for that openness.', 'So openness wasn‚Äôt the norm before the shift?', 'No, I don‚Äôt think so. Futurice started working more closely with Microsoft in 2011 through Nokia, and the change from that point to where we are now has been pretty visible. To give credit where credit is due, the changes already started with the previous leadership under Steve Ballmer, so you could already see some gradual results five or six years ago. But now with Satya Nadella as CEO, positive changes have been amplified and happening at an increasing rate.', '\nAt Microsoft HQ in Redmond, WA', 'You ended up in the Microsoft ecosystem through your work. What has kept you in?', 'A couple of different things. First of all, Futurice has been incredibly helpful by offering its employees the chance to travel to and attend tech conferences that are relevant to their area of expertise, and this level of participation in these developer events wouldn‚Äôt have been possible for me without the support from Futurice.', 'Secondly, I really don‚Äôt like the idea of a unidirectional world where every technology slowly converges under one massive and monolithic platform or service provider. As an MVP I‚Äôve been clearly able to see how Microsoft has changed over the years, and although I have a long history as an Apple advocate both professionally and personally, seeing the change that Microsoft has been going through has had a tremendous impact on me. Especially their approach to hardware. Whether the Surface product line has been a huge commercial success so far is up for debate, but Microsoft has made it very clear that they are in the hardware business to jumpstart emerging hardware categories and models that their partners can then pick up and build on. And I think that has worked out well for them, for example they have played a huge role in making the 2-in-1 computer a viable option in the device market.', '\nThe Futurice delegation at a Microsoft Build conference (Left to right: Riku Valtasola, Osmo Haapaniemi, Harri H√§likk√§, Jarno Montonen and Michael Samarin)', 'Personally it‚Äôs been fun to see how the tables have turned in the context of our company. Today, the majority of Futurice employees seem to prefer Macs by a pretty wide margin, so now being seen around the office with a Surface Pro suddenly makes me the rebel again, just like it used to be with Macs years ago (laughs).', 'And the third reason is related to the level of access inside the Microsoft ecosystem that I mentioned earlier. There‚Äôs a certain thrill in being able discuss the aspects and features of the Windows platform on a very technical level, directly with the engineering teams, and at the same time knowing that the input I offer has a realistic chance of actually impacting what will eventually end up in the next version of Windows development tools, or a future Windows release that will be used by hundreds of millions of people globally. That in itself is very motivating. Being connected to the amazing MVP network with thousands of other Microsoft experts around the world is also a huge privilege.', 'You got involved through your speaker gigs at developer events and your personal hobby projects. Are these still your main forms of involvement in the Microsoft community?', 'Those are still very central, yes. But over the past year and a half or so, a large share of my contribution has happened through the internal communication channels, by providing feedback to the product teams.', 'How do these exchanges with the teams typically happen?', 'These discussions take place in a variety of ways ‚Äì telcos, group discussions or one-on-one conversations. Of course there are NDAs in place, and after you are awarded as an MVP, your level of involvement and access tends to expand gradually as you build trust and make a name for yourself internally through your continued contributions over the first couple of years.', 'Depending on the topic, some of the discussions can also be very, very heated, because both the MVPs and the Microsoft engineers tend to be passionate about these things. It‚Äôs important to understand that it‚Äôs not just a bunch of people patting each other on the back ‚Äì there are real arguments from time to time. The MVPs‚Äô criticism towards Microsoft can be fairly blunt now and then, and it‚Äôs not at all uncommon for MVPs to disagree with each other considerably, either.', ""With this in mind, you have to give credit to Microsoft for being so open and able to maintain a healthy and positive attitude towards the feedback they get. It‚Äôs a very safe environment to voice your opinion, because the people involved in these discussions are trusted with real-world cases and examples under NDAs. Even certain members of Microsoft's senior leadership team are known to have open internal discussions with MVPs from time to time, and share quite detailed roadmaps that outline future release plans."", '\nMichael with Scott Hanselman, an accidental guest at an impromptu .Net meetup at the Futurice office in Helsinki', 'Is it a lot of work to participate in the Microsoft community as an MVP?', 'It depends, there are busier weeks and quieter weeks. Having worked in this industry for so many years, it‚Äôs nothing out of the ordinary. It feels very natural to participate, so while it can be intense, it has never felt like a burden. And it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre just asking things from us, the whole recognition aspect makes it a two-way street. I mean, we‚Äôre talking about what is essentially the Oscar of the Microsoft ecosystem here ‚Äì it‚Äôs a big deal in the community. There‚Äôs even a glass trophy, and they organize a summit in Redmond every year.', 'What does the MVP award mean to you?', 'It‚Äôs of course really nice to be recognized for my contributions by a Fortune 500 company, and an industry giant with a massive ecosystem. As a professional, it never hurts to get additional recognition from organizations other than your own employer. And then there‚Äôs the fact that I can just wake up in the morning and write an email to Microsoft engineers, knowing that it will actually get read and initiate an open discussion with them.', 'What does the award mean for Futurice and its clients?', 'Given the fact that there are only around 4,000 MVPs in the entire world ‚Äì and fewer than 350 across the five countries where Futurice currently operates ‚Äì it certainly doesn‚Äôt hurt to have at least one person in the company with very close ties to Microsoft. Even though some people have the habit of downplaying Microsoft‚Äôs relevance from time to time, it is still a massively influential player in the tech industry, and will remain one for the foreseeable future. A lot of the main speakers at Microsoft events are also MVPs, so whenever I‚Äôm out there giving a presentation alongside them, I‚Äôm also there representing Futurice and contributing to the fact we are seen as a versatile industry expert.', 'For our clients, I think it is very beneficial to work with a company that is vendor agnostic, and at the same time has very deep knowledge of competing ecosystems, and also connections within the industry. The tech landscape is ever-changing and multipolar, so in order to stay competitive and relevant, we have to be able to advise our clients based on extensive industry knowledge ‚Äì not just a specific narrow tech stack that we simply happen to like.', '\n""We recognize and value your exceptional contributions to technical communities worldwide.""', 'What‚Äôs next and what do you have in store for your fifth year as a Microsoft MVP?', 'Most probably it‚Äôll just be business as usual, contributing roughly the same way I‚Äôve done so far. I also still have my software hobbies that will continue to serve as a personal playground for experimenting with the newest Microsoft stacks in terms of Windows development, which will then help me give back to the community.', 'Michael will attend Dotnext Moscow in November 2018 ‚Äì if you‚Äôre around, catch him there and come say hi.', 'Read more about the Microsoft MVP award here.']",[]

New ways of working will help them evolve their thinking as well.', 'You don‚Äôt need to start from scratch in order to have an innovative work culture.

At this point I have been actively working on culture for more than a decade, and have yet to witness any correlation between age and desire or capability to learn a new working culture.', 'All that an organization needs is a positive mindset towards change, and tools that support new ways of thinking and working. And most importantly: management needs to give in order to get back later. They need to transfer part of their power to their teams and give them the ability to make their own decisions.

Companies that remain focused on creating finite products will increasingly find themselves outmanoeuvred by rivals and locked out of the bigger profits that sit further up the value creation chain.', 'The shift of focus from product to service is igniting most of the innovative work that‚Äôs currently emerging from the automotive world. Carmakers and large players in their supply chains have understood the need to step up their game and offer services that enable, complement and enhance core products. (e.g. connected car services) or that create new ecosystems around them (e.g. shared mobility services).', 'However, the business of creating successful services is one that adheres to different rules than the business of creating products. The unidimensional view of the ‚Äòtime-to-market‚Äô approach that dominates the auto sector will need to shift towards one based on long-term value generation. For traditional carmakers, this will require radical change at all organisational levels.', 'When time-to-market (TTM) strategies started to be discussed towards the end of the last millennium, they were mainly aimed at optimising already established business models by reducing the length of time it takes for a product from being created to being available for sale.', 'Because of these strategy advances, the product development cycle (PDC) of new car models dropped from over 10 years to below 4 years in the last five decades. Carmakers utilised technologies to create new variations of their products in a much faster manner, thus shortening the TTM needed for providing their customers with the promised value.', '\nExample PDC Shortening: VW Golf', 'However, with the increasing importance of services, this approach is no longer delivering the kind of value it once did. For decades, carmakers have been delivering ‚ÄúDas Auto‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Driving Machine‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Car That Cares‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Car In Front‚Äù. They have delivered a product that moved the customer from A to B and that was optimised every few years to improve that movement: becoming faster, cheaper and safer.', 'Let‚Äôs imagine however, an automotive manufacturer is moving from promising a car to promising ‚Äúmobility‚Äù to its customers. Suddenly it is not about delivering value in a certain speed, but rather making sure that the ‚Äúoverall new value‚Äù is delivered by continuously increasing the value creation. So, instead of just reducing the PDC of ‚ÄúDas Auto‚Äù, the carmaker has to make sure that other essential mobility value propositions like ‚ÄúDas Parken‚Äù (parking), ‚ÄúDas Navigieren‚Äù (navigation), ‚ÄúDas Abholen‚Äù (collection), ‚ÄúDas Pendeln‚Äù (commuting) or even ‚ÄúDas Fliegen‚Äù (flying) are being created accordingly.', 'Three of the four classic types of TTM discussed in literature are mainly about the value delivery: increasing speed, optimising scheduling and reducing required resources. Only one type (flexibility to make changes) addresses the product creation process and the ability to react to change. But even this type is usually associated with KPIs related to the product itself ‚Äì features or scope for example.', 'Because TTM was meant to improve the lifecycle of established business models, none of its four types put a real focus on the long-term value the product creates for consumers beyond the initial point of purchase.', '\nTime-To-Market Development For ‚ÄúDas Auto‚Äù', 'In order to shift thinking around the development and launch of auto products we need to move away from the more time-focused mindset and embrace a longer-term ‚ÄòValue-To-Market‚Äô (VTM) approach. With continuous validation and improvement at its heart, VTM strategies try to assess, create, validate and improve innovative services by always putting the measurement focus on the value to be created and delivered rather than on the process of creation and delivery.', 'A VTM strategy is a refocus of the assessment view to measure the perception in the outside world more carefully than internal processes.

The house will be a work-in-progress entity delivering next to zero value until the day it is completed. The tree, on the other hand, will be delivering different sorts of value (oxygen, leaves, blossoms and fruits to name a few) while still growing. The house is a deterministic value creation process, in which concepts like on-time, on-budget and quality (all time-to-market concepts) have a real place. But a tree growing is a process of continuous value creation, much like the VTM strategy carmakers must now adopt.', '\nDeterministic vs. Continuous Value Creation', 'While TTM requires a stable business model underpinning it and is assessed by product creation and delivery optimisation, a successful VTM accelerates the validation of new business models and is served by an optimised value creation chain. This chain is based on lean build-measure-learn iterations and assessed by the value increase each of these iterations delivers to the market.', 'One of the main reasons why this approach is easy for startups (almost standard operation), but rather difficult in large organisations is the established mindset in the latter which focuses all assessments on internal processes.

Especially we needed to have a lightning fast undo-redo functionality.', 'To overcome this, we decided to implement Flux application architecture with centralized state and actions modifying it. With Flux it could be easier to respond to changes following the action pattern and a possibility to time travel in the state would also make undo-redo less troublesome. After evaluating different Flux alternatives we decided to go with Redux. As Redux had kind of become the de-facto Flux implementation, it also had a good documentation, large community support with, great developer tools and also ready made redux-undo library for undo-redo functionality. Along with that we chose redux-thunk for handling asynchronous operations and ImmutableJS just to make sure our data stays untouched. Since we were using RequireJS we needed to use UMD builds for these new libraries, because they did not support AMD anymore.', 'Moving everything to Redux was a lot of work. First of all our applications had lots of data. Second, we were using Backbone Marionette as the UI layer, so we needed to build custom mechanics to respond to state changes. In addition to custom graph structure diffing we used Redux selectors with custom RxJS observables to keep our UI changing when the state changed. Also immutable data structures gave us some extra head scratching and made things maybe a bit too complicated.', 'In the end we managed to make everything work and improved performance along the way, with clear state structure to make debugging much easier.', 'As it turned out during Redux implementation, having modern libraries with AMD support is not so common anymore. RequireJS was being replaced with more versatile alternatives and browsers already had native support for ES6 modules. Also running Grunt scripts manually every time we would change our styles, took unnecessary time and created extra steps to development flow. We needed to do something about it. Enter the Webpack module bundler.', 'We formed a temporary team with one person from each application team, whose goal was to take Webpack into use. We needed to get rid of the previous RequireJS configurations and replace them with Webpack plugins. Basic migration went without major problems, but then we were faced with our custom AMD loaders, which we had built on top of RequireJS and which were quite critical to make our applications to work. These could not be handled with Webpack, since it was missing runtime module loading capabilities. Also the libraries in use with only AMD support, and unit tests with heavily mocked dependencies caused extra grey hairs.', 'Eventually we could not get rid of the custom modules, so now we have Webpack joined with RequireJS. Despite that we managed to get incremental module bundling and a possibility to use ES6 modules. We also got rid of Grunt tasks completely. No need for manual steps anymore, except for refreshing the browser to see the changes.', 'As stated before, our JavaScript codebase was huge and growing constantly, and we had many JavaScript developers. Reading and understanding each other‚Äôs code was hard. Also making changes and refactoring code was slow and error prone. We thought that static typing would bring some safety to development over dynamically typed JavaScript. While one team began their implementation of Redux based state management, they decided to add more challenge to it by adopting TypeScript.', 'Getting started with TypeScript was pretty straightforward. Setting up a preferred configuration, writing typed code, and after that compiling TypeScript files to JavaScript. Problems came mostly with external library typings and setting up common library typings to work with all the applications. With Webpack the compiling became even easier when it was done automatically during save.', 'Choosing a new UI library was the biggest decision made on our library renewal track. We had had discussions about the new library already before Redux implementation. Actual need for it came up when we noticed that Backbone Marionette was not performing very well with the Redux change-stream architecture and all the customizations that needed to be made created extra bloat. We just didn‚Äôt have the correct enablers in place before. After Webpack support was implemented we were ready to make the decision.', 'For a long time there were two candidates from currently popular UI library options, React and Vue. Both were very good libraries and either one them would‚Äôve suited our purpose. In the end React was chosen, some might say a bit accidentally. One of our application developers had implemented one larger component with React just for fun before we had officially decided to choose it. That accelerated the discussions a bit and of course we already had Redux in use which has good bindings with React so the final decision wasn‚Äôt too difficult to make.', 'To make React components work with our current Backbone Marionette UI we needed to write custom Marionette view wrappers where we injected React DOM and the components implemented with React (a good Medium article about it). As our state was already handled by Redux, mapping state to props and back could be handled without any custom RxJS observables anymore so it simplified things. Having a proper component structure already before we had React helped making it to live alongside Backbone Marionette. We could then continue our work with either one of them.', 'The last part wasn‚Äôt in any means a necessity but now that we were on a path of renewing things and had some eager developers, we decided to follow the path of Prettier. We have had Eslint in the project for linting purposes for a few years now. That still hasn‚Äôt changed the fact that developers have always argued about code styling issues, since everyone has their own opinion about it. With Prettier being opinionated code formatter, we could shut down the discussion and everyone‚Äôs code would be formatted the way Prettier wants it to be. There are minor cases which Prettier does not handle too well but Eslint covers those for us. After some initial groaning everyone have settled for what we have and the amount of code style complaints have decreased. Now we have more time to focus on the things that actually matter.', 'One year from start our frontend stack consists of Backbone Marionette, React, Redux and Typescript with Webpack module bundling with a hint of RequireJS. It certainly isn‚Äôt the simplest setup and may seem overwhelming for especially new developers but now we have enablers for continuing development using technologies from today and replacing old ones as we go forward.', 'Here are some learnings from our continuing journey renewing our frontend stack', 'Define current and planned state and steps how to get there e.g. what needs to be done first before another step can be taken']","['Make sure you gain actual benefits from changing libraries to another', 'Make sure your client is aware of pros/cons of experimenting with something new', 'Start the change with one thing/team at a time and continue from there if you get good results', 'Keep retrospectives where you share learnings and experiences', 'Document everything', 'Enjoy the ride!']"

They would like us to test using a humanoid robot in speech therapy with autistic children, working with a hospital district in the same region.', 'It would need to be able to talk in Finnish and speak some sign language. Now, would we happen to have such a robot?', 'Well, not really.', '', ""Our open source InMoov robot ‚Äì that Olli had built earlier ‚Äì sure could wave its arms about, but its fingers were too clumsy for sign language. We also had some challenges with its mechanical reliability, mostly due to how we had put it together. The controlling library wasn't very well suited for this type of purpose. Not enough precision."", 'Wouldn‚Äôt work, I thought. Too challenging. Not enough time to improve it.', 'However Olli persisted. A robot helping autistic children with sign language, though? With an actual hospital district? Trying something that hasn‚Äôt been done anywhere? Isn‚Äôt this what Chilicorn Fund ‚Äì our social responsibility program ‚Äì is all about?', 'So inevitably, after wasting some time on my hand-wringing, we took the case.', 'Fortunately our designer Minja Axelsson decided to wrap her thesis around this project. She studied the subject and planned, together with the hospital district neuropsychologist and speech therapist, how the interaction between the robot and people should play out. What the robot needs to be able to do. How it should look. Under her directions Olli and I began transforming our generic InMoov into Momo, the Friendly Sign Language Robot.', 'Luck struck twice with the hands; Open Bionics had earlier open sourced their Ada hands that seemed to do what we wanted. Then, with minimal effort, I found us a great student team from Metropolia polytechnic to build those hands. It took them a few months, but they delivered, just in time.', 'Meanwhile Olli and I had to entirely rebuild the robot‚Äôs arms with a sturdier, more reliable design. I needed to port the robot control to run on Mac, reprogram the robot, and teach it some sign language.', 'When we got the new hands attached, some time was lost trying to integrate them with the controlling software. Cannot be done, not really, not in any sensible way. So, running out of time, I discarded any pretense of professionalism and piled hack upon hack. Separate Python daemons to talk directly to the left and right hand over serial. Breaking out of the MyRobotLab‚Äôs gesture code to echo commands over netcat to those daemons.

With a world-class flicker!', 'With the individual actions resolved, how should we control the flow?', 'Minja provided a script for the session. Say hello, my name is Momo. Say I‚Äôm a robot. Look left and right. Say something else. Make the first sign language sign. Observe what happens. On cue by the speech therapist in the room, choose the next action. Thumbs up, nice try, no reaction?', 'It was less than a week to the deadline. I just made a long program file with all the actions in the script, commented them all out, and figured I‚Äôll control the robot manually by uncommenting the relevant lines, running it, commenting them again, uncommenting the next relevant lines‚Ä¶', 'And so it continues for circa 300 lines. In retrospect, do I recommend this approach? I do not. It is too easy to make mistakes while executing it.', 'To get the robot to speak Finnish, I ended up using the macOS system narrator voice called Satu. The implementation is not perfect ‚Äì our language is small, and text-to-speech and speech-to-text implementations are woefully few ‚Äì but at least you can control the pitch and rate, and add some pauses where necessary.', 'Pitch adjustment was necessary to make the voice somewhat genderless. Some words and names required creative spelling to get right; Teemu would be better written as ""tee mo"" for the text-to-speech.', 'My stress level was peaking on that weekend. Monday and Tuesday were booked for testing with the people arranged by the hospital district. Permissions had been asked, parents convinced, families had made varying travelling arrangements to the Antinkartano rehab centre in Ulvila. Just so that their children could have a brief discussion with a robot, and we could perhaps learn something.', 'Thursday night Olli was still 3D printing non-stop in his hotel room in the nearby city of Pori.', '', 'On Saturday I was alone in the hospital district site after dark, trying to program the robot to make a better sign for a ‚Äúball‚Äù, for ‚Äúflour‚Äù, for ‚Äúcat‚Äù.', 'On Sunday Minja arrived and we got to properly test the flow for the first time. To my surprise it kind of worked, but how reliable could this possibly be?', 'We already had seven cables running between the rooms. My macOS kept losing the USB hub on the robot‚Äôs back for some weird-ass reason, and the only way to get it back was to either reboot my Mac or power cycle the hub. So Olli added a separate extension power cord between the rooms just so I can restart the hub remotely. Eight cables.', 'We had to cut some corners. Minja wanted attention lights on the robot‚Äôs arm, a part of her study. I had a programmable solution in mind, but in the end I just bought a LED strip, taped it around the robot‚Äôs arm, and added yet another extension cord between the rooms so I can manually switch it on and off. Nine cables.', 'One last minute realisation was that the rehab centre WiFi was too unreliable. That compromised the tablet‚Äôs connection to my Mac‚Äôs web server. Instead of going double digits with the cables, I taped my phone on the floor of the corridor in between, to serve as a mobile hotspot between the tablet and my Mac.', 'The final touch was a small white towel nicked from the hotel, to cover the robot‚Äôs back, so that the Arduino lights would not be reflected from the window behind it, possibly distracting. I later paid for the towel.', 'Finally it was Monday morning, April 16th, 2018. A taxi was waiting at 6:30 am, the first session starting at 8 am. We had an hour to do final tests and refinements. Five minutes to eight we thought we might be ready.', 'At eight the first session started. Minja was observing the room through various camera feeds and giving me instructions on what the robot needed to do. Olli was armed with tools and more cables, ready to fix anything that would break.', '', 'A young kid was escorted into the room and sat on a chair across a table from the robot. He looked straight at the robot. Curiously? Can‚Äôt really say. Fearfully? Fortunately not ‚Äì that was my main concern.

Throughout the six sessions on the first day, and the six sessions on the second day.', 'Sure, I made a few mistakes commanding the robot. Chose a wrong line to say a few times. Misunderstood Minja‚Äôs directions. Occasionally there were uncomfortably lengthy pauses, while I was looking for the right code to uncomment. I even had to reboot the robot once in mid-session, because I clicked a few millimetres in the wrong place, and MyRobotLab jettisoned all preloaded code.', 'It was a very intense experience. My window of vision into the room was mainly through the robot‚Äôs eye camera, Minja and Olli were keeping an eye on the other cameras. When people formed an eye contact with the robot, they were looking directly at me. How will they react? What will they do? How do they feel about this? I went for walks outside to hug trees between the sessions to remain reasonably calm.', '', 'Only a few sessions didn‚Äôt run all the way through. Many were completed pretty fast, because the children decided to play along with the robot, according to the script, mimicking its movements, or trying their best.', 'One young chap even imitated the clumsy servo movement of the sign language that I had failed to perfect, for instance by making a sign for ‚Äúball‚Äù that is a bit angular towards its lower end. He did it in real-time sync with the robot, with no delay that my eye could perceive.', 'Another young gentleman didn‚Äôt so much care for the script, but instead he laughed out loud the whole session through. It was contagious. It‚Äôs hard to control a robot while laughing.', 'This was a very interesting project and I believe there‚Äôs a good chance for a more ambitious continuation with proper funding.', 'Regardless of the results, it is too early to say just how much robots can help in this area. Determining this would require proper tests running over a longer period of time. However, because we decided to invest in this spike, the likelihood of such tests taking place in the near future ‚Äì with public funding, perhaps ‚Äì is now that much higher.', 'This is the kind of value creation companies like Futurice are well equipped to do. We can experiment with emerging technology, with our lean user-centric approach, on real social challenges that carry a high potential for impact. The advances in recent years in 3D printing and cheap (IoT driven) electronics now make it easier for us to include hardware components in our projects, such as the robot, and modify those as necessary. Open-source hardware is a very interesting domain, and I believe it will have a big impact on innovation in robotics. We will find ways to contribute to that.', 'I am happy and proud we have been able to do a project like this. I believe we will continue on this path.', 'And finally, a video clip.

Every year the whole company has a chance to meet, share and hang out in a European city for a weekend. It‚Äôs the big occasion from which we draw our energy, reflect on how far we‚Äôve come, what we want to achieve, and where we pull together to help each other out as we grow towards the next evolution.', 'Lots has changed since last year: a new CEO, a new studio in Oslo, new Board members, more client successes, more learnings, more insights into what it means to be Futurice wherever we work and live.', 'The theme for this year‚Äôs meeting in the heart of Berlin was Futupolis, inspired obviously in large measure by Fritz Lang‚Äôs expressionist science-fiction masterpiece Metropolis. Visually, thematically, and even theatrically through lighting, sound design and exquisite art direction, for 48 hours we lived in a temporary city of our own creation. A day of keynotes, networking, demonstrating, debating and dancing; then a second day of experiencing Berlin, partying and chilling by the river.', 'Six weeks into his new role as CEO,  Teemu Moisala opened proceedings  reflecting on where we‚Äôd come from - our heritage in open source and mobile, the bets we‚Äôd made in the past, and how we are now aiming high with a vision of leading the way in AI. He pointed to our culture - empowering ways of working - as being the alchemy  that will get us there. Watching Teemu survey a hall of 450 people all with massive collective learnings and a burning desire to shape the future was a big emotional moment.', '', 'Next came senior data scientist Daryl Weir and lead service designer Annina Antinranta. It‚Äôs easy to get stuck in dystopia, and cultural tropes almost enforce a sense of fear about technology; equally the utopian path is almost too idealistic and visionary for most to fully embrace. Instead, as we increasingly embrace AI, Protopia feels like a wise approach, a way of being where we continuously work to make things better and to learn.This involves going beyond ideology in order to  balance practicality and vision. Being more human about AI means helping understand what went into the decisions that surround us - people‚Äôs creative processes, their inspirations.', 'Our event featured some of our clients too - our massive company offsite is a place where our clients are welcome - this year we welcomed Niina Sauvolainen from Finnair, Telina Reil from Allianz and Jussi Herlin from Kone. Niina gave us a look behind the scenes of a project she‚Äôs been working on with Futurice with head of innovation and biometrics expert Tugberk Duman on facial recognition. The point was to illustrate just how tricky it can be to have the drive and vision to experiment and try out new things, while managing corporate expectations, safety and security imperatives and significant pressure for ROI. Niina described her own journey of seeking to embrace change in the organisation and constantly running into cultural norms which are designed to help Finnair maximise returns while transporting millions of people in perfect safety. Not easy, and an important reminder to our creative and experimental natures within Futurice, that the people we work with day by day live a very different reality. But embracing   our clients‚Äô reality is the key to getting our experiments out there in front of real people: we just have to be patient and empathise with the corporate contexts in which most of the world works.', 'Next on stage was a panel debate. Instead of asking the audience open questions and getting nervous open-mic moments, we used the fantastic Mentimeter online polling service to ask the audience some questions about AI. This allowed our panel consisting of Niina Sauvolainen from Finnair and Telina Reil from Allianz  together with key Futurice people including  ethics lead Minna Mustakallio,  design director Melanie Dreser,  innovation lead Tugberk Duman and Miikka Ermes, Data science lead, to respond with the findings with their perspectives and remarks.', 'This approach proved mind expanding. We reflected on what skills we are lacking in our work in AI (philosophy, psychology, ethics, sociology), what excited people about the field, what made people nervous,  what people wanted to see more of‚Ä¶ The panel reached a real crescendo when reflecting on whether in fact psychology could in fact be replaced. Technically, with the right programming and learning, machines could do a better job of making sense of human behaviours and thoughts than humans can.. It‚Äôs all very techno-utopian, but the discussion definitely surfaced some important tensions that we‚Äôll continue to try to make sense of.', 'For many, the highlight of the day was a talk by Zeynep Tufekci, writer, academic and techno-sociologist and regular contributor at The Atlantic and The New York Times. It was an incredibly eye opening talk, which picked apart popular notions of the infallibility of computer systems, the inbuilt gender and diversity biases of most systems around us, the nature of teaching and learning with machines, the very human biases which lead us to assume that computers will think like smarter humans. Each point was built up, debunked and explored with style and panache, and left the audience in no doubt about the importance of Futurice taking a bold stance on AI and exploring as many semi hidden factors as possible in our work.', 'Following on from Zeynep and looking inwards at what the AI future holds for us as a company,  our chief artificial intelligence officer Tuomas Syrj√§nen, VP Claes Kaarni and I described a near future learning journey for all of Futurice. We could describe this more, but that would be giving a lot away :).

For the first time in recorded Futu-history, this was their moment. It‚Äôs a powerful story, summarised well by Mikko himself in three points: 1) Humans are fundamentally good; 2) Optimism - we can use technology to solve the biggest problems and 3) Realism - there are no silver bullets. Some deeply personal reflections from three people who, looking out at a crowd of 450 coming from 5 studios across Europe, must have felt just a little twinge of pride at how their vision has become reality.', 'Their talk culminated in a bold summary of what we are in Futurice: A 100 year, metamodern, social experiment.

Then, it embraces the challenges in society coming out of a postmodern, cynical, relativist age into one defined more by oscillations between perspectives, storytelling and interconnectedness.

At the heart of the Twitch community are its 2.2 million broadcasters, thousands of which stream titles like League of Legends, Overwatch, Hearthstone and Fortnite on a daily basis ‚Äì in front of an audience of 15 million daily viewers. ', 'As many as 27 000 video creator partners make money from their videos. Those are big numbers. The bulk of their audience is from the 18‚Äì34 age group, so this is by no means a teenage fad. Competitors are relatively few and far between, and they have a hard time trying to keep up.', 'Twitch offers a platform that allows content creators to reach their audience with ease and, thanks to its recently revamped monetization scheme, enables a growing share of the streamers to also make money from it. Advertising is pretty much an integral part of Twitch streams, with the most dedicated fans willing to pay tens of dollars just to support the work of their favorite streamer. For the vast majority of businesses or social platforms, loyalty like that is nothing short of a pipe dream.', '', 'For a relic from the Music Television era, such as myself, the most natural way to evaluate new cultural phenomena is to compare them to ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì MTV. MTV was the first one to successfully build a (loose) global community around young people‚Äôs passion for music, and so throughout the 80s and 90s, music was the common denominator that brought teens and young adults together. Video games had their devoted fan base at that time, too, but due to several factors, including their subject matter and the way they were marketed, the vast majority of consumers viewed them exclusively as a thing for kids. Casual gaming in its current form didn‚Äôt really exist yet for the adult demographic, so for them, playing games carried a social stigma.', 'Thankfully, that notion is now largely in the past. As a direct result of the rise of casual and mobile gaming, all of a sudden games and gamers are found... well, pretty much everywhere and in all age groups. As gaming has become mainstream, Twitch has become the MTV for the gaming generation. Today, game companies introduce their new titles with interactive live streams ‚Äì played by members of the developer team itself. The level of community interaction is on a level many companies could only dream of earlier.', 'Twitch is also becoming a threat to incumbent live streaming services like YouTube, Facebook Live, and Periscope, all brands owned by some of the largest names in the tech industry. Just when you thought the bulk of the live streaming business was already distributed between these giants ‚Äì boom ‚Äì a new niche contender emerges out of nowhere and starts gaining ground. Even prominent YouTube stars like Casey Neistat have expressed views that YouTube is in fact vulnerable to Twitch. And within the gaming domain itself, Twitch has a growing user base whereas YouTube Gaming is actually shrinking.', 'But its impact is not limited just to the platform business. Twitch, and the whole live streaming culture, has been a substantial driving force behind some significant changes in game design. Multiplayer has been a staple for years or even decades depending on the genre, but now various developers have started to prioritize multiplayer over single player, or even abandon the single player component altogether ‚Äì even in massively popular and valuable IPs like Call of Duty.', 'Streaming has also contributed to microtransactions becoming more commonplace and gaining foothold on consoles. Fortnite, for example, is free to play on all platforms, but on mobile alone, its add-ons are grossing more than titles like Candy Crush Saga and Clash of Clans. The interesting part is that they are simply cosmetic upgrades ‚Äì there are no controversial loot box gambling schemes or items that boost your in-game performance or character development. It‚Äôs all about enabling dedicated players to customize their own experience and reflect their own personality. These in-game purchases ‚Äì most notably the victory dance animations ‚Äì have also become a popular subject of fan-made Youtube videos. Much like Nokia phones‚Äô ringtones at the turn of the millennium, the dance animations have become a thing not by design but by some other force that every product manager on the planet would be willing to die for.', ""When famous streamer Ninja set out to play Fortnite together with rap artist Drake, the two reached an audience of over 600 000 viewers. Numbers like these rival many prime time TV shows ‚Äì and in 2018, someone streaming from their home with an interesting enough guest line up can reach them. Humbling moment. A while later, NFL star JuJu Smith-Schuster and rapper Travis Scott also joined Drake and Ninja for a squad game. The chance to combine the fan bases of NFL, Hip-Hop music and eSports into one stream would be any marketing professional‚Äôs wet dream, and its combined impact is enormous. There are other, older examples of celebrity gaming stunts, for example Conan O‚ÄôBrien‚Äôs tongue-in-cheek video game sessions with celebrity guests, but that is a completely different case. Pop culture crossovers like this have never been seen before, and in the future, this domain is only going to grow from what we've seen so far."", 'It is also worth mentioning that Fortnite was inspired by another game, PlayerUnknown‚Äôs Battlegrounds, or PUBG ‚Äì so much so, in fact, that the creators of the latter initially considered taking legal action against Fortnite for replicating their IP. The major superficial difference is that Fortnite has a much more cartoony visual style. Within the streaming community, Fortnite is already drawing more than twice the viewer counts that PUBG is attracting. It should also be noted that Fortnite costs nothing to play, while PUBG sells for approximately 30 EUR/USD.', ""What's in it for me?"", 'When acquiring Twitch, Amazon already saw this coming, but countless other companies have been completely blindsided. They missed the platform train, and most of them are now depending on the ones that eventually divide the market for brand visibility. The entire video game live streaming business has turned out to be a much bigger revolution than anticipated: eSports is now a legitimate profession. In Finland, schools are actually offering courses on eSports and instructing on how to gain sponsorships. And quite a few Finnish players can now be found in top tier professional Overwatch teams.', 'As with most emerging platforms, the gains can be enormous, but the same applies to losses as well. At this point, Twitch is providing good value for companies with the right message. However, the community is highly critical, so your message needs to be authentic and meaningful to the audience ‚Äì otherwise they will just resent it, and maybe even turn it against you.', 'Twitch is an immensely entertaining platform. If you haven‚Äôt yet, I really recommend that you check it out on your preferred device. Spend an hour or two just browsing thru the streams (late evenings and nights in Europe are usually the busiest times, since a good chunk of the most popular streamers are based in the US). Try to get a feel of the community and figure out what motivates people to stream their gaming sessions, what constitutes and entertaining stream, what drives the fans to voluntarily donate money to the content creators, and how it all ties together.', 'When you think you‚Äôve gotten your head around this pop culture phenomenon, don‚Äôt stop there. The important part is figuring out whether these paradigms could support your daily work or benefit your business. The victory dance comes after that.']",[]

The video showcases aspects such as the field of view and spatial mapping capabilities of each device. This post is aimed at providing insight into the experiential side of using each device, and the experience of developing for them. Together these two viewpoints should provide a complete picture of why I see the HoloLens as the device worthy of more interest at this time.', 'Let‚Äôs begin with one of the fundamental aspects of a headset: How it is worn on the head. The HoloLens and the Meta 2 have two quite different approaches to supporting the weight of the headset. Let‚Äôs begin by looking at how the HoloLens does it.', '', 'As can be seen from the above image, the weight of the HoloLens is supported in two ways: by an adjustable headband and a nose rest. Shown is also how the headband can be rotated according to preference, changing how the weight is distributed.', 'Of these two, the nose rest is the one with the biggest tradeoffs. On the positive side, the nose rest makes the HoloLens very stable on the head, helps keep the viewable area in a spot that feels very natural to look at, and makes it easy to place it in the same position each time. On the other hand, the nose rest is, both in my own experience and the experience of many others who have tested it, the biggest source of discomfort ‚Äì more on that a bit later in this post. It can also make it difficult for people with glasses to comfortably use the HoloLens.', '', 'The above image illustrates how the Meta 2 is supported by a longitudinal strap on top of the head, an adjustable band that goes around the head, and a pad that rests on the forehead. How comfortable this setup is to the user seems to vary depending on the shape of the person‚Äôs head. I have a relatively large head and personally feel like the device wants to slide down my forehead, forcing me to tighten the headband quite a bit. On the other hand, others with smaller heads than mine have commented that it feels quite stable.', 'I will discuss the display itself in more detail in the next section, but I will mention here that the image quality of the Meta 2 is heavily dependent on the placement of the headset. For a clear image, you are required to place the headset quite far down on your forehead ‚Äì forcing you to adjust the headset based on image quality first and comfort second. Also, this causes the main viewable area to be placed in a spot where I feel like I‚Äôm constantly looking down at things.', 'A note also has to be made of the Meta 2‚Äôs cable. Unlike the HoloLens, the Meta 2 isn‚Äôt self-contained and has to be attached to a separate computer. Personally, I find it extremely frustrating. The 9 foot (~2.7 meter) cable is in practice quite short and severely restricts the area within which you can operate. It is also really easy to step on. These two together mean that at any given time, part of your attention has to be on the whereabouts of the cable, and not straying too far away from the computer.', '', 'The HoloLens and the Meta 2 use very different technologies for displaying their holographic images. Starting with the HoloLens, it uses two holographic lenses, which are actually waveguides that transport light through the lenses. These are made up of 3 layers, one for each color component (red, green, and blue). The light is then extracted out of the lenses using so-called Surface Relief Gratings, sub-wavelength gratings that bend the light in the correct direction. The full details of how the system works can be found here.', '', 'The technology used by the Meta 2 is much more straightforward. It has a single display above the visor that points down (see the image above). The image from the display is then reflected to the user‚Äôs eyes via the surface of the semi-spherical visor.', 'One of the most obvious aspects the choice of technology impacts is the field of view (FoV) of the device. This is also one of the major selling points of the Meta 2 compared to the HoloLens. The Meta 2 sports a 90¬∞ FoV, compared to the 30¬∞ of the HoloLens. For a demonstration of the FoV of each device, please refer to this post‚Äôs video companion.', 'In practice, I didn‚Äôt find the larger FoV of the Meta 2 to improve my experience too much, for two main reasons. First, as mentioned earlier the Meta 2 has to be placed quite low on your forehead. This means that the vertical FoV is almost entirely dedicated to seeing things at the same level with your eyes and below. If you want to look at something above eye-level, you will have to crane your neck to tilt your head up. Second, when using the Meta 2, objects are supposed to be within arm‚Äôs reach ‚Äì literally ‚Äì since you interact with objects directly by grabbing them. The HoloLens, on the other hand, expects objects to be roughly 2 meters away from the user. So the amount of the visible FoV that an object occupies is roughly equal.', 'As was mentioned earlier, the quality of the image when using the Meta 2 is heavily dependent on the positioning of the headset, and even small changes in position can cause the image to become blurry and/or distorted. This becomes frustrating after a while, especially as a developer since I have to take the headset off and put it back on several times over the course of a day. The HoloLens in comparison is very forgiving when it comes to placement and has the nose rest to help place the headset correctly.', '', 'The experience of looking through each device is also quite different. As seen above, the main discontinuity in the FoV of the HoloLens stems from the edges of the lenses. This is mitigated by the fact that the visor is so close to your eyes that they are close to your peripheral view. The Meta 2, on the other hand, has a very fragmented feel to the field of view. The darkened area where the images are shown is very prominent, and at the edges, where the visor curves backwards, there is some very distracting refraction going on.', 'One thing that surprised me when comparing the devices was the difference in the ‚Äúphysicality‚Äù of the images they produce, in the absence of a better word. To truly understand this difference you have to experience it by looking through one headset and then immediately switching to the other one, but I will do my best to explain it. When looking at a hologram produced by the HoloLens it really looks like it exists in the same space as the physical objects around it; my eyes focus on it just as effortlessly as they do on the real objects around it, and I feel very comfortable giving an estimate of its actual position in the world. With the Meta 2 it feels more like I‚Äôm just watching a 3D image on a transparent screen and I have to actively switch between looking at the image and the world around it. When using the Meta 2, I also experience eye strain similar to when I use VR glasses, which amplifies the experience that I‚Äôm not looking at something that really exists.', 'At this point I have worn both of these devices for extended periods of time, up to 2 hours in a row, on several occasions. And while neither device is particularly pleasant to wear for that long, I still prefer the HoloLens, as the discomfort is only physical. The HoloLens weighs just over 0.5kg, and a decent amount of that weight is supported by the nose. This constant pressure on the bridge of the nose can at times cause headaches.', 'Physically, the main source of discomfort when wearing the Meta 2 is the the constant pressure on your forehead. Though unpleasant, it alone is still better than the pressure on your nose from the HoloLens. The real discomfort is caused by a combination of eye strain, the fragmented FoV, as well as the instability of the spatial tracking, which is demonstrated in the companion video. After long development sessions I found myself feeling slightly disoriented, reminiscent of the feeling you get after spending a long time on a boat and getting back on land.', 'Displaying virtual objects is all well and good, but more often than not, the point is also to interact with them. The Meta 2 and HoloLens have gone with very different ways of doing this. With the Meta 2 you directly grab objects with your hand(s), while with the HoloLens you use a combination of gaze (i.e. the direction your head is pointing) and gestures. For a demonstration of how these interactions work in practice, see the companion video. Here I will focus on one often overlooked aspect: reliability.', 'Whatever else you may want to say about the gesture-based system used by the HoloLens, it is extremely reliable. Because of this it never feels like you have to fight the device to make it do what you want. The interaction experience is therefore mainly reliant on your ability to make use of the data provided to you by the HoloLens.', 'The same cannot be said for the Meta 2. The base interaction is very simple and intuitive. Just stretch out your open hand and close it into a fist when you want to grab something. The problem is that the actual hand tracking is extremely temperamental. Sometimes it loses track of your hand as you make a fist. Sometimes it detects non-existent hands. Sometimes it registers grabs even though your hand is open. Overall it just feels like you have to fight the device for it to cooperate.', 'Having discussed the physical devices, let‚Äôs take a look at what it is actually like to develop for each device. To begin with, let‚Äôs assume you are interested to start developing for one of these devices. What resources are currently available to help you get started?', 'I want to begin by noting that I do not expect there to really be any third party resources for the Meta 2, simply based on how new it is. Therefore what I will be looking at is the official support provided by the manufacturers ‚Äì Microsoft for the HoloLens, and Meta for the Meta 2 ‚Äì and the resources they provide. And also, on this front I do not expect as many resources from the side of Meta, considering the difference in size of the companies and the maturity of the product.', 'Having said all that, I have to be honest and say I am still extremely disappointed by the resources offered by Meta. Or, more specifically, the imbalance between design and technical resources. To illustrate this, let‚Äôs first take a look at the resources offered for the HoloLens.', '', 'The amount of resources provided by Microsoft is immense. As an example, just going through the Academy, each lesson contains several multi-minute videos guiding you through development, detailed step-by-step lists explaining what to do, and the complete code for the central scripts. And that‚Äôs just the basic tutorials that help you get up to speed. Now, let‚Äôs look on the side of Meta.', '', 'Shown above is the page that contains all Meta‚Äôs documents related to designing for the Meta 2. This actually along the lines of what I would expect ‚Äì perhaps even exceeding my expectations a little ‚Äì for a company this size and such a new product. For the most part, the content is actually really interesting, connecting the design guidelines with research done in neuroscience. But design is only one part of development. You also have to implement your designs. So what resources does Meta provide for teaching the actual development?', '', 'A single tutorial. And the tutorial page itself doesn‚Äôt even contain the actual tutorial, instead linking to this blog post. The tutorial itself is a 10-minute video that contains less subject matter than almost any single tutorial in the Mixed Reality Academy. Beyond that, all you have to go by is the SDK Features section ‚Äì which doesn‚Äôt do much more than list how things work and some best practices ‚Äì and/or the example scenes provided, which provide help just one step above ‚Äúread the source code‚Äù.', 'Taking all of this together I get this weird impression that Meta doesn‚Äôt seem too interested in developers like me actually developing apps for the Meta 2. This is further compounded when I try to answer the question ‚ÄúWhere can I publish my app and find apps done by other people?‚Äù', 'If I google ‚Äúmeta 2 app store‚Äù the first result I get is this article promising an upcoming, dedicated store. That was two years ago, and apps are still nowhere to be found. In comparison, googling ‚Äúhololens app store‚Äù gives a direct link to Microsoft‚Äôs store that conveniently lists all HoloLens apps.', 'Moving on to the issue of actually developing applications, the main way of developing for both devices is by using Unity. Both are easy to get started with, though the HoloLens is a bit more streamlined.', 'The only requirement for starting development for the HoloLens is that Visual Studio is installed. This is required since VS is used to deploy applications to the HoloLens. Beyond that, all you need to do is to change a couple of settings and technically you have a working HoloLens app ‚Äì albeit one without any functionality.', 'For the Meta 2, you first have to download the SDK from Meta‚Äôs site. After installing the SDK you can import a Unity package containing all the needed assets. Once that‚Äôs done, you simply delete the default camera in the scene and drop in the camera prefab provided by the Meta SDK. At this point you have a working Meta 2 app, but with no functionality other than being able to scan the environment.', 'One definitive advantage of the Meta 2 is the fact that you can run it directly in the editor, without any special arrangements. This makes iterating much faster and easier. Although it is possible to use Remote to Device for similar debugging with the HoloLens, Remote to Device is not always entirely reliable. And since Remote to Device doesn‚Äôt run the application on the HoloLens you still have to deploy it to ensure everything works correctly.', 'When coding for each device I far preferred to code for the HoloLens. I found the whole Meta 2 SDK to be a bit messy, especially in comparison with the HoloLens APIs. This comes down to two main factors. First, as mentioned earlier, the lack of tutorials and general technical resources made it hard to form a clear picture of what development patterns to use. The result of this is that I felt like I didn‚Äôt have a good picture of all the parts of the system, which ones I should care about, and where to go if I want to customise functionality. Second, support for the HoloLens is built directly into Unity. Therefore functionality is exposed following the same kinds of patterns I‚Äôm already used to in Unity. The exposed functionality is also, on average, on a slightly lower level, making it easier for me to build my own system around that functionality. This kind of approach of course places a bit more burden on the developer when starting up a new project, but personally I find it worth it.', 'Let me now bring together all the things I have discussed to explain why I feel that the HoloLens is the more interesting device at the moment. I will also refer to some of the conclusions I‚Äôve reached in the companion video to paint a complete picture. I strongly suggest watching the video if something seems unclear.', 'Let‚Äôs begin with a very straightforward issue: price. The HoloLens is currently priced at $3000. But that‚Äôs it, it contains everything you need. The Meta 2 clocks in at $1995, but that is assuming you already have the computer capable of supporting it. If you need to upgrade your computer then the price can quickly start climbing closer to the same level as the HoloLens.', 'Let‚Äôs move on to the viewing experience. The only real advantage the Meta 2 has over the HoloLens is an improved field of view and more rendering power. Over time, I find that these are of far less importance than hologram stability, convincing mixing with the real world, and the ‚Äúphysicality‚Äù discussed earlier in this post. These are what create the illusion of a truly Mixed Reality.', 'Though I think neither device‚Äôs interaction system is adequate, I would still choose the HoloLens over the Meta 2. The need for everything to be close enough to grab with your hand(s) simply limits the possible use cases too much ‚Äì especially combined with the fact that the cable restricts the area in which you are able to operate. And this is not even mentioning how unreliable the Meta 2‚Äôs tracking is.', 'Speaking of being tethered ‚Äì to me, this is an absolutely massive downside. Reading articles on the internet, I constantly see people saying they are happy to trade being tethered for having more processing power. I could not disagree more. Most really interesting use cases require you to move around a lot and/or using the device somewhere other than your workstation.', 'When it comes to spatial mapping there really is no contest. The HoloLens allows you to map and produce a model of the real world ‚Äì up to 3 meters away ‚Äì while running in the background. With the Meta 2, you have to explicitly tell the device to do the same, and it only has a range of up to approximately a meter.', 'It‚Äôs good to also consider how all of these factors reflect on potential future releases. The base for the HoloLens is really strong, with strong spatial tracking capabilities, reliable gesture recognition, and already being tetherless. The main features that need improving is expanding the FoV, adding more processing power, and expanding gestures and hand tracking.', 'The Meta 2 on the other hand‚Ä¶ There are actually very few things I consider to be at an acceptable level. First of all, it needs to become tetherless. That means finding a way to pack all these specifications into the headset. Then it needs a display this is actually pleasant to watch. Spatial and head tracking needs to be improved so that objects aren‚Äôt constantly moving around. Hand tracking needs to be reliable enough that it doesn‚Äôt feel like I have to fight to do what I want to. And so on and so forth.', 'So there you have it. The reasons why I think the HoloLens is still the device to beat. My biggest takeaway from this entire experience is a new-found appreciation for how great an achievement the HoloLens actually is. And now I will wait to see if the next hyped up contender, the Magic Leap One, will be able to dethrone the HoloLens. Or maybe the next version of the HoloLens is what I should actually be looking forward to.']",[]

For this, I turned to Joi.","['Setting Up', 'The Basics', 'Validating Strings', 'Validating Numbers', 'Validate Against Data References', 'Conditional Validation']","['I‚Äôll be honest, despite all of my experience as a front-end developer I haven‚Äôt had a lot of projects that dealt heavily with forms and data. Form validation was just something I never really had to work with much. My most recent project, however, is entirely form- and data-driven and I needed a way to easily handle front-end validation. For this, I turned to Joi.', 'Joi is a validation library that allows you to build schemas to validate JavaScript objects. And what that generally means to me is Joi provides methods to easily validate common data types, such as e-mail addresses and phone numbers. But I‚Äôve also learned that it allows you to easily validate less common data and complex data structures.', 'And it was here, in Joi‚Äôs simplification of complex validation, where I found the urge to share what I‚Äôve learned.', 'For this project, which consisted of React, Redux, and TypeScript, the validation needed to occur on the front end in the browser. Because of this I leveraged both Joi and Joi-Browser.', 'With the libraries installed Joi can be imported into your validation file and the writing of schemas can begin.', 'When validating with Joi, two pieces of data are needed:', '1) The data object to validate\n2) The Joi schema', 'An optional third argument could be supplied to customise the validation behaviour but I won‚Äôt be covering that in this post.', 'This particular project consisted of multiple forms with general information fields\u200a‚Äî\u200athe user‚Äôs name, address, e-mail, and phone number. These fields are pretty straight forward and quite fittingly so is the validation.', 'Let‚Äôs take a look at an example of some data:', 'With this general data structure, we can begin writing our Joi schema for validation. Let‚Äôs begin with the strings.', 'One thing I really like about Joi is how it reads. From the schema above it is pretty clear to see what we‚Äôre expecting of each property. Additionally, by adding the required() method we can quickly organise important data while being able to double up on the required property on form fields themselves for extra security.', 'The address field, however, required additional consideration. While living in the States I didn‚Äôt think much about additional characters outside of our alphabet. Having moved to Finland, though, made me realise that I must now account for values that have characters such as √Ñ√§ and √ñ√∂. Luckily, Joi provides additional ways to support such circumstances.', 'The schema above introduces a couple nice options. First, the trim() method will remove any trailing spaces from the value. The max() method is also used to limit the length of the value to 100 characters.', 'But the primary method I‚Äôd like to draw attention to here is regex(). This method allows greater control over what values are supported\u200a‚Äî\u200avirtually extending the default string() validation and adding custom behaviour on top.', 'If you had noticed, our data object stores the phone number as a string. Let‚Äôs see how we can leverage the regex() method in our schema for this case.', 'By using the regex() method here, we can validate the string to ensure its value is 7‚Äì10 characters all of which fall between 0 and 9.', 'But you won‚Äôt always be storing phone numbers as strings. Eventually, validation for number fields will need to written and Joi makes this just as direct.', 'Let‚Äôs look at the following example data:', 'Assuming we‚Äôre looking for users between the ages of 18 and 65 our schema could look like the following:', 'Again, the readability of Joi is a big selling point as the use of the min() and max() methods quickly convey how we‚Äôre validating our data.', 'However, we won‚Äôt always have such defined ranges like 18 and 65. So how can data be validated against other data values?', 'In this particular project, which deals with applying for a loan, the user is asked to specify both their total wealth as well as their total savings and investments. Because a person‚Äôs savings is part of their total wealth, the savings field should never be greater than the totalWealth value.', 'But since we won‚Äôt know those values until the time of validation, Joi provides the ref() method for situations exactly like this.', 'Inside of the max() method the value of totalWealth is referenced by using Joi‚Äôs ref() method and passing in the key of the target field. With this schema our data object would error.', 'There‚Äôs a fair chance you‚Äôve either used or built a form with conditional fields. For example, why show the user fields concerning credit card debt if the user selected ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to owning any credit cards? Our validation should follow the same logic\u200a‚Äî\u200aonly validate certain fields when other criteria is met.', 'With the data model above and understanding our need for conditional validation, let‚Äôs look at our Joi schema.', 'In this example, the when() method is leveraged. Again, Joi reads quite clearly\u200a ‚Äî \u200awhen hasCreditCards is true then validate using the following schema.', 'But let‚Äôs say we wanted to expand our data model to include an array of credit card objects, all containing their own individual values.', 'In this case, we have an array with a variable number of objects that we need to validate only if the user hasCreditCards. Let‚Äôs start with what we know:', 'Again, using the when() method, we can conditionally validate the allCreditCards array. The next step is to validate the individual properties of each object within the array.', 'By using the items() method, we define the contents of the array. In this specific case, the items are an object but this method can support any combination of comma-separated Joi schemas.', 'For example, if our array would only contain a required string and an optional number our schema could look like this:', 'Back to our original credit card example, though. Let‚Äôs say we want to have more control over which credit card providers are supported. For example, my Discover card isn‚Äòt accepted anywhere in Finland (like literally, anywhere!). So how could we write our validation to include and/or exclude particular values?', 'By using the valid() and invalid() methods greater control can be applied to the validation. This can be nicely paired with enum values as well.', 'Now, for it all together.', 'Cue the record scratch because yet again I love how quickly this can be read and understood. My hat goes off to the work done with the naming within Joi.', 'Joi is capable of doing so much more than what I‚Äôve covered here and luckily, their documentation found here is terrific. I feel this project has given me a great crash course on validation and using Joi to do some things that would otherwise be quite challenging.', 'Well done, Joi.']",[]

https://futurice.com/blog/an-approach-to-software-production-part-2,An Approach to Software Production - Part 2,17 Mar 2018,Learning,This is the second part of a three part series of articles discussing a broad approach for developing software in an enterprise context.,"['Integrate Early', 'Managing the Backlog', 'Release Fast', 'Conclusion']","['In part one I discussed the first two aspects of an approach to software production - co-creation and team setup. In this article I will discuss the next considerations: integrations, managing the backlog of tasks and getting your releases out the door pronto.', 'System integration is often one of the most painful exercises a software developer can do. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs integrating a front end with a backend or some legacy subsystem, integration usually involves more than just software development. It also involves strong communication and problem solving abilities. It‚Äôs best to make integration continuous - from both automated and human perspectives.', 'Our self organising, vertically organised teams start integrating from the get go. As explained we actively encourage cross functional teams that include design, front end developer and back end developers. This creates an environment that fosters strong communication and collective ownership of the entire system - a massive gain in terms of productivity, team member involvement and commitment. The subtlety here is that any member of the team can fix the problems they find - if they can. This is not about who owns what. This is about building the system in an environment where the lines of ownership are blurred. With this in mind, members are empowered to integrate ‚Äúas they go‚Äù.', 'It‚Äôs not just the team setup that supports integration. We also make ample use of continuous integration (CI) tools such as Jenkins, Circle CI and others - depending on the choices of the team. Continuously integrating in an automated fashion is important because it catches problems early. As code is committed into the source code tree, a suite of tests are run against the code base and problems reported. Errors are found immediately and fixed quickly. With this in mind, developers can be sure that they are integrating, and thus minimising future problems, as early as possible. This shorter feedback cycle makes big sense.', 'In the traditional waterfall model, deliverables are managed based on the scope and deadlines (milestones) of the project. Many things tend to be ongoing at any one time and deadlines inevitably lead to a final crunch time as cutoffs loom large. Multiple tasks are often thrown at developers and it is up to them to keep it under control. The unfortunate side effect of this situation is that team members become less productive, shortcuts are taken to get it ‚Äúout the door‚Äù and ultimately a reduction in output quality is realised.', 'Another unintentional side effect of this mode of operation is an increase in complexity. With high levels of work in progress (WIP) the need to manage inter-dependencies and regression quickly emerges. Think about this, if we are working on many incomplete tasks it is only logical that it takes longer to achieve a complete working body of work. This means release cycles tend to be (much) longer than if we fully complete small bodies of work in a focused way (low WIP) and release as we go.', 'Maintaining a minimal backlog of WIP is a key point to understand because the cost of processing change is expensive.. In many projects and indeed in many aspects of life, the longer the list of things to do the more difficult it becomes to stay focused on the task at hand. It is too easy to context switch to a more ‚Äúenjoyable‚Äù task. When we context switch, we lose time and the fidelity of thought. Cognitively we simply can‚Äôt seamlessly move from one task to another. Context switching must be minimised if optimal output is to be achieved.', 'Let me put it another way, no one can do more work than they can handle. Seeing this statement written down makes it seem obvious however in practice it is not so simple. Managing the backlog of stories and tasks being worked on is a critical skill for ensuring maximal development speed. Let‚Äôs get one thing straight, where possible we avoid parallel development that might see a team working on a large number of stories/tasks at any given time. It‚Äôs more than we (as humans) can handle. Thus, our goal with backlog management is to keep WIP to an absolute minimum.', 'With the aim of minimising context switching through lower levels of wip, new tasks can then only be pulled by developers based on the story and task priority and the ability to complete. The traditional system sees new work pushed onto the developer regardless of where they are. Our way is to pull tasks when the developers are ready and to maintain that flow of tasks moving through the system. It‚Äôs a subtle yet very important difference.', 'Returning again to our scope driven waterfall model that has traditionally occupied the software development space, traditional projects tend to be managed in order to deliver the scope of the project. Customer and user requirements are a secondary concern. Under this model, many times we have heard customers say ‚ÄúI know that‚Äôs what I asked for but that‚Äôs not what I meant‚Äù. To which developers reply, ‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve told me that!‚Äù. This common scenario sees both customers and developers left feeling unfulfilled.', 'With higher levels of WIP and their longer release cycles it‚Äôs no wonder the client isn‚Äôt getting what they wanted. Too much development goes into making a feature which makes it difficult and expensive to change later. Now we know better.', 'With levels of WIP minimised we can now start to deliver shorter release cycles. This is a nice side effect because it helps to provide customers more visibility of the project state. Product owners can actually see working features as they evolve. Moreover, this helps product owners prioritise the features they need now as the feedback loop is far more fluid and efficient.', 'However it‚Äôs not as simple as minimising WIP. The team setup and software infrastructure need to support continual this integration of new development into the existing code base. We‚Äôve already covered our end to end team setup so we should again briefly discuss the role of automation and how it allows us to move quickly. In fact, this is one of the key components of our iterative ‚Äúrelease fast‚Äù mantra.', 'To recap, old school projects in the scope driven world tend to develop code now and integrate later. This is a poor software development practice no matter which way you look at it. As mentioned earlier, in our way of working we make heavy use of continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) tools. CI is of particular importance because it sees every incremental change committed to our main code base tested for functionality, integration and regression. This does not happen in the rush two weeks before ‚Äúgo-live‚Äù. It happens on every merge, every day. We hit problems early and we solve them quickly. Subsequently software development is done on working, well factored and tested code. Needless to say, the foundation from which new development can take place is far more solid.', 'If code is integrated, tested, well factored and client approved then what‚Äôs holding us back from releasing now. Nothing stops us - so we do it. And we do it often. In fact, because the client has been involved along the way we can start releasing and validating immediately. This incremental approach is an incredible gain over scope driven approaches.', 'This article has presented the next three aspects of the software production approach - integrating early, managing the backlog and releasing frequently. In the final part three I‚Äôll discuss the final pieces of the system - validation and measuring the success of the product by using KPIs.']",[]

The ideas presented here are based on the methods on my own experiences and those we use here at Futurice so with some luck, you come away with some ideas that you can use to develop your own approach.', 'Developing enterprise-level software is very difficult and failures are extremely expensive, so reliable ways of working that really deliver results are vitally important. Standard practices are luckily changing for the better.', 'There‚Äôs a lot to manage in an enterprise-level software development project and challenges come from a number of different aspects:', 'All easier said than done.', 'Traditionally large, complex software projects have been managed using structured methods based on analysis, design, coding and testing - in that order. Developers are typically organised in functional teams and they usually have little visibility the workings of the other teams they deal with. Integration is not continuous, Release cycles are long and iterations were slow. Needless to say, projects operating under in this way often run over budget and deliver late.', 'In the beginning of my career as a software engineer, this was the standard practice. A number of projects were delivered but it was not easy and the long feedback cycles often meant the significant mistakes were made whilst expensive redevelopment was common. Integration was a nightmare.', 'My first exposure to lean principles was in 2002 whilst I worked in the production planning department of a German research institution. Lean manufacturing was hot and its application to the software domain was often by way of a set of principles collectively called Extreme Programming. Rightly or wrongly, in my mind this was the beginning of Agile methods in a software development context. Start from the point of view of the customer and deliver those features which lead to the customer‚Äôs satisfaction. The idea of Extreme Programming (XP) was that it improved a software project in five essential ways; communication, solution simplicity, continuous feedback, respect between customer and developer, and confidence to move forward with new features and development. However it was widely misunderstood and difficult to implement in most environments.', 'In stark contrast to the traditional waterfall approaches, XP methods called for continual user feedback and iterating functionality based on that feedback. Requirement specification documents without end became a thing of the past. In fact, Extreme Programming was incorrectly associated as a methodology which called for no documentation. It does in fact call for documentation but only for documentation that adds value.', 'Although the roots of its history stretches back to the 1980s, the mainstream emergence of Scrum as a methodology in the early to mid 2000s saw it as far more palatable to the corporate environment. It‚Äôs perceived structure was stronger and it‚Äôs documentation process was clearly defined. Corporates took note and soon enough many were calling their projects Agile - something that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Although not perfect, the value of agile methods could be seen as a way to tackle the difficulties surrounding software development.', 'Over the years, we‚Äôve developed a set of ways of working which borrow heavily from lean and agile methods. Without a doubt this has been a large contributor to our track record. In this article, I will attempt to explain the management methodology that we use to run software projects. The methods are simple however it is our discipline in execution that has made it so successful. In point form, this means:', 'This is where it all starts. Here we aim to tear down the functional silos and bring people together to create interdisciplinary teams. Thus supporting co-operating in a way that produces a mutually valuable customer outcome. The important thing here is getting people collaborating to focus on value and how to maximise it in terms of the project, the business and importantly the end customers. Product owners, designers, developers, quality assurance and analysts all in one room, sitting together, building. You can probably start to imagine how this facilitates communication between the project stakeholders. Validation starts from the get go and our experience shows that if you want efficiency and the best outcomes, this is the place to start.', 'In fact, co-creation encompases a broad variety of stakeholders. Business people use co-creation to identify value whilst working in a customer centric way, engineers use it to incorporate design thinking into their agile development methods, and experienced service designers use co-creation as a way to better understand the problem worth designing for. The reason co-creation is so powerful is because it brings together diverse opinions. Diversity of opinion is what truly drives stronger outcomes because it supports a far higher level of efficiency in the end product. When opinions align, as often happens inside functional silos, inefficiency is typical and outcomes are subsequently hindered.', 'In other words, the real power of co-creation lies in the fact that it brings multiple views of the world into the analysis process. When the stakes are high it is dangerous to project one‚Äôs own understanding of what is right and wrong onto the solution at hand. No matter how smart or how widely read, one views the world through a particular frame and we look to confirm those views in the information we seek and the solutions we produce. Co-creation is the simplest way to start working around this natural human bias so we use it extensively.', 'Traditional development teams setup based on function. That is, Database administrators, front end developers, back end developers, network administrators are each organised into functional silos. Intuitively, this makes sense as it allows project members to specialise whilst project managers can optimise their teams in terms of costs. Unfortunately, this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. The most visible consequences of this are longer lead times and higher energy spent coordinating activities. Further exacerbating this is each team has very little visibility or understanding of how their outputs interact with the other aspects of the system. Waste becomes common as handoffs often lead to re-work, quality issues, bottlenecks and delays. It doesn‚Äôt take much insight to realise that all of these issues lead to increase costs - in contrast to what we are actually trying to optimise in this setup.', 'The developers who work with us vary in their experience but overall the common thread between them is that they are good at what they do. Rather than organise by function, we organise teams vertically so they are cross functional - a speed optimised setup. With this in mind, we provide our teams with clear constraints with which they can work within and it is then up to them to organise themselves within this boundary to choose the best way forward to get a project done. With that comes a lot of responsibility and trust but our experience over the past years has shown that in this setting people tend to deliver their best. We encourage teamwork and collaboration so that project members can play to their strengths. It‚Äôs a potent mix but some might consider this as a leap of faith - one we are happy to make. Give project members the room to achieve along with the resources they need and the chances are that the outcome will be exceptional.', 'In my experience, horizontally organised teams as described above (cost optimised) more often than not waste considerable time on integration between the layers. In fact, the experience is one I hope I won‚Äôt have to work in again. Vertically organised teams (speed optimised) on the other hand are rewarding work in and progress is rapid because integration happens as the software is developed. Integration almost feels like a non-issue. Can you imagine?', 'Here I‚Äôve presented the first two aspects of an approach to software production - co-creation and team setup.

In many ways‚Ä¶","['Validation', 'Measuring Success', 'Conclusion']","['After parts one and two, this is the third and final installment of this series discussing an approach to software production. In many ways, this is the part that is often misunderstood in established businesses but it is vitally important. This is the part where I discuss how we actually measure the value being created by our new system. A system that can‚Äôt deliver business value is hardly worth investing in.', 'By now, we have a solid framework from which we can start validating the fruits of our labour. We are co-creating, integrating early and releasing quickly however we still don‚Äôt know whether anyone actually needs our product. It goes without saying that products must be validated early on in the piece. That is, it is critical to seek feedback about the new product, in some form or another, from the target markets who we anticipate will use the product.', 'Many new businesses start with a comprehensive plan of what they are looking to achieve and how. Although this detailed planning provides comfort and makes project justification easier it is in large part a wasted exercise. New products are just too uncertain to make such detailed planning useful. Instead, starting from a broad project vision we use the principles explained in this article and we back them up with customer validation and adjust where necessary.', 'Although validation is no guarantee of success, it does reduce the likelihood of waste. Not only are we validating that we are on the right track, we are more importantly finding out whether we are on the wrong track. Consider how many products have been built at considerable expense in the absence of validation only to fail after launch because no one actually wanted the product. The number of projects fitting this bill is endless. Again, consider how much time, effort and money could have been saved if the product was validated early on in the development cycle. The product strategy could have been pivoted towards a new direction or even abandoned entirely. Validation is about introducing a customer focused feedback loop into the development lifecycle. Develop, validate, refine, repeat.', 'Earlier it was mentioned that we are no longer measuring deliverables against scope and schedules. This extends to the measurement of project success. You might be surprised to read that delivery of the scope is no longer a measure of success and that we do not treat the velocity of user story completion as a KPI in our development - it makes no sense. Our experience is that this is counterproductive to quality software production because it perverts the incentives for well factored, well tested code that meets or exceeds the customer‚Äôs requirements. With a focus on velocity, humans naturally tend to take shortcuts to meet deadlines. Moreover, as managers, in this mode we tend to start making estimations and promises that we can‚Äôt meet as time starts to become the focal point of the daily routine. If you deliver a project on time and within budget but the software does not do what the business had envisaged then who has the project been a success for? (hint: it‚Äôs not the customer or the end user)', 'As many software developers have painfully learnt, software development timelines are often a waste of time and estimating the time it takes to deliver a complete piece of code for a feature can be difficult. It takes practice and an acute awareness of your project domain and even then developers will tend to be well off. With this in mind we take a different approach that we reason makes far more sense in terms of considering software as an integral part of a business strategy and operations.', 'We look to measure success against KPIs which reflect the value our software delivers to the business. For example, growth in sales, increases in margin, increased conversions, etc etc. As soon as our clients can let go of the traditional mindset of scope and delivery and move onto business value delivered, project sponsors can only then start to understand the value they are receiving. By focusing on KPIs, feature creep is also minimised. Does it add value and does it increase the KPIs? If not, it may be that the requested new feature will be an overproduction which will provide a limited increase in value.', 'At Futurice we generally measure two things. Firstly we measure which features are of priority and we work on aim to deliver those first. Working closely with the product owner we are able to ensure that the things we deliver are the things the client needs now and which things the client attaches greatest importance to.', 'Secondly, we take actual business metrics to measure the success of our projects. For example, sales growth, margin expansion, conversion rates, etc. We could have the fastest project delivery ever but if we are not improving our business metrics then what are we really doing? This is how we wish to be measured. That is, measured by the business impact our work delivers. We are confident to stand by this.', 'The result of this is that we tend not to promise project delivery dates and for many organisations this will be difficult to understand. Reflect on this for a moment. We do not work to delivery dates. Instead, we work to deliver the features we can produce in the allocated time and budget.', ""There is another benefit of the KPI driven approach. A focus on priority driven deliverables focuses a client's mind on what is important whilst allowing us to start focusing on the quality of our work over the quantity of our work. This means we focus more on well factored code that is easier to test and scale. The net result of which is a sustainable working pace, higher productivity, better quality code and ultimately more meaningful software."", 'Over part one, part two and in this part three I have presented a simple and modern approach to software production that we have used to achieve outstanding results across projects. It is heavily customer driven, it is iterative and it is sustainable across both short and long running projects. Just as important, it encourages close collaboration between teams, project members and clients. In our experience this Agile way of working has been of great benefit to us and it is a large part of our success. For the readers of this article, the beauty of what has been presented here is that it is both repeatable and reproducible across a broad number of domains.']",[]

However, in its current form, the device‚Äôs potential is severely limited as it only uses one hand gesture for input and interaction. This post describes my efforts to find a workaround for this limitation, and the solution I came up with using a Leap Motion Controller.', '\nThe HoloLens', 'The single gesture supported by the HoloLens out of the box provides the capabilities roughly equivalent to a mouse with a single button. Consider that for traditional computers it is normal to use mice with 2‚Äì4 buttons and a wheel, not to mention a keyboard, and you might understand why a single-button mouse equivalent might fall a bit short by today‚Äôs standards.', 'But the issue isn‚Äôt just about limiting the device to a single gesture interaction: While the gesture itself is very simple in theory, it has proven quite difficult for first-time users to perform in practice. I personally experienced the lack of gestures first-hand (pun not intended) while playing around with the HoloLens in FutuLabs, our internal arm dedicated to the exploration of emerging technologies, and had several ideas die already at the idea phase because of this limitation.', '\nThe Leap Motion Controller in action', 'At this time we were also testing the use of a Leap Motion Controller (LMC), a specialised USB peripheral that provides very accurate hand tracking data in real time. So it occurred to me whether it would be possible to combine the LMC with the HoloLens to enable the creation of custom gestures. This whole thing also happened to play out at a period of time where I was looking for a topic for my Master‚Äôs thesis, and this seemed like the perfect thesis project. After discussing with my professor and my supervisor, I set out to build the system.', 'Several months of work later I managed to complete an initial version. The result is a system where hand tracking data is continuously streamed to the HoloLens, allowing for the implementation of custom gestures. And just recently we decided to open source the whole project, so as to hopefully open the door for other developers and researchers to explore a more wide variety of interactions in mixed reality. This post provides an insight into the workings of the developed system, the final result, and thoughts about the future.', '\nPhysical setup', 'The above picture shows the setup I used during development. The LMC is mounted on top of the HoloLens with a small angled block in-between, so that the LMC has a better view of the area where hands are generally used.', 'As can be seen, the LMC is not directly connected to the HoloLens, but rather connected to a laptop. This is because the LMC has to be physically connected with a USB cable in order to be powered and ensure a good enough transfer speed. A separate computer was needed as the HoloLens only has a single Micro-USB port that cannot be used with peripherals. The only thing I needed to do was to set up a connection between the computer and the HoloLens, to stream the sensor data generated by the LMC.', 'In the end I decided to set up two parallel connections, one for streaming data and one for control messages. The former uses UDP to keep the latency to a minimum. The risk associated with the use of UDP is that there is no guarantee that the packets will arrive in the order they are sent, or even arrive at all.', 'Fortunately, the LMC runs at a high frequency (roughly 100fps) and each message has a unique, incrementing ID, making it relatively easy to account for these risks. For the control messages I used TCP, since speed isn‚Äôt critical but successful delivery of the messages is.', 'Apart from the most basic gestures where the hand‚Äôs position and orientation aren‚Äôt taken into account, it is not enough to directly use the data provided by the LMC. All the positions and rotations given are from the LMC‚Äôs point of view, but we need to know what they are from the point of view of the HoloLens. I wanted to create a method for calibrating the two devices (i.e. determine their position and rotation in relation to each other) without needing any additional and/or special equipment (e.g. custom markers or a printed design) so that it would be easy for anyone to take the system into use. It also removes the risk of equipment failure or forgetting to bring it along at the most inopportune moment.', '\nThe Perspective-n-Point problem. Source: opencv.org', 'The starting point for determining the relationship between the two devices was to find some common features that both of them are able to recognise. Because of the specialised nature of the LMC, it made sense to choose some part of the hands. Going through the data provided by the LMC, one feature in particular stood out: the fingertips.', 'On the side of the HoloLens, the only sensor directly accessible to developers is the camera mounted on the front of the device. Fortunately, plenty of research exists on how to find fingertips in images.', 'This combination of data ‚Äì 3D points from the LMC and 2D points in an image from the HoloLens ‚Äì lines up perfectly with a well known problem in computer vision and augmented reality known as the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem. In short, if you take a picture of some 3D points and are able to determine which 2D point in the image corresponds to which 3D point, then you are able to determine the position and rotation of the camera.', '\nExample of image used for calibration', 'The calibration process I ended up with in the end goes as follows. You begin by taking one or more images of your outstretched hands as shown in the above image. The more images you take, the better the calibration result (should) be, but it is more tedious to do. The only requirement here is that the hands need to be held in the shown position. This allows the system to later determine which fingertip in the image belongs to which finger and pair up that point with the correct fingertip from the LMC. At the same moment as the image is taken, the 3D data from the LMC is also saved for later use.', '\nLeft: A hand detected from an image. Right: The fingertips and center of mass detected', 'The images are all sent to the computer which the LMC is connected to. In principle, processing could also be done on the HoloLens, but since I already had to use a separate computer for the LMC, I decided I might as well make use of it.', 'Once all the images have been sent, I have to find the hands in the images before I can find the fingertips. This proved to be the technically most difficult task, and it required me to develop my own system for detecting skin based on colour, combining research from several different papers. Once the hands have been found, fingertips are then located using the process in the work of Prasertsakul and Kondo (2014)"").', 'With all the pieces together, all that remains is to actually solve PnP. Fortunately, this is such a well known problem with so many ways of solving it that OpenCV, an open source computer vision library, contains a function for it. The result of running the function is the transformation needed for moving the LMC data to the point of view of the HoloLens. The transformation is then sent to the HoloLens where it is used to transform all data received from the LMC.', '\nResults of calibration, captured through Microsoft‚Äôs Mixed Reality Capture', 'The above image shows the results of running the calibration, with the red spheres showing the positions of the fingertips after applying the calculated transformation to the LMC data. As can be seen, the results are decent but not perfect. They are also very consistent.', 'It is difficult to pinpoint what the exact source of error is, though a couple of possibilities are that the physical and virtual (the one used for determining where to draw objects) cameras of the HoloLens are not perfectly aligned, or that the points identified as fingertips are not the exact same points the LMC considers to be the fingertips. But the accuracy and consistency together should be enough to enable the development of custom gestures.', 'There are two things I would primarily like to improve, the first one being the way the LMC is mounted. A better mount that attaches to the HoloLens would make it possible to place the LMC in almost exactly the same position each time, which in turn would make it possible to reuse calibration results even if the LMC is removed and reattached between uses.', 'The second development area is hand detection. Colour based detection is too unreliable. There are simply too many skin-like colours commonly found in most backgrounds to reliably only extract the hands. Looking at the current research, a neural network based approach seems to be the most promising general purpose solution.', 'By open sourcing this project I really hope it enables others to look deeper into how we could interact in an environment where the real and virtual are truly mixed together. When talking about devices such as the HoloLens, the first deficiency most people want to point out is the technological one.', 'It is certainly true that the hardware still has a ways go, e.g. in terms of improving the field of view and processing power, but I feel most people overestimate our current understanding of how to design for this new environment. It is in no way obvious that the lessons learned in a traditional 2D context will translate to a mixed reality one. On the other direction, you cannot rely on taking cues from physical design either, since the objects you interact with are still only virtual.', 'It is not even known whether gestures are the best option in the first place. When developing, you will notice quite quickly how tired your arms can get when you have a lot of interactions. With so many open questions, I hope this system can contribute one piece of the puzzle, so we can answer these questions in time.']",[]

Meanwhile, a data scientist has to be much more comfortable with uncertainty and variability. After all, machine learning is all about mining statistical patterns from data. Because of the inherently statistical nature of machine learning, it is more flexible on complex problems, but also more difficult to interpret and debug.', 'Developing a machine learning application is even more iterative and explorative process than software engineering. Machine learning is applied on problems that are too complicated for humans to figure out (that is why we ask a computer to find a solution for us!). Therefore, a data scientist has to embrace experimental attitude and be prepared to test a few approaches before settling on a satisfying one.', 'From the outside, the modes of work looks very similar: both species of professionals spend a lot of time hunched over a laptop. Data scientists spend a lot of their time writing code in Python or other general-purpose programming language just like traditional programmers. The majority of time in a machine learning project is consumed by tasks that are best carried out by traditional programming: writing scripts for merging, cleaning up and visualizing data, and integrating the machine learning subsystem with the rest of the application. Certainly the toolkits do have their differences, too. Data scientists are familiar with linear regression and other statistical algorithms while traditional programmers known REST APIs and web frameworks inside out.', 'When does a product benefit from machine learning? Will there be any use for traditional software engineering in the future or will machine learning consume all of software development?', ""No, machine learning will not displace traditional software engineering. Most types of problems that are solved with software engineering today, will be carried out by traditional programming also in the future. Machine learning, on the other hand, provides a way to tackle new kinds of problems, the kinds that have been unfeasible to solve previously. Tasks that humans perform with relative ease but that can't be formulated as exact rules (detecting objects in images, driving a car, etc.) are prime candidates for machine learning solutions. Machine learning might be the correct solution also if a software has to adapt to regular changes in its environment."", 'There are some limitations, however. Learning rules from data requires that you have a large data set of typical cases available. Furthermore, the data must be tagged with the desired outcome. Sometimes suitable data is being generated as a side effect of some existing business process or is published as open data. If not, collecting and labeling data can require considerable effort which might be expensive.', 'In this article, I have contrasted machine learning and traditional programming to better highlight their characteristics. This may make the distinction appear starker than it really is. It is rather a continuum of how much the application functionality is affected by data in contrast to explicit decisions by a programmer.', ""Let's imagine building a search engine for Wikipedia. In the rigid programming extreme, a search engine might simply return all\xa0documents which contain the search terms exactly. Not all terms are equally descriptive, however. Terms that occur frequently in a cluster of\xa0documents, but are quite rare overall, are distinctive and should\xa0have greater influence on the ranking of the documents. In this case the functionality of the search engine depends partly on the data, namely the term frequencies. Another step towards\xa0better utilization of data\xa0would be the PageRank algorithm which identifies important pages by analyzing the network of links between the pages. Google resides even further on the machine learning end of the spectrum. It uses a mix of signals to try to capture the semantic content of the search terms and aims to provides meaningful answers, not just matching search terms."", 'There is also another way how machine learning and traditional programming will approach each other. I believe that in the future it gets easier to experiment with intelligent features, such as recommendations\xa0or machine translation. More and more machine learning solutions will be published as handy services and reusable components.', 'Machine learning complements traditional programming by mining rules from data. It is useful in complicated cases where writing the rules by hand is unfeasible. Traditional programming and machine learning have their distinctions but also share a close kinship.']",[]

However, very few accounts discuss the anxiety that the characteristics and features of an autonomous organization can cause employees. When successful, an autonomous organization is a motivating place to work, and one that helps foster the employees‚Äô mental capabilities. However, it can also appear very different from what was originally intended. The challenges of an autonomous organization can become particularly apparent to someone joining the organization as a new employee or who lacks confidence brought on by years of experience. Individuals‚Äô varying needs for support and guidance must be carefully taken into account to prevent the strengths of an autonomous organization from turning against itself.', ""One of the cornerstones of an autonomous organization is a clearly stated vision that outlines the organization‚Äôs future direction, which also serves as the starting point for prioritizing one's own actions. It is essential that the entire organization moves in the same direction, even if speed and style is up to personal preference. However, when the actual key performance indicators or KPIs are not clearly defined, chasing the vision can easily lead to feelings of inadequacy and inferiority. If an employee‚Äôs success criteria are tied only to the organization's high-level vision, they will never get the calming feeling of having succeeded. When expectations are not clearly defined, feelings of inadequacy and constant pressure keep accumulating."", 'The responsibility of autonomous decision-making tends to increase pressure and uncertainty. It is vital for autonomous organizations that decisions are made together, and in order to ensure the ability to react quickly and flexibly, decision-making power must lie wherever the need for change is identified. The ability to make decisions requires an efficient flow of information within the organization. However, there will always be more information than one can absorb. It is already challenging enough to keep up with the internal flood of information of an organization alone. Separating relevant information is challenging, and new employees in particular may find it difficult to determine when they know enough to make an informed decision.', ""In addition to having the necessary information, decision-making requires an understanding of the big picture and its underlying causes and effects. Acquiring the big picture in an autonomous organization is complicated due to the fact that their organizational structures are often not clear and written. It can be very difficult to assess the impact of your decision on the entire organization. In a more traditional organization you know exactly who influences what, and which role each employee is supposed to play. In an autonomous organization the roles are blurrier and in constant motion. Due to the lack of a formal hierarchy, most interdependencies between employees are tacit knowledge that is slowly absorbed through everyday work. When a low hierarchy autonomous organization does not clearly provide an employee with their own areas of responsibility, getting to know the organization's ways of working takes time."", 'If an individual starts to feel insecure, they will often blame themselves. The thought, ""I guess I‚Äôm not self-organizing enough, because I feel insecure and anxious"", starts to run through their head. This makes the person feel particularly bad, as autonomous organizations have a reputation of supporting happiness, enthusiasm and drive. Thinking , ‚Äúthere must be something wrong with me, because I am not faring well in this organisation‚Äù, amplifies their already existing feelings of inadequacy.', ""It is important to note that these uncertainties and anxieties are not caused by a person's mismatch with the role or the organization. These individual experiences simply reflect the organization‚Äôs practices and ways of working that are in particular need of improvement. A psychological safety net is especially important in an autonomous organization, as it enables and encourages employees with such uncertainties and needs to be bring them up without the fear of seeming incompetent."", 'In order to function, self-organizing requires strong supporting structures. These structures must be tailored to the needs of each employee.

They help the company improve efficiency and sustain the existing business, for instance, but given the current digitalization in all industries, incremental innovations may no longer be enough. As new competitors with lower cost structures and no legacy systems or legacy people enter the market and radical new business models are introduced, simply doing the same old thing slightly better may not be sufficient. A complete rethinking of the business foundations might be required to stay in the game. For incumbents, that means introducing breakthrough innovations.', 'But why is radical innovation so difficult for large corporations? There are several reasons:', 'A huge volume of business books have been written on innovation in large firms (see, for instance, here and various methodologies have been developed, too. While these might be a good and necessary read for many leaders, we think that unleashing innovation requires much more than a new fancy methodology, a few hackathons here and there, and putting aside some dollars for experimentation in the corporate budget.', 'In our opinion, it all starts with organizing the company for radical innovation. We believe that radical innovation must come from outside, not within. Business leaders should realize that the legacy organization can only do so much to support innovation and renewal. The legacy business and existing organization should be in good enough shape - it should protect and improve the core and keep it competitive. Further, the legacy business should be responsible for incremental innovations that take the existing core business to a new level. But that‚Äôs more or less it.', 'Find out about innovation services', 'If corporations wish to unleash radical innovation they must cut it loose from the mothership. It is essential that the truly radical innovation activity is separated from the core business into another entity that works under different rules, structures, incentives, metrics and culture. All the new crazy stuff needs to be created outside the core, in a separate innovation environment (or lab, or hub, whatever you call it). In that environment, the culture needs to favor openness, transparency, freedom, long-term focus, experimentation, creativity, cross-fertilization of knowledge as well as responsibility for the end results. In that environment, radically new ideas often come from outside and are commonly created in cooperation with customers, partners, vendors, universities and startups.', 'This all means innovation on the edge, not in the core, by putting strange innovative people together to think of crazy stuff without any boundaries. Once new, radical products have been created, corporations need to allow them to fly, provide adequate support in terms of money and talent, and accept the fact that some of the new radical innovations might eventually cannibalize the core - or in some cases fail.', 'The world is dramatically changing due to digitalization, so if corporations wish to radically renew their business, they need to engage dual transformation:', 'It is all about reckoning this duality in innovation, and making the necessary changes in the organization model to nurture this de-coupling. Only then can various innovation methodologies, processes and tools be useful.', 'From business leaders, this dual transformation requires above all courage and persistence. A transformation like this might be complicated, slow and painful, and cutting radical innovation loose might prove hard to implement in practice. The inertia of the legacy business may make de-coupling of incremental and radical innovation very difficult. The legacy business and organization will always favor its own interests, and remind the leaders that they make the biggest business impact (which is, of course, true in the short term). In their opinion, all the radically new stuff typically is ‚Äúnice, small things, but they will never truly move the needle on the corporate level‚Äù.', 'Simply looking at the numbers, wouldn‚Äôt it be safer to invest in the incremental renewal of the core business and leave radically new things out of the equation, since they entail so much risk, pain and uncertainty?', 'But the answer to that question is exactly the reason why courageous leadership is needed for corporations to thoroughly renew their business.

My two weeks at Futurice included a lot of meetings & new people, a small culture shock and huge amount of learning.', 'When I first arrived at Futurice‚Äôs Helsinki office, I was met by an electronic reception that sent a message to the person I was looking for. The entrance lobby is actually a cafeteria where employees are baristas of their own lives. The lobby was filled with colorful furniture, sticky notes, sweaters and jeans. It was clear that this was not a traditional corporation with hierarchical structures.', 'Futurice‚Äôs working culture is almost famous, partly because it has been chosen twice in a row as the best European workplace. Trust, transparency and caring are the keywords every slideshow represents proudly. But how do these values manifest in everyday life? I learned that employees are given company credit cards and trusted to use them with good judgement. In the spirit of transparency, people can check out each others salaries and caring is expressed in many ways ‚Äì for example there is a free breakfast served every Friday.', 'What can we learn from all this? Lean structure and freedom of doing seem to propel the company‚Äôs growth at a pace of almost 30 % per year.

Clients apparently appreciate Futurice‚Äôs user-centric and engaging way of working. Today Futurice even competes with more traditional consultancies like McKinsey.', 'For a social psychologist, examining how employees navigate in environment that demands self-organizing, networking and trustworthy was interesting. Most employees seem to enjoy this kind of work context, but it does make me wonder: what is the meaning of structures, and the security they bring to the employees?', 'In two weeks, I also became familiar with Lean Service Creation, Futurice‚Äôs service design toolkit and methodology.

I was able to use this toolkit to coach students from Haaga-Helia‚Äôs designing services course and startup teams at the KIUAS Team-Up startup competition. In service design the focus is on people or in user-friendly ways of doing and we, as social psychologists, have the best expertise when it comes to behavior in some specific context.

No need to see a doctor.', 'To say that this kind of behavior happens would be a massive understatement. But can a doctor even know when their patients take their medicine?\xa0Do the people running clinical trials on new, possibly dangerous drugs, know how their patients actually use the medication given to them?

Everybody needs to talk about these things, and in the 2000s, what better place to talk about it than an anonymous internet forum. Luckily, we have 16 years worth of anonymous discussion data from\xa0Finnish internet forum Suomi24 and Aller (owner of Suomi24) has graciously offered their data for research.

The goal of this study was to gain a deeper\xa0understanding of what actually happens after the visit to the doctors ‚Äì the whole journey, if you will.', 'We had many research questions and one of the first we tackled was: which drugs are most discussed about? To answer this, the first step is being able to detect when people are talking about a specific drug. Surprisingly, this is not trivial, as the Finnish language lets one talk about the same thing in a variety of inflected forms. To give an example, one might say ‚Äútykk√§√§n vet√§√§ burnaa‚Äù or ‚Äúburanasta tuli paha olo‚Äù. In both cases, the writer is referring to the drug ‚Äúburana‚Äù, but the word is different.

Therefore, we wanted to produce our drug list directly from the discussion data. However, it‚Äôs not practical to go about reading posts and picking out any words that one might see.', 'Here‚Äôs where the fancy new machine learning stuff comes in.

On the other hand, words that don't have much to do with each other get vectors that aren't very similar, such as those for House\xa0and Zyrtec. Obviously, we can't represent\xa0many words and the relationships between them by drawing them on a two-dimensional image like this.

Since this is a common theme on Suomi24, the neural network should assign similar vectors to these words. Using this knowledge, we came up with a semi-automated tool to reliably collect lists of drugs ‚Äì or any related words really. One inputs a starting word, and the tool starts suggesting words with similar vectors. The user can then accept a word or reject it. Accepted words are also used as new ‚Äúseeds‚Äù for further searches.', 'With this tool we collected a list of over 1300 different drug words, which include slang words that could never be found using premade lists given by drug companies or health authorities.

However should you accept this black box as a given?"", 'At Futurice there is a long history of internal development to create tools and procedures to let our employees focus on their work. This means making hour markings less painful, tracking inventory (eg. phones, laptops, gadgets, books), integration with 3rd party services to avoid manual duplication of HR information, and in general creating tools for problems worth solving.', 'Since 2015, we‚Äôve been containerizing our existing internal applications to be cloud-ready. The plan has been to replace our own hosted hardware in a local data center, bring forth a better developer experience, and ease the maintenance burden for our IT staff.

Red Hat's System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) serves as the SSH key lookup for our employee database (LDAP) needed for authentication. Docker Flow Proxy listens to the Docker API to keep a tally of running services and handles service discovery in the form of routing service domains to their respective swarm service node ports.

But more necessary than ever.', 'That said, given the ongoing disconnect between what financial services brands say about themselves and customers‚Äô day-to-day experiences of banks, are we sure that the prevailing approach to customer experience ‚Äì with its emphasis on data, marketing, channel strategy, technology and analytics - is the right one?', 'Does CX in your organisation get left to the data guys? Maybe it‚Äôs viewed as a customer service issue and measured through customer surveys? Alternatively, does it get handed to the tech people to develop a tech solution?', 'Lots of progress is being made across different organisations - we‚Äôve seen NPS uplift of 20-40%, lifetime value increasing, better ‚Äòengagement‚Äô. But, the general approach feels like it‚Äôs getting a little ‚Äúcookie-cutter.‚Äù', 'It‚Äôs all about NPS plus better CRM plus personalised, targeted marketing. Great, but I think this approach to customer experience fundamentally misses the point. Customer experience isn‚Äôt the responsibility of data or marketing, it‚Äôs a cross-silo objective, a cultural phenomenon. Ultimately, it‚Äôs a human thing, with all the chaos and unpredictability that this implies.', 'Customer experience is all about helping people engage better with their world. Money is an important part of our world and financial services CX therefore has a vital mission to help consumers engage with money.', 'So, what might an alternative manifesto for outstanding CX look like? I have come up with five principles that could help inform a radically different approach to CX, and I‚Äôm looking forward to building on these at events and via debate over the coming months', 'From exposure to 4,000 -10,000 ad messages a day, to checking our phones 1500 times a week, we consumers have ever increasing claims on our time. Outstanding financial services CX should avoid adding to the noise and aim to be attention saving rather than attention claiming, a phrase I‚Äôm borrowing from Trendwatchers. A key focus needs to be on finding ways to quietly solve consumers‚Äô pain points or problems in the background, whether it‚Äôs savings app Digit working out how much consumers can afford to save each day then automatically transferring that amount into their savings account, or Czech bank brand Air Bank piloting a NFC-enabled contactless cash withdrawal system allowing consumers to withdraw cash from ATMs without inserting their cards.', 'There‚Äôs a lot that Financial Services can learn from other sectors about finding and remembering the human and effortlessly removing their pain points. Futurice recently partnered with Finnair, airport services provider Finavia, to design a prototype for the world‚Äôs first face recognition check-in desk system at Helsinki Airport. The trial, carried out earlier this year, aimed to explore how to reduce the pain points involved in producing ID at airport check-in desks, by allowing one thousand Finnair frequent flyers to upload their photo via a dedicated test app before arriving at the airport. When arriving for their flights, the customers used a designated check-in desk where face recognition technology meant check-in staff could recognise and greet them by name, without the need to produce any documents.', 'Could a similar system be used to verify customers‚Äô ID in bank branches, thus removing a small pain point from the process? These interventions soon add up and become real ways to save people‚Äôs attention.', 'And let‚Äôs not forget the ‚Äòremember‚Äô part of this principle - when we translate insights about customers into technology, we need to retain the vision and not just commission another bunch of IT platforms.', 'Until now, the narrative around Fintech start-ups has tended to portray them as the big disruptors of established financial services brands. What would happen if, instead, the financial services sector viewed them as Space Probes, helping us find where the real customers‚Äô pain points and the jobs to be done really are? Fintechs are usually solving interesting consumer problems. Take student debt, which is a growing issue facing workforces globally. In the US, CommonBond has taken a fresh approach to the problem of student debt by providing a platform that enables employers to refinance the loans of high calibre grads they want to hire. Meanwhile US peer-to-peer loan service Lending Club removes the fear around applying for credit, by allowing consumers to check the interest rate they could get for a loan, without impacting their credit score.', 'Ongoing, constructive dialogue and partnership with as many interesting companies and Fintechs as possible - that sounds like a good recipe for spotting great improvements in CX in financial services. It also builds on the ‚Äòfind the human‚Äô point earlier.', 'It‚Äôs easy to be seduced by beautifully designed customer experiences and apps. However, as companies like Uber are painfully discovering, customer experience needs to be sustainable. This means remembering that customers, employees and ethics intersect and that delivering a great customer experience must not come at the expense of a great employee experience. We are all in this together and the brands that deliver best in class customer experiences must be similarly ambitious when it comes to ensuring and delivering a great employee experience. Customer experience isn‚Äôt purely a customer facing mission - people are our greatest assets, here to deliver it in the first place.', '![](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/5UxUIk16bmgU8u6WwaiQG0/8ab6f9a27341a6b63ecfa5db404d3c69/intersecting-circles_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png)', 'Delivering great customer experience is a cultural phenomenon that cuts across siloes and hierarchies. It‚Äôs hard to imagine a great customer experience emerging from companies where employees work in cubicles or where sticking things on the walls is banned, or where some people haven‚Äôt even been to the other floors in their building. The mindset and methods required to deliver stand out customer experience include co-creation, experimentation and permission to fail. It‚Äôs hard to understate the importance of this cultural element. Each initiative to improve CX needs to be accompanied by organisational evolution - taking our own people on their journey, not leaving it to suppliers. Ensuring we‚Äôre making our very organisations future capable with a new set of values and practices.', 'At Futurice, we focus a large amount on what we call ‚Äòlean service creation‚Äô - a mindset of collaborative problem solving using a series of canvases. It‚Äôs not the canvas itself that counts; it‚Äôs more the ability to bring people together to align and collectively move forward', '![](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/3lrkLUmH4Qkw6meMEo8gw2/d3969bca354fef7058d5d8338c4f9341/lsc-pic_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png)', 'Rather than metrics which are geared to linear process and hierarchy, delivering great CX should focus on playbooks: a blend of business process workflows, standard operating procedures and cultural values. These offer a much more flexible way of managing and evaluating the messy and human nature of CX. One characteristic of successful playbooks is a tendency to invert the traditional hierarchical approach to decision making and empower people on the front line to make decisions. The rationale for this ‚Äúinverted pyramid‚Äù approach is that front line employees are usually closest to the action and have the necessary information to make the right ‚Äúfront line‚Äù decision. Companies with great CX playbooks include Spotify with its ‚Äúlimited blast radius‚Äù approach to innovation which empowers teams to experiment and fail but deploys a decoupled architecture to lower the cost and impact of failure.', 'Meanwhile at Zappos, which is famed for outstanding customer service, customer service reps are trusted to make decisions on how to handle calls - they don‚Äôt follow a set script or refer complex decisions higher up. At my company, Futurice, everyone has the power to make good, transparent and fair decisions. To help support that, our 3 x 2 philosophy (now 4x2) provides a framework for empowering decision-making at all levels in the company.

Most design methods, thinking tools, design problems and questions of usability, functionality and aesthetics are similar in sound design to other fields of design. However, it‚Äôs very difficult, if not impossible, to look at sound in a specific point of time. It only exists in a function of time. If you wonder what sound actually is 'Everything You Should Know About Sound' by Tim Urban provides an exceptionally good answer."", ""This post is about sound design for notifications. How do you design those? Let's start by thinking how to do sound design in general.\xa0Usually sound has a supportive role, it adds something to other design aspects of a product or a service. It boosts and supports the experience, and ideally, it supports the brand as well. Being as intangible as it is, the key to successful sound design is to interview stakeholders and users beforehand in order to get an idea of the desired qualities of the sound and functions the sound should serve. And then, more importantly, you should ask for feedback once the sound is out and loud (or quiet, depending on the use case)."", 'In the digital era many sonic signals of physical origin have been replaced by electronic ones: the sounds of telephone, doorbells, school bells, cash register machines, etc. It means that we are no longer tied to the physical properties of the product. So the possibilities for sound design are greater than before.', 'Sounds in a digital service or product can be functional, confirming, provide added value or be there just for fun. In terms of their role, sounds could be divided into ""functional vs. aesthetic"" or ""informative vs. atmospheric‚Äù. Roughly, functional and informative sounds serve certain purpose, aesthetic and atmospheric sounds convey feelings. But the distinction is not very clear.', '![Image of different roles sound can play in a service](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/P3X6jpKkec6KKegM2eQwS/9320810c04581dc37cd7c64e82d3c4a0/role_of_a_sound_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png)\nSounds can be functional, confirming, provide added value or be there just for fun or to generate a certain feeling.', 'Sounds feed a sense ‚Äì hearing ‚Äì that is sometimes disregarded when developing digital products and services.

One example of this are mobile phones and their apps.', '""Genius work appears, when it‚Äôs perfectly suited to its context"" (David Byrne in \'How Music Works\')', ""Genius sound design appears when it's perfectly suited to its context: users, passive listeners, technology, etc.\xa0With emerging technologies we\xa0are designing sounds for new devices, situations or even environments. If the context is new, we don‚Äôt necessarily know what really works. What is the right sound for each place? When we do know, genius sound design will appear."", 'Mobile phone is the user‚Äôs true personal computer. It contains a lot of personal data, personal settings, and it is used for communication as well as for accessing all kinds of digital services. I like to think that mobile phones and their apps, in comparison with websites, can and should contain sounds. It may be far more effective to deliver a message through sound than doing it just visually.', 'There are many activities that take place in the background in a mobile phone. Sometimes the user of a mobile phone is in a so called eyes-busy situation. Then, many interaction confirmations and notifications can still be communicated effectively and more subtly using appropriate sounds. Thanks to ringtones and text message sounds we‚Äôve got used to the idea that a mobile phone notifies us with sounds.', 'There‚Äôs one ‚Äúeasy‚Äù sound design case for mobile phones: notification sounds. The purpose of a notification is to notify the user of an event that the user is subscribed to. However, notifications are not a sound design challenge. They should always be designed as part of the whole service and part of service‚Äôs interaction design. Designers should design notifications responsibly: it should be possible to define which notifications the user wants to receive, and whether it should be an intrusive notification with a sound or not. It‚Äôs always good to ask if the notification really is so important that it needs to be delivered with a sound.', 'If your app sends notifications every hour, don‚Äôt add sounds by default. If your app sends a notification once a day, it might be useful to provide a sound for the notification. If your app has a genius algorithm that provides tailored information for the user right at the correct moment, better make sure that the notification has a sound, and preferably a distinctive one. Of course, users should always be able to choose themselves which notification to receive and decide whether it has sound on or off.', 'Mobile phone notifications are clumsy, a bit like car honking: your phone beeps trying to tell you something, but it cannot really say anything accurately. Good news is that at least it‚Äôs possible to design custom notification sounds. In that case it‚Äôs possible to distinguish where the notification comes from by the way the phone is beeping . However, while it would be beneficial to have an easily distinguishable notification sound, not many apps have that. They just use the default one.', 'A custom notification sound can be helpful for the user in many situations. Are you on holiday trip and renting a house via Airbnb? Probably the messages sent via Airbnb‚Äôs messaging are more important than other messages. It‚Äôs good to be able to distinguish between those messages just through the sound. Is your flight delayed and airline app notifies you? It would probably be good to distinguish the message from other notifications.', 'Furthermore, sounds are beneficial for the service provider as well: custom notification sounds carry the brand with them. The soundscape of a notification should go together with other sounds of the service. Or even more, sounds of an app should be in line with the brand. Sound is a vital part of the brand.', 'Furthermore, a notification sound may deliver information. It could for example tell something about size, material, condition, function or movement. But how do you represent those aspects in sound? Sound is a fairly new design subject ‚Äì we don‚Äôt have many preconceptions on how to represent different qualities in sound. But it would be highly interesting to try it out.', 'Information can be delivered on a more abstract level, too. Think about this example. You‚Äôve used a service with home delivery. It has three stages: 1) order received, 2) order is being prepared, and 3) order being delivered. When each stage begins, you receive a notification. Each of them could be similar but distinguishable from each other. For example, each notification starts with the same note. In the second stage the first note would still be there, but followed by a second note, making a simple chord. In the third stage the notification sound would be a complete tritone. This would make it possible for the user to follow the progress of the order just by hearing the notification.', ""What exactly should a notification sound like? Well, it can take many forms. Perceptual properties of the sound (nice vs. unpleasant) can't be measured directly from/by the sound itself. Instead, research or surveys on the listeners‚Äô experiences is what should be done."", 'The physical properties of sound are pitch (high/low), amplitude (or volume: silent/loud), duration (length), timbre (the spectrum or texture or colour of the sound), and\xa0envelope (the change of loudness over time). Elements of music are rhythm (how the sounds are divided on a timeline), melody (the sequence of notes over time) and harmony (the stack of musical notes at a specific point of time). All these aspects of sounds and music can be used when designing sounds.', 'What sounds good then? It‚Äôs highly subjective to the listener but often traditional instruments and harmonic components are regarded nice. For example, natural sound sources like marimba (which has wooden bars as sound source) might sound more pleasant than a metallic sound, which might have disturbing elements to some listeners‚Äô ears. It‚Äôs also good to remember that music is perceived differently in different cultures and in other parts of the world.', 'Usually a simple tone or chord with personal timbre works for a basic notification sound. If it needs to be something else, then it‚Äôs a good idea to learn more about the users and their personal preferences.', 'One technical detail to keep in mind is that a notification sound will usually be played over the small speakers of a mobile phone. This means that the bass frequencies in the sound are prone to produce unwanted distortion when the sound is played. At the same time it‚Äôs good to keep in mind that sometimes the phone is attached to a good sound system. While concentrating on the user experience through the small speakers, it would be a good to test them on a good set of speakers as well.', 'How to make sure the notification sound is audible? That‚Äôs a matter of testing, but usually synthetic sounds are heard louder than natural sounds. I‚Äôve learned that a good approach is to have a musically pleasing base for the notification and then add a distinctive sound with sharp attack on top, like in the following example. If the user misses the musical part, it‚Äôs still possible that the click sound is audible from a purse or a pocket and draws the user‚Äôs attention anyway.', ""Another thing that I‚Äôve learned from past projects is that a notification may appear out of the blue ‚Äì and even scare the user. Usually that‚Äôs not good. Adding some kind of cue sound that subtly wakes up a person's attention at the beginning is what a sound designer might want to do. Or a simple high pitched note, a similar sound to what Whatsapp has as its default notification sound, usually won‚Äôt scare too much."", 'Here‚Äôs a list of things that should be checked out with the customer when creating custom notification sounds:', '- What is the function of the notification? Should it really be delivered with a sound?\n- Should the sound be musical?\n- Does the customer have a brand sound already, as the sound always carries the brand with it?\n- Should the sound be as audible as possible, or should a subtle sound be preferred?\n- Would there be a message that the sound could potentially deliver?', 'After getting an answer\xa0to all the\xa0questions above you have a pretty good starting point to design the notification.', 'Of course, a notification sound doesn‚Äôt always need to be tailor-made. It can be simple or straight from a sound library. A good place to find inspiration or chance for even final sounds is Freesound.org. Freesound is a collaborative database of Creative Commons Licensed\xa0sounds.

Such predictions can be further broken down into two classes, depending on the type of quantity to be predicted.', 'The first class is\xa0regression, where the goal is to predict a number.', ""Demand forecasting for supermarkets is one example: given a product, how much should I order for my next stock delivery? Store owners want to make sure there's enough product on the shelves to satisfy demand, while avoiding overstock taking up expensive space in warehouses. It's especially important not to order too much of perishable goods that will have to be thrown out if not sold in time. Machine learning models to make these predictions take into account past sales, similarity between products, demographics of each store's customers, and many other factors."", ""The stock market is another example: what's the optimal price to buy or sell a given share? Human traders are increasingly supported - or even replaced - by algorithmic systems that re-estimate prices and make transactions\xa0hundreds of times per second. Such systems buying and selling from each other account for an unnerving share of the world economy. Their pricing models bring in historical trends, real-time transaction data, tips from human advisors, and even sentiment analysis scraped from social media."", 'The other class of\xa0problem is\xa0classification, where the prediction is one of a finite set of options.', 'This might be a binary yes/no choice, or a selection from a bigger set of options, depending on the exact application. Think about face recognition: Snapchat might be interested in whether or not a face is in an image, so they can decide to apply filters; while Facebook might be more interested in whose\xa0specific\xa0face is in the image, so they can make tag suggestions. Futurice have employed face recognition at Helsinki Airport as a prototype for a hands-in-pocket travel experience.', 'Classification is also important in the medical domain. Image recognition techniques can process thousands of past scan results to learn the characteristic patterns of many diseases, resulting in diagnostic accuracy that is approaching and in some cases exceeding that of human doctors. Other algorithms can blend diverse data about symptoms, test results, and live vital readings to make accurate diagnoses. In bio-medical research, huge datasets on gene expressions and chemical signatures allow new links between diseases, genetics, and treatments to be discovered.', ""The second major category of machine learning application is content recommendation. Lots of businesses have content of some kind. This might\xa0be traditional media - written articles, videos, and so on - or products sold in a store. Google's main content and source of revenue is ads. Whatever the format of the content, not all items will appeal to all people equally, so companies have a vested interest in personalising the content shown to each user. As a machine learning task, this amounts to predicting how much a given person will like each piece of content, so that recommendations can be made."", 'One major strategy is\xa0content-based recommendation, which is exactly what it sounds like: suggesting items similar to content a user has already liked. This can be as simple as recommending articles by the same authors or videos from the same channels users have looked at before. Alternatively, it could involve analysis of the text in an article to extract\xa0the main topics, then recommending other articles on the same topics.', ""There are a couple of problems with this approach. First, it's not always easy, or even possible, to define similarity between items. This is especially true for companies with diverse offerings, like Amazon. How similar is a vacuum cleaner to the latest PS4 game? Secondly, there's the problem of what to recommend for new customers who haven't consumed any content yet. We don't know their tastes, so we can't recommend similar items."", 'These problems motivate a second approach, called\xa0collaborative filtering. The idea here is to recommend items other users have liked. When a user is new, you can just recommend the most popular items across all users. As they consume content, you can personalise the recommendations based on the habits of similar users.', ""This is how Spotify's Discover Weekly works: first, your listening history\xa0and created playlists are\xa0analysed to create a profile. Then, Spotify finds other users who have similar habits to you, and creates a playlist from songs that those users have listened to, but you haven't heard yet."", ""Netflix is another well-known\xa0user\xa0of collaborative filtering. Giving customers a steady stream of fresh\xa0content tailored to their tastes is an important part of keeping them as subscribers. Famously, in 2007 they announced the Netflix Prize, a competition offering $1,000,000 to anyone who created a recommendation algorithm that was at least 10% more accurate than Netflix's own. Teams of researchers competed for 2 years before one group broke the 10% barrier and won the money. Interestingly, Netflix never used the winning solution in production, partly because of engineering restrictions and partly due to a business model shift from DVD mail order to streaming."", ""The last big category of use cases is a bit different. In regression, classification, and recommendation, we were trying to predict some output\xa0for a given situation. What if we don't have something specific to predict? What if we just have lots of data about past situations, and want to know what's interesting about it?"", 'This is the problem of\xa0unsupervised learning. This is\xa0a much harder problem than the others, because there\'s no ""truth"" to compare against. The results are\xa0generally subject to human interpretation.', 'Unsupervised approaches allow you to answer different kinds of questions, like: What kind of groups exist in the data? Is some part of the data unusual compared to the rest? What are the recurring patterns in the data? The answers to such questions can be useful on their own, or they can be used as a preprocessing step before applying supervised learning techniques.', 'User segmentation is one of the most common applications of unsupervised methods. Consider a company who operate a mobile game, and maintain an extensive log of the actions players take in the game. By analysing these logs, the company can identify groups who act similarly. Maybe one group logs in regularly, and spends money on the in-game store. Another logs in every other week, and plays for a few minutes without spending money. These groups can form the basis for further analysis: the company\xa0might look for the kind of levels the first group plays the most, so they can create similar content and keep them engaged; or they might target offers to increase the playtime of the second group and convert them to paying customers.', ""Financial institutions make heavy use of unsupervised techniques to combat fraud. When processing credit card transactions, they are on the lookout for purchases that don't seem to fit established patterns. It can be hard to get good data on which transactions are truly fraudulent, but by considering user history, unusual items can be flagged. Systems might consider factors like time since the last transaction, number of transactions in the recent past, difference from the average transaction amount, and physical location of the vendor compared to historical purchases in order to assign a novelty score to each transaction.\xa0When the score is high, purchases might be automatically declined or flagged for manual review."", ""Some companies are starting to use supervised and unsupervised techniques together. Google News\xa0is a great example. The site aggregates stories from many media outlets, and unsupervised learning automatically groups different versions of the same story from different authors. The key topics of the top stories are also extracted automatically and shown in the sidebar. Meanwhile, classification is used to assign stories to the appropriate categories (Business, Health, World News, and so on). There's also content recommendation, as the service takes into account user preferences and offers a personalised list of articles. All this is done with minimal input from human editors."", '\nGoogle News automatically gathers related stories together and lists the key topics.', ""Machine learning is here to stay. Businesses are turning to these tools as a way to make sense of ever-growing datasets and seek competitive advantages. Big companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have talked about the transformation of their engineering and business to focus on data driven approaches. Academic publications and open source libraries like Google's TensorFlow\xa0are enabling wider access to these techniques. Even the notoriously insular Apple have started allowing their employees to publish\xa0machine learning papers, just so they can compete for the pool of talented researchers."", 'Despite this, machine learning remains shrouded in hype and harried by fear-mongering around the perils of artificial intelligence.

Developing new business models', 'How to start creating value with IoT']","['IoT has been a hot topic for many years now. There are dozens of research papers and blog posts that preach about the endless possibilities of the IoT. Even though there are a few success stories most of the promised value still remains unlocked.', 'According to the Gartner Hype Cycle for Internet of Things (below), the IoT itself is on the highest peak of inflated expectations for the third year in a row. I think that there are three reasons why it hasn‚Äôt moved anywhere from there.', '\nSource: http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-technologies-underpin-the-hype-cycle-for-the-internet-of-things-2016/', 'The first reason is that of course, we are still waiting\xa0for the technology to become even cheaper than it already is. When building large scale solutions there is a big difference between 5 euro sensor and 20 cents sensor. There isn‚Äôt a quick fix for this one. The other reason is that we are too afraid to build the ecosystems that the huge potential of the IoT requires. Many of the biggest opportunities would require an open culture and ability to co-create but there are too many questions about the business models and opening our business to others is harder than it sounds. The third reason is that we are still too focused on the technology of the IoT and not that much of the user - the human - that needs the solution. That‚Äôs why we struggle to find real value in the IoT solutions. In many cases, the question of the IoT solution is can we and not should we. Most of the time the answer to the first one is yes but the second one is much trickier.', 'The reason we struggle with the value is that we forget that the IoT is merely an enabler for great solutions and services. It‚Äôs easy and fun to focus on the new technology but the technology-first is a much\xa0harder approach to create huge value than starting from the human with needs. I would guess that the Facebook wasn‚Äôt created just because Mark Zuckerberg had a computer and access to the internet but because he saw that humans need an easier way to interact.', 'Inspired by the book The Amazon Way on IoT I‚Äôve grouped ways to create value with IoT into three categories. Sometimes you can do all these with a single solution and that will most likely be a huge success.', 'We can make the customer experience smoother with IoT by automating and thus eliminating unnecessary interactions. We can also use new ways to interact with our services from simple physical buttons to augmented reality and different kinds of movement detectors. Such interactions can make our service work based on the actions the user does anyway (such as walk) and not based on the actions the user needs to do separately (click the button ‚ÄúI‚Äôm walking‚Äù). By measuring where, how and why our products are used, R&D department can develop better features to our existing products. With IoT and all the data collected, we can customize our services to be more personal for the user. For example, Finnair and Finavia are experimenting with facial recognition\xa0when entering the airport. This way we can travel without showing the boarding pass to anyone.', 'If you are an industrial player this is most likely where you‚Äôd like to start. It‚Äôs easy to see the benefits through savings. But this is not that different from the previous point. It‚Äôs still automating and reducing interactions but the customer here is an employee. We might even call it the intranet of things since only people inside our company is using it. To figure out where to start we can use the Lean principles. The operational efficiency will increase when we eliminate the 7 wastes (transport, inventory, motion, waiting, overprocessing, overproduction, defects). The most famous example of improving supply chain efficiency with IoT is probably Amazon with its robotic warehouses.', 'The other way to make operations more efficient is to break the silos inside our organization. Making information more transparent and faster through IoT, we reduce the bottlenecks and people can make better decisions. Even though the main benefit from increased operational efficiency is for the company and the employees itself, it usually benefits also customer by reducing delivery times, improving quality and lowering costs.', 'Creating something new is always harder than improving something that already exists. New business models in IoT means for example ecosystems, platforms and selling and buying data. Also, a lot of smaller scale solutions can be new business models to your company but the large scale solutions will bring more payback and are obviously tempting. To do these we need to overcome our fears and to open up and co-create with other companies. An example of new thinking and a new business model with IoT is the Nokian Tyres SnapSkan tire scanner.', 'To decide where to start depends obviously where you are currently with exploiting the IoT. If you are not in the game at all start with simple tracking and visualizations. Use the dashboards to improve your operational efficiency and to give better information for decision making. Don‚Äôt be too intimidated by the internet of everything but start with the internet of something and scale up.', 'If you already have some solutions, try using data science and the collected data to get better insights on your products, operations or customers and improve based on those insights. With those insights, you might be able to even adjust processes automatically. If this is already business as usual to you, start doing explorations to new business models. What could you or your customers do with the data collected? Or what data is still missing? Your customers probably already combine your products/services with something else. Could you make that easier or add those features to your products/services?\xa0Be open and do a lot of small experiments and prepare to scale to ones that work.', 'When doing explorations always start with the human user and focus first on finding a problem worth solving. Only after founding that, start thinking about the solution. If the problem is somehow in the physical world you can use tools like IoT Service Kit (iotservicekit.com) to come up with the solutions. Sometimes you might also notice that you don‚Äôt need IoT to solve the biggest problem the user has. In these cases, you should forget the IoT since pursuing the technology there where it is not needed you end up with a solution that does not solve the problem.', 'IoT will influence all businesses sooner or later. The new business models will change the way we do things and how we behave. Those who will develop successful IoT solutions have started with the customer value and human needs in mind. They have started small, explored a lot and scaled what has worked.', 'See also: 7 design principles for Internet of Things', 'The best way to create value with an IoT solution is to start with the human needs. The best way to not create value with an IoT solution is to not start at all.', 'If you‚Äôd like to discuss more of the IoT, check out our IoT offering in iot.futurice.com and don‚Äôt be afraid to contact me/us.']",[]

Media is struggling with moderation demands and major news sites are closing down commenting on their articles, because they are being used to drive an unrelated political agenda, or just for trolling. Moderation practise cannot rely on humans anymore, because a single person can easily generate copious amounts of content, and moderation needs to be done with care. It‚Äôs simply much more time consuming than cut and pasting your hate or ads all across the internet. Anonymity adds to the problem, as it seems to bring out the worst in people.', ""The solution would monitor public communications of the candidates in social media and attempt to flag those that contain hate speech, as it is defined by the European Commission and Ethics Journalism Network in https://www.article19.org/data/files/medialibrary/38231/'Hate-Speech'-Explained---A-Toolkit-(2015-Edition).pdf."", 'The non-discrimination ombudsman (government official appointed by our government to oversee such matters) would review the results.

Moderation by algorithms is already done, just not transparently. An example? Perspective API by Jigsaw (formerly Google Ideas) uses machine learning models to score the perceived impact a comment might have on a conversation. The corporations that run the platforms we broadcast our lives on are not very forthcoming in opening up these AI models. The intelligence agencies of course even less so.', 'So we feel there‚Äôs a need for more open science. This technology will reshape our communication and our world. We all need to better understand its capabilities and limitations.', 'We understand that automatic online discussion monitoring is a very sensitive topic, but we trust the involved parties ‚Äì specifically the non-discrimination ombudsman of Finland ‚Äì to use the technology ethically and in line with the Finnish law.', 'In this article our Data Scientist Teemu Kinnunen shares what we have done.', 'The hate speech detection problem is very challenging. There are virtually unlimited ways how people can express thoughts including also hate speech. Therefore, it is impossible to write rules by hand or a list of hate words, and thus, we crafted a method using machine learning algorithms.', 'The main goal in the project was to develop a tool that can process messages in social media and highlight the most likely messages containing hate speech for manual inspection. Therefore, we needed to design a process to find potential hate speech messages and to train the hate speech detector during the experiment period. The process we used in the project is described in Fig. 1.', '![](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/6GPFF6AVeo4k6mYc2CQsiI/deaafc4cb2325576078d849d7491dfdb/hate-speech-detection-blog-post-draft--2iznktyj5j_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png)\nFigure 1: Process diagram for hate speech detection.', 'At first, a manually labeled training set was collected by a University researcher. A subset from a dataset consists of public Facebook discussions from Finnish groups, collected for a University research project HYBRA, as well as another dataset containing messages about populist politicians and minorities from the Suomi24 discussion board. The training set was coded by several coders to confirm agreement of the data (kappa > .7). The training set was used to select a feature extraction and machine learning method and to train a model for hate speech detection. Then we deployed a trained model that was trained with manually labeled training samples. Next, we downloaded social media messages from a previous day and predicted their hate speech scores. We sorted the list of messages based on predicted hate speech scores and send messages and their scores to a manual inspection. After the manual inspection, we got new training samples which we used to retrain the hate speech detection model.', 'There are many methods to extract features from text. We started with standard Natural Language Processing methods such as stemming and Bag-of-Words (BoW). At first, we stemmed words in the messages using Snowball method in the Natural Language Toolkit library (NLTK). Next, we generated a vocabulary for bag-of-words using the messages in manually labelled training samples. Finally, to extract features for each message, we computed a distribution of different words in the message i.e. how many times each word in the vocabulary exists in the message.Some of the words appear nearly in each message, and therefore, provide less distinctive information. Therefore, we gave different weights for each word based on how often they appear in different messages using the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency weighting (TF-IDF). TF-IDF gives higher importance for the words which are only in few documents (or messages in our case).', 'One of the problems in bag-of-features is that it does not have any knowledge about semantics of words. The similarity between two messages is calculated based on how many matching words there are in the messages (and their weights from TF-IDF). Therefore, we tried word embeddings which encodes words that are semantically similar with similar vectors. For example, a distance from an encoding of ‚Äòcat‚Äô to an encoding of ‚Äòdog‚Äô is smaller than a distance from an encoding of ‚Äòcat‚Äô to an encoding of ‚Äòice-cream ‚Äô. There is an excellent tutorial to word embeddings on Tensorflow site https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec for those who wants to learn more.', 'In practice, we used the fastText (https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) library with pre-trained models. With fastText, one can convert words into vector space where semantically similar words tend to appear close by each other. However, we need to have a single vector for each message instead of having varying number of vectors depending on the number of words in a message. Therefore, we used a very simple, yet effective, method: we computed a mean of word encodings.', 'The task in this project was to detect hate speech, which is a binary classification task. I.e the goal was to classify each sample into a no-hate-speech or a hate-speech class. In addition to the binary classification, we gave a probability score for each message, which we used to sort messages based on how likely they were hate speech.', 'There are many machine learning algorithms for binary classification task. It is difficult to know which of the methods would perform the best. Therefore, we tested a few of the most popular ones and choose the one that performed the best. We chose to test Naive Bayes, because it has been performing well in spam classification tasks and hate speech detection is similar to that. In addition we chose to test Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), because they tend to perform very well in the most challenging tasks.', 'There are many methods for feature extraction and machine learning that can be used to detect hate speech. It is not evident which of the methods would work the best. Therefore, we carried out an experiment where we tested different combinations of feature extraction and machine learning methods and evaluated their performance.', 'To carry out an experiment, we needed to have a set of known sample messages containing hate speech and samples that do not contain hate speech. Aalto researcher Matti Nelimarkka, Juho P√§√§kk√∂nen, HU researcher Salla-Maaria Laaksonen and Teemu Ropponen (OKFI) labeled manually 1500 samples which were used for training and evaluating models.', '1500 known samples is not much for such as challenging problem. Therefore, we used k-Fold cross-validation with 10 splits (k=10). In this case, we can use 90% sample for training and 10% for testing the model.

The challenge is to find a balance between TPR and FPR so that TPR is high but FPR is low.', 'Based on the results presented in Fig. FIGEXP, we chose to use BOW + SVM to detect hate speech. It clearly outperformed other methods and provided the best TPR which was important for us, because we wanted to sort the messages based on how likely they were hate speech.', 'Based on the experiment, we chose a feature extraction and machine learning method to train a model for hate speech detection. In practice, we used the score of the binary classifier to sort the messages for manual inspection and annotation.', 'We ran the detector once a day. At first, we downloaded social media messages from a previous day, then predicted hate speech (scored each message) and stored the result in a CSV-file. Next, we converted this CSV-file to Excel for manual inspection. After manual inspection, we got new training samples which were used to retrain the hate speech detection model.', 'During the field experiment, we found out that the model was able to sort the messages based on the likelihood of containing hate speech. However, the model was originally trained with more biased set of samples, and therefore, it gave rather high scores also for messages not containing hate speech. Therefore, manual inspection was required to make the final decision for the most prominent messages. Further measures concerning these messages were done by the Indiscrimination Ombudsman [who contacted certain parties regarding the findings].', 'In a few weeks, we built a tool for hate speech detection to assist officials to harvest social media for hate speech. The model was trained with rather few samples for such a difficult problem. Therefore, the performance of the model was not perfect, but it was able to find a few most likely messages containing hate speech among hundreds of messages published each day.', 'In this work, training -> predicting -> manual inspection -> retraining - iteration loop was necessary, because in the beginning, we had quite limited set of training samples and the style of the hate speech can change rapidly e.g. when something surprising and big happens (A terrorist attack in Sweden happened during the pilot). The speed of the iteration loop defines how efficiently the detector works.', 'Source codes for the project can be found in GitHub: https://github.com/futurice/spice-hate_speech_detection', 'The researchers are organizing a workshop to discuss automated detection of hate speech at Association of Internet Researchers annual conference 2017. https://aoir.org/aoir2017/preconworkshop/#LHP', 'This blog post was written in co-operation with Matti Nelimarkka and Salla-Maaria Laaksonen.']",[]

I have learnt and now believe that preparing and sharing food opens up to inclusion and cohesion.', 'At Futurice, I recently worked on three different concepts for a service that would help British lower-middle class and busy families to have a more diverse, balanced diet.

Every small decision we have to take raises so many questions that we tend to consume what is already prepared and given to us.', 'At this point I started to see clearly that designing a welcoming, informative and easy-to-use service is not enough for overcoming consumers‚Äô difficulties.

Thinking happens in the mind and can‚Äôt change things outside of one‚Äôs own thoughts.', 'Why are so many companies fascinated by this concept? Is Design Thinking the ‚Äúholy grail‚Äù some claim it is?', 'A new movement started in the community a few years back and discussion shifted from ‚ÄúDesign Thinking‚Äù to ‚ÄúDesign Doing‚Äù - the actual application of ‚ÄúDesign Thinking‚Äù.

Focusing on good design solves problems and sparks innovation.', 'It‚Äôs what great designers have been doing for centuries.', 'The typical Design Thinking process helps us gain an understanding of how great designers approach a problem. Principles such as user-centricity, iterative working and collaborative design build the core. To help our clients to apply a design mindset to their work, Futurice developed the Lean Service Creation (LSC) toolkit. It consists of best practices from hundreds of projects, blending service design, user-centric approaches, lean business thinking, agile development and lean startup mentality: https://www.leanservicecreation.com/', 'A short intro course to ‚ÄúDesign Thinking‚Äù is a good starting point. However, a way of thinking and a deeply intrinsic (company) culture cannot be changed in a day. Understanding comes from continuous application. Implementing projects with experts is the only way to gain a holistic understanding of the design principles. Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day and you will not become an expert overnight. The devil is in the details ‚Äì the subtle differences and challenges in each project. No book or process can teach you about real life obstacles and how to solve them. An experienced and diverse team can.', 'Many of our clients have drawers full of great ideas, just laying around. There are many reasons for this inaction, but one key obstacle is missing skills. It takes more than ‚ÄúDesign Thinking‚Äù to bring ideas alive. Hands-on design and development skills are needed to implement a digital service. It involves actual UX and UI design, as well as programming, right? This is where a multidisciplinary and agile way of working comes into play. The best and most effective way of working is to create diverse teams. (Yeah, design-only teams and the waterfall model are so 90s.) Working in small teams of designers, developers, engineers and business people is not only more fun and effective but mitigates risks and increases the chances of success.', 'Well, damn it. If design thinking training alone doesn‚Äôt work, what can companies do to be more innovative?', 'Many companies have embraced lean and user-centered principles of prototyping and quick experimentation, but they often stop short of providing a truly safe space to experiment. Employees are told to be innovative, but their performance goals and compensation models don‚Äôt create the incentives to do so. Experimenting and taking risks is not rewarded. Instead of embraced as a learning experience, failure is treated as a sign of incompetence. Innovation is risky. Fostering growth through trial and error means giving people the freedom to learn. It‚Äôs a matter of trusting people and having confidence in them. And yes, it means you have to give up control and stop micro managing.', 'Companies invest in innovation hubs and factories to bring ideas to life without giving individuals the tools and processes to make them work. A cool space, an unlimited amount of post-its and a few bean bag chairs aren‚Äôt enough - especially in big corporations, where employees‚Äô software choices are limited and everything that‚Äôs not Microsoft Office and SAP requires additional work for IT departments to purchase and support. This means making exceptions and taking risks. These teams don‚Äôt get these additional tools as a symbol of status, they are their standard everyday working tools - without them they can‚Äôt do their work.', 'Striving for perfection used to be a competitive advantage. German manufacturing companies pride themselves for their engineering quality - ‚ÄúMade in Germany‚Äù was a guarantee. While perfection might have its advantages in mass production, when it comes to innovation, perfection kills ideas before they are even born. Perfecting products or services also takes a lot of time ‚Äì time that is we don‚Äôt have in today‚Äôs fast-paced world. Innovation requires the ability to try out ideas quickly, iterate fast, throw away old ideas and try many more. While the first prototype or idea might not be the jack of all trades device one expects and far from perfect, it has the potential to grow, develop and become the next big thing.', 'While great management skills are indispensable in companies, in small agile innovation teams there‚Äôs no space and need for hierarchy and delegation. Ideas only turn into reality in the hands of people with practical skills; people who roll up their sleeves and create. Hire makers! Designers, developers, engineers. They will help bring ideas to life. If you don‚Äôt have them at hand, work with external experts, agencies and hands-on consultancies. Many employees can ideate innovative solutions, but only makers can realise them.', 'New ventures often struggle when they are judged by the same metrics used to evaluate activities that the company has been involved in for decades. It‚Äôs very unlikely that a new idea will generate the same profits that proven and optimised activities do. New initiatives can‚Äôt compete at the same level and they are killed off before they‚Äôve had a chance to prove themselves. Some clients are really surprised to see how much effort, time and money it takes to create an application. They think the work is done once the new service is programmed, but the fact is, it hasn‚Äôt even started. Think up realistic metrics, because you can‚Äôt weigh a little baby using the same standards with which you weigh a middle-aged person.', 'Even when companies talk about how innovation is a top priority, few succeed at creating a culture of innovation in which employees are truly empowered to generate, develop and grow great ideas. They overspend on idea collection activities, then wonder why they fail to meet their innovation goals.

What a waste of effort, right? Isn't the whole point of programming to spend effort efficiently? Lucky for us, somebody else has already done the hard work, and created Xamarin Forms."", 'For the uninitiated, Xamarin Forms is a cross-platform framework that allows you to share both UI code and business logic across platforms. It targets Android, iOS, Windows Phone 8.1 RT, Univeral Windows Platform and, soon, MacOS. It sits on top of ""regular"" Xamarin which provides C# bindings to the Android and iOS SDKs, and allows you write cross-platform business logic, but requires platform-specific UI code.', ""I'd been interested in Xamarin Forms for a while, so when I had an opportunity to write a brand new app, I jumped at the chance."", ""The project in question was a small (about 7 or 8 screens, no extensive animation of theming) mobile app. Our goal was to hit Android, iOS and WP8, and we had a deadline of around 5 months. The development team consisted of myself and the esteemed Mikko Toivanen. We both had extensive experience in Windows development, especially around the 'XAML-y' frameworks, which made picking up Xamarin Forms very easy. As such, we decided to do all our UI in XAML and lean heavily on an MVVM architecture and Xamarin Forms' binding framework."", 'We came in on time and under budget. Both Mikko and I agreed that working with the framework itself was surprisingly pleasant, and we would definitely do so again, given the opportunity.', ""(In fact, we found it so pleasant, that we decided to take out all of the useful stuff, and make a starter project template out of it. Check out Xalami if you're thinking about starting a Xamarin Forms project of your own!)"", ""After tallying it up, we came out to a whopping 85% code shared between platforms--and that's a fairly conservative estimate. If you only count code we actually wrote (i.e. ignore the boilerplate template code), it probably comes closer to 90% or so."", ""That's the short version of the story. I had a lot of fun working this project, and it definitely paid off for us. But I can't spend the whole post gushing, so why don't we start by talking about..."", ""That is, the parts that didn't work, the parts that frustrated us, the parts that spiked our WTFs / min through the roof...all that."", ""This one is a little harder to quantity, because I can't point to just one or two things and say There. That's the issue right there. But both Mikko and I felt that we spent a lot of time fighting the build system, and that when it did break, it often broke in surprising ways, or gave misleading or unhelpful error messages."", 'One particularly egregious example that ate up about an hour of my time happened when I accidentally imported a type from the Windows.UI.Xaml namespace in the PCL project. This resulted in the Windows platform DLL being included in the PCL build, which wrought all sorts of havoc. I was confronted with 1800 errors, and only told something about a duplicate .winmd. I ended up having to do some Git forensics to figure out where I broke the build, and finally isolate the one line that did it: using Windows.UI.Xaml buried in one of my IValueConverters.', ""Windows Phone 8.1 support was one of the customer's requirements. Unfortunately, reflecting its lack of broader market share, WP8's support in Xamarin Forms is spotty at best. We ran into a few problems that sucked up a fairly dispropotionate amount of developer time."", 'Xamarin Forms comes with 6 font styles out of the box, which it calls Device Styles.

We submitted a bug report and a PR with a partial fix that ultimately resulted in a real fix that should be in Xamarin Forms 2.3.5, so this story ultimately has a happy ending. Hooray!"", ""We ran into the same issue described in this MSDN blog post--namely, trying to access application resources that live in a Portable Class Library (henceforth PCL) from a WinRT context, you get a MissingManifestResourceException. Tracking this one down was an interesting rabbit hole of debugging, and we're lucky we noticed it at all--we only experienced it in Release, on a physical device. This could have very easily been a bug that snuck up on us after releasing to the store, resulting in much wailing and gnashing of teeth."", ""We ended up using solution #2 from the above blog post--some truly dirty runtime Reflection-based hacking where we sneak into our .resx file's generated class, and replace its .NET ResourceManager with a WinRT ResourceLoader. Easily one of the dirtiest hacks I've ever had to employ in a shipping product."", ""In fairness, this one isn't totally Xamarin's fault--it's more a consequence of trying to use PCL .resx resources from WinRT, but it's still a hurdle that we likely wouldn't have had in a platform-native project."", ""Whew! Now that that's out of the way, let's get to the fun parts. I said at the beginning that both Mikko and I agreed that the platform was pleasant, so let's justify that!"", 'Since Xamarin Forms is a XAML-based framework, virtually all of our WPF/Silverlight/WinRT knowledge was able to transfer over. There were some stumbling blocks as we learned the quirks and idiosyncrasies of a new flavor of XAML, but for the most part it just worked how we expected. As an added bonus, any .NET libraries that worked in PCLs worked just fine here, too. JSON.NET, MVVM Light, Akavache and Reactive Extensions were all welcome companions on this project.', ""If you've got any previous experience in a recent .NET ecosystem, a lot of that knowledge is going to carry right over."", ""I've used Java Swing and Windows Forms, and those two frameworks were enough to convince me that manual UI twiddling in code is for the birds. Since being introduced to binding-and-markup-based frameworks, as Xamarin Forms' XAML is, I've come to enjoy the way it encourages good design, and handles the messy stateful UI management for you."", ""If you've spent time in Silverlight or WPF development, you're probably nodding your head right now. If not, a quick demonstration is in order."", 'Here, we have a class named TranslateExtension that lives in the ProjectName.Extensions namespace that implements the IMarkupExtension interface. The interface defines a single ProvideValue method that returns an object. In the case of our little TranslateExtension here, it does the work of going and looking up a localized string, and returning it. This allows a super concise form of localizing resources in XAML.', 'This is much nicer than the more common song-and-dance in WinRT-land of {Binding Source={StaticResource SomeResxGeneratedClass}, Path=SomeVariableName}.', 'We also had an ImageExtension which returned an ImageSource appropriately scaled for the platform and screen size, just by referring to the filename. Way easier than any alternative I could think of.', 'I know this might seem obvious, but it was a little hard to swallow the pitch: I can write an entire cross-platform application with shared code? Nah, no way.', 'But the truth is, we came out with the majority of our code being shared between platforms, and neither of us had to learn much more Android or iOS or Windows than we already knew. Development was easy, the apps ran well, looked native and were easy to maintain.', ""You'll probably fight your tools a little bit (and when don't you?), and probably have days where your WTFs per minute approach critical mass. But at the end of the day, you get to write your application once, in a feature-rich, modern language and, like magic, deploy it on more platforms than you can shake a stick at."", 'Thumbs-up, would use again.', '![Creative Commons License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.']","['Body text', 'Caption text', 'List Item text', 'List Item detail text', 'Subtitle text', 'and Title text.']"

The colleagues look slightly sceptical :)', ""I've taught service design methodology for 4+ years at Aalto University. I started with an ideal situation: a clean slate, a non-mandatory course, and freedom to teach it\xa0any way I want.\xa0If you have ever taught in a university, you appreciate the opportunity start from scratch and have no formal bureaucracy peeking over your shoulder."", 'The course is known as Digital Service Design (CS-E5002 in Aalto University coding). It is taught every Monday afternoon (circa 4h of lectures & workshopping per session)\xa0in period 1 (i.e. six weeks from September to mid October). In the course I have four teams of four students. I do the teaching and coaching plus I have two mentors helping the students outside the official lecture times.', 'Long story short: the course has been a huge success. It has won awards as one of the best in Aalto Computer Science (three times, I think), and it was a one of the key arguments in awarding me the teacher of the year in Aalto School of Science, in 2016.', 'I believe it\xa0has become a success because I have learned so much from others: students, visiting lecturers, and fellow teachers. That is why I want to give back and share some of my thoughts and lessons learned behind the course. And also, in the spirit of open source, I share my (almost) unadulterated, unfiltered, unabridged slides I used in teaching the course in Fall 2016.', ""Have a real company (or organisation) with a real business goal. Much of design work is not mastering a method, but understanding the surroundings and applying the methods. Without a real company and a real\xa0case the students don't bump into\xa0the unseen challenges and opportunities that messy reality is full of."", 'However, having a real case in the course for students to work with\xa0means that you have to do a lot of groundwork to get those cases, and then massage them\xa0to fit the course schedule and context. Obviously, the course is not 100% business reality because\xa0the course‚Äôs main goal is to teach the students, and at the end of the day, that overrules the actual business goal. Making this clear helps you, the students, and the client company manage the expectations. Which brings me to the next principle...', 'To get a real company case, the course must be beneficial to the client company. This is not as easy as it sounds. Sometimes companies just ‚Äúthrow the dog a bone‚Äù rather than making the most out of the fact that super smart students are putting hundreds hours of their time into solving the company‚Äôs problem under professional supervision. Having seen hundreds of\xa0real business projects and hundreds of student projects, I know that students projects are enormously undervalued. Students are very, very smart and talented. Especially under good guidance and coaching from the teachers and the client representative.', 'Once the client company realises how to benefit from the student work it becomes part of the client‚Äôs other ‚Äúprocesses‚Äù. This means that they take the course seriously and they have a true interest in helping the students as much as possible. To make this happen, there must be a dedicated person from the client side that has a personal interest in the course and the students creating something useful.', 'This bridging between the client company and the students\' work will not be automatic. I typically start ""selling"" the course to companies in the Spring, over three months before the course to help the clients be ready to maximise the great work the students will create.', 'In my course the students have only six weeks to consume, digest, and analyse a huge amount of information, inspiration, and creativity. To speed up the process the key is to have every team present their findings and thinking as often as possible. And to present it in a packaged format that requires the team to understand where they are and what they know and don‚Äôt know. Forcing the teams to produce a coherent message of their current thinking and status is extremely productive in helping the team to see what is important, to build a shared understanding, and to focus on relevant next steps.', 'The Lean Service Creation canvases work here perfectly. They give good focus to the discussions and they also force all the teams into same format. In addition, in the past years I have asked the teams to produce a short video after each week (according to the theme of the week, such as, value proposition or experimentation), and these videos are then shared with clients and fellow students. This is pretty much the only documentation or reporting I make the students do during the course, and it has worked like a charm.', 'A method course should be hands-on. That is obvious. However, I think that before applying a method, one has to understand the theory behind it. That is why I have short(ish) lectures (30-40minutes) with lot of examples and often some pair exercises to help the students understand the theory. More time goes into coaching the teams with their company cases. In other words, going from team to team\xa0and helping them to apply what was just lectured to them.', 'Due to student feedback, I\xa0created a special ‚Äúclinic‚Äù outside class, where the course mentors and myself help the students further. I noticed that the students need one or two days to work on their topics (i.e., to digest all the new knowledge) and then they are ready for the next round coaching.', 'Also, I have now framed the client‚Äôs role as a coach of the team rather than a ‚Äúclient who judges your final results‚Äù. This breaks down the prejudice that the client has all the right answers and is just waiting for the team to ‚Äúget it right‚Äù. Rather, the client-as-a-coach helps the team to compete the other teams by doing her/his share and removing obstacles and barriers in front of the team (e.g., helps in arranging customer interviews, provides access to data, meets the team on a weekly basis etc).', 'I did not have time to make these slides into a more approachable set but I do hope that these help teachers, coaches and educators\xa0anywhere to get ideas and re-use things when teaching Lean Service Creation or service design in general. The only changes I made to the original slides was that I took away some photographs of people that I didn‚Äôt have time to ask permission. The Powerpoint files have also some notes in them (in Finnish or English) so check them out. I also included my grading review (not the grades, though) from last Fall, so you can see how I evaluate the work for the final grade.', 'Let me know if these slides are helpful, and whether I should spend some time making them more understandable :)', 'Here they are:Introduction to Lean Service Creation and the courseCustomer Insights and InterviewingIdeation and Value propositionsBusiness Model and Customer JourneyExperiments and MVPStorytelling and PresentingGrading/evaluation', '\nEdward and Jouni working on their company case in the DSD course.']",[]

New digital technologies emerge fast and revolutionize industries. Consumer behavior and values keep changing. Old truths no longer hold.

On the one hand, crafting a digital agenda that is comprehensive enough to make all the changes needed and covers more than a handful of digital concept development initiatives isn‚Äôt easy.

But digital transformation can also mean a shift towards a completely new industry, e.g. from news publishing to technology or data provision; from financial services to housing or automobile business; and so on. A key ingredient of a proper digital agenda is exploration of new opportunities and competitors inside and outside the given industry.', 'After clarifying why you need a digital agenda, you need to understand what core activities and value chains can be improved through digital tools and new ways of working. This boils down to the WHAT question: what actions does the company need to take to fully benefit from digitalization in its business operations and functions? To answer the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù question thoroughly, the following perspectives must be considered:', 'While all the above-mentioned activities on the digital agenda are important and complementary, they are not necessarily equally important in all firms and shouldn‚Äôt be tackled simultaneously. For example, companies that already have a handle on digital marketing may want focus on R&D to boost their digital competitiveness. Some companies may wish to work on customer-facing things this spring and turn their attention to technologies and ecosystems in the autumn. A talented business leader knows how to prioritize the digital agenda‚Äôs core activities and make a roadmap that defines timelines and resourcing for the work.', 'Finally, making an impact with digital is also very much a HOW issue. If companies want to fulfill their digital visions and succeed in their digital core activities, they need to have certain set of enablers in place:', 'To summarize the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and ‚Äúhow‚Äù above: a proper digital agenda is comprehensive and it typically combines business, design, technology and data. It links with the overall business objectives of the company to ensure business relevance. It sets a clear direction for activities, inspires and sparks people to take action and engages real professionals from inside and outside the company. A proper digital agenda pivots the company towards it customers, helps better understand their needs and delivers customer benefits as well as improved customer experiences. A company that fully embraces digital also typically cherishes data, insights and measurability in everything that is done.', 'A proper digital agenda describes an inspiring journey that the company is about to take, something that touches the hearts and minds of the customers, employees, managers, partners and the society around the firm. It sounds very ambitious, but companies should not be satisfied with anything less.', 'Business leaders should not accept a digital agenda if it isn‚Äôt', 'Needless to say, the various items in the digital agenda include massive amounts of details that need special attention. And in the art of doing the right things the right way, the devil really is in the details.', 'The areas discussed above are all rich veins we can mine for future blog posts, so stay tuned.

Consider the structure of a list vs an array:', 'When we add a new element to the front (or back depending how you look at it) we just have to create one element that points to the first element of the old list (we run in O(1)).

But that kind of thinking is obviously nonsense. I spend quite a bit of my time looking at and interviewing developers for jobs at Futurice, and there are specific things I‚Äôm looking for, things that are not applicable to all development jobs but are very applicable to us. I cannot just go googling ‚Äúquestions to ask a software engineer‚Äù and base an interview on the top hits.', 'Take Donald Knuth, for instance. Widely considered a great programmer. He is especially good at algorithms, having designed several famous ones. But we have little need of algorithm design capability and it doesn‚Äôt seem to correlate with the abilities we need, positively or negatively. As an interviewer, it would not give me any relevant information to have a candidate solve an algorithm design problem, let alone solve one during the interview.', 'Donald Knuth is a perfectionist. When his books weren‚Äôt typeset well, he spent 10 years making his own typesetting system. Perfectionism is not what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm looking for an engineering mindset, someone with the ability to evaluate different approaches, weigh their tradeoffs, and select the appropriate one based on the constraints of the situation. No client of ours is going to accept us spending 10 years to implement the perfect programming language to implement their service in.', 'Donald Knuth has used only one programming language for 30 years or so. What I look for is curiosity, a willingness to go beyond one‚Äôs current comfort zone to discover new and improved ways of doing things. Sticking with a non-evolving language screams the opposite to me. It‚Äôs not a problem not to be a master of several languages but I do expect following the trends in one‚Äôs primary language or languages and some awareness of what other sorts of languages are doing, with a bonus for understanding how to apply those techniques in the primary language.', 'Communication with Donald Knuth has a huge latency and is by letters. This style is not at all acceptable for us. Communication within the team is constant, communication with the client is frequent. Communicating even via Jira or a similar story and issue tracking system is too inefficient. We need people who at the early stage of their career can communicate their ideas among their fellow developers and, in more advanced stages, to the clients as well, putting their reasoning in terms understandable also to non-developers.', 'This all is why I wouldn‚Äôt hire Donald Knuth.

In second part - as we explore whether the technology is finally mature enough to have a mainstream impact - we look at the issues on a more detailed level: portability, control and touch.', 'One of the more unpleasant parts of the high end VR experience (in addition to nausea and suddenly losing your feet under you) is the cords that trail behind you, causing you to stumble and reminding you are still firmly attached to this world. In AR, the cords will be overall less common (mainly justified by much higher end experience as Meta 2 is trying to do). However, VR has more challenges to overcome and slightly less to gain, meaning getting rid of the cords is closer to 5 year than 2 year timeline.', 'Untethered experience is undeniably the final destination in the development of VR. Current attempts to squeeze the device into portable format are at the same time amusing and intriguing. Already many manufacturers are attempting to emulate the high(er) end experience without external computers. However, as we are still improving the experience itself, it will take probably closer to 5 years before we even can start squeezing in this high-end experience into portable formats.', 'Some challenges requiring even more power in the future include higher image quality and\xa0screen technology improvements. Or like Valve CEO Gabe Nevell puts it, ""Headsets are going to get lighter, they\'re going to get smaller, the resolution is going to go up. These aren\'t speculative things -- You\'ll see the VR industry leapfrogging any other display technology. You\'ll start to see that happening in 2018 and 2019 when you\'ll be talking about incredibly high resolutions.""', 'Next up, then is the hot topic of simply getting rid of the cords and transmitting the data wirelessly. This is a lot more difficult than it sounds, particularly as you cannot compress the video stream as it needs to be real-time in order to respond to user actions.', ""Two HTC Vive partners have announced to have a wireless solution at CES\xa02017: TPCAST and Intel. TPCAST has promised to deliver an affordable solution in Q2; Intel was even more secretive and simply stated it's solution will use\xa0WiGig, which allowes the devices to communicate wirelessly with multi-gigabit speeds. Intel does have a prototype though that was shown off at\xa0MWC."", ""Quark VR has been experimenting with cutting cords off HTC Vive as well. Their\xa0pre-existing product seems to stream data to devices similar to the way Unity Remote does.\xa0In their future wireless solution, they claim to use WiFi to send the signals with a simple add-on on the device. Achieving this might require quite a lot of trickery, especially with issues with latency and the need for an extremely high speed wifi. Quark has told it is working on some final issues but it remains to be seen when this product is market ready.\xa0There's no news for actual product yet though they initially promised one by the end of 2016."", 'MIT labs has approached this from a different angle in their MoVR project, checking how to use less-used high frequency radio signals (millimeter waves). Mm waves can transfer a lot of information and are currently underused, though there is a lot of research on that front in many other domains as well.', 'There are issues with this approach, particularly that the signal is easily blocked, which means that the movement of the user needs to be calculated and compensated on the fly. MoVR‚Äôs biggest idea is in fact circumventing this problem in reconfiguring the device to reflect the signals in novel ways so they would always reach the receiver, even when at odd angles. In the long term this would enable multiple users in the same space without signal blocking or interference. MIT researches claim you can‚Äôt stream multiview-video on modern wifi, which means Quark is in an interesting position to prove their solution.', 'Another way to approach the untethered experience is to simply squeeze the device into a (semi)portable format, like Microsoft has done in the AR side with their HoloLens.', 'Facebook‚Äôs ‚ÄúSanta Cruz‚Äù prototype, revealed at the end of 2016, is a cross between Samsung‚Äôs mobile-based Gear VR and their flagship product Oculus Rift. This prototype is not to be mixed with the experience on high end device backed by juicy computer, whether that is using wireless or tethered connection. Santa Cruz has no set deadline for publishing yet, which tells how far yet are from even medium portable experience. There are important points in the product though, such as an additional 4 cameras to track the world around you to avoid collisions. With this kind of portable VR, we‚Äôll start to see more VR accommodating to the real world and also real world injected in the virtual one.', ""Intel has promised to have their Project Alloy prototype by Q4/2017.\xa0Qualcomm has promised a VRDK in Q2/2017 using their Snapdragon processors and standalone headset.\xa0I would not hold my breath yet but in couple years we'll definitely see interesting entrances in the mid-range standalone devices."", 'In the 5 year span, the most powerful experiences will still benefit from the combination of wireless transfer and powerful non-portable computer while squeezing the headset to the bare minimum. But keep in mind that the mainstream users, the mythical ‚Äúbillion‚Äù will most likely never use that. They‚Äôll make do with their mobiles - and in a couple years with those slightly better fully portable standalone devices that Facebook and its competitors are pushing.', 'Finding your way and interacting with the new environment is one of the key challenges in the virtual and augmented realm. In the short term, hand controllers will be the norm. Specialized controllers that are either visible in your virtual world, blinking and showing options (Vive) or controllers that can mimic your hand movements (Oculus Touch) will be used for several years.', 'In the long term, the physical controllers will diversify and generic ones will disappear. Most interactions will be done with gestures and voice and the physical controllers will take place where it most makes sense: when we want a device resembling its real-world counterpart, or an imaginary physical device in the virtual world. Examples of these specialized controllers are things like steering wheels and snowboard simulators for driving and sports applications, or magic wands for that virtualized MMORPG where you will be the mightiest wizard of them all.', ""We are already exploring new ways of interaction also here at Futurice's FutuLabs: using your hands with LeapMotion and Oculus Rift, and occasionally donning a pair of classic Reino slippers with controllers attached to get a more accurate full-body movement."", '', 'When I first used the Oculus Touch controllers, there was one particular moment that captured my attention. The way the physical controller maps your hands to their virtual counterparts fels surprisingly real and makes the virtual space feel that much more realistic. However, the illusion broke at the beginning of the Oculus Tutorial: I was supposed to lift my index finger and press down a virtual lid. That is exactly what I did, only to discover it feels very weird not having any sensation of actually touching the lid as my virtual hand pushed it.', 'Haptic feedback is still a little further ahead, but it is something we will crave and will ultimately use. Some companies like Teslasuit are going for a full-body suit, or less ambitious Hands Omni glove\xa0but this is not something mainstream users will do. The only way for this kind of approach to hit the mainstream usage in the future is as our normal clothes evolve towards more intelligent materials.', 'Prior to that, we‚Äôll be happy to start with simple tactile experiences. There is a range of different approaches which utilize different technologies. It does seem then that we won‚Äôt have any single solution soon, rather a range of different feedback systems suitable for different scenarios.', 'Ultrahaptics\xa0uses ultrasound to create a feeling of touch. Tactical Haptics, on the other hand, represents the simpler solution: adding haptic feedback to gaming controllers. We can expect this kind of feedback in most controllers in near future.', 'Virtual and augmented reality have come a long way from the earliest clumsy attempts. Now the technology, while still only showing a fraction of its potential, is finally mature enough for to hint at mainstream success.', 'Until now it has used many existing components such as mobile screens. Now we see a turn where VR and AR start to push and drive the development of some of these technologies instead of just utilizing existing solutions. Screen technology is a good example.', ""Mainstream adaptation of VR and AR will be stealthier and be centered around mobile usage over the next few years. The adoption of additional gadgets, such as glasses, depends on killer apps and their ability to blend in.

I think it‚Äôs here to stay, despite the fact that the technology is still in its infancy and will develop in leaps and bounds over the next few years. Here are a few educated guesses about where things are headed in the next 2-5 years.', 'In every field of modern technology, we strive to make things smaller. Augmented and virtual reality devices are no exception. In this realm, size matters even more than in most other areas ‚Äì mobile phones are a very handy size, but no amount of marketing videos will convince anyone that they‚Äôd be comfortable wearing Microsoft‚Äôs Hololens for a full workday.', 'There are two trends here: the high-end devices will still be clumsy for a few years. At the same time, more and more VR/AR applications will hit the low-end tech, a.k.a. high-end mobile devices. The clumsier and bigger devices will still have a role for a while though - especially in the industrial, business and gaming domains. Consumers, however, will not buy them until the devices, in essence, just disappear.', 'The word power can be understood in two ways: the raw computational power of the device\xa0or its energy consumption and battery life. The two are interlinked.', 'The capability of the computer running AR/VR applications not only has an impact on the demand for energy, but also on the size of the machine. Algorithms and the amount of calculation needed are still a big issue. Regardless of fancy sales videos, most applications still resort to rather crude graphics in order to save juice for the essentials, like a high frame rate. This means that even an affordable VR headset still requires a very powerful gaming engine that may cost several\xa0times the price of the actual device if you want to access to the most high-end experiences. Luckily, the prices are coming down as some VR-ready devices inch closer to the 1000 euro range.', 'Mainstream solutions need to\xa0run in existing consumer devices. Heavyweight VR can‚Äôt go mainstream if you need to buy too many expensive devices.\xa0The average consumer won‚Äôt buy a specialized VR headset, let alone an additional computer just to run VR. This limits the target market in heavyweight VR to gamers. One promising niche\xa0is the gaming consoles, where PS4 and Playstation VR have lead the way.', 'In addition to pushing more power into a smaller chip, manufacturers are working hard in an attempt to reduce computational complexity. Oculus‚Äô announcement last year of a new algorithm called Asynchronous Space Warp\xa0is one example. It means they only need to calculate frames at half the speed and can deduce the missing frames from that information. The solution demands considerably less power, allowing for a less expensive (and smaller) GPU and computer to power it up. However, as Oculus is quick to note, this is not an optimal solution and the best experience still lies in the 90Hz domain. Similar technology called Asynchronous Reprojection\xa0is now available now for HTC Vive.', 'Battery technology has been a big concern in the development of almost all new technology. It impacts the range of automated cars, storing renewable energy\xa0or just having your fancy mobile survive a single work day. Batteries are developing at much slower pace\xa0than everything else, so this will continue to be an issue. Portable AR requires power.\xa0Any method for reducing the need is welcome and adds to its usability.', 'Mapping space in the real world is one of the most critical features in augmented/mixed reality. Microsoft Hololens is the first high-end device to do this with any degree of accuracy. Even standard physic demos are pretty impressive: things fall and roll in a fairly credible way, and walls open and crack in just the right places when the aliens are coming to get you.', 'Space mapping will trickle to full VR, too, as the boundaries between the two start dissolving. We‚Äôll start using real-world props to augment the VR space to add to the immersion. Mixed reality as a term encompasses a wide variety of mixing the real and the virtual though the terminology is still somewhat vague.', 'Some devices like Facebook‚Äôs Santa Cruz portable VR prototype already include cameras to map the user‚Äôs surroundings. We are already using the room scale in high-end VR experiences -\xa0meaning that your movement in the (constrained) VR space is mapped one-to-one to your virtual world. This will be the default mode of operation for quite some time. It‚Äôs currently essential for limiting nausea and better linking the experience to the sensory experiences (balance, speed, position).', 'When we eventually get rid of\xa0physical limits like cords in VR, we‚Äôll need a way to verify the user is not bumping into walls, and can walk around in the real world, meaning we‚Äôll start including real world objects like chairs and generally mixing the real world into VR. For full immersion, the physical props mapped in VR might be needed long before VR headsets are standalone, freed from the server they\xa0now are connected to.', 'Augmented reality‚Äôs mainstream consumer applications will first appear on mobile devices. We‚Äôll want more information in a store or a museum. We‚Äôll use a lot of AR for entertainment. People don‚Äôt think twice of creating an anime or reindeer head with Meitu or Snapchat, and translating with Google Translate‚Äôs image replacement algorithm is becoming more commonplace.

Focus on value', '2. Take a holistic view', '3. Put safety first', '4. Consider the context', '5. Build a strong brand', '6. Prototype early and often', '7. Use data responsibly']","['In the near future, our everyday lives will be more and more filled with intelligent, connected objects. They will appear in our homes, in our working environments and in the cities we live in as well as travel with us everywhere we go in the form of wearables, smart clothing and things we cannot even imagine right now. This development is called the internet of things, IoT.', 'For designers focused on designing SW services and screen based interfaces or physical products, designing IoT solutions creates totally new design challenges. IoT solutions consist of multiple elements: physical devices like sensors, actuators and interactive devices, the network connecting these devices, the data gathered from these devices and analyzed to create a meaningful experience and last but definitely not least, the physical context in which user interacts with the solution. You need to do various types of design, from industrial product design to service and business design. All of these factors have their impact to the total UX of the IoT system and the task of designing in this context may feel quite overwhelming. To make it a little easier, I have gathered my list of the 7 most important design principles for IoT.', '', 'In the world of IoT, user research and service design are more crucial than ever. While early adopters are eager to try out new technology, many others are reluctant to take new technology into use and cautious about using it, due to not feeling confident with it. For your IoT solution to become widely adopted, you need to dig deep into users‚Äô needs in order to find out where lies a problem truly worth solving and what is the real end user value of the solution. You also need to understand what might be the barriers of adopting the new technology in general and your solution specifically. For deciding on your feature set, you need research too. The features that might be valuable and highly relevant for the tech early adopters may be uninteresting for the majority of the users and vice versa, so you need to plan carefully what features to include and in which order.', 'IoT solutions typically consist of multiple devices with different capabilities and both physical and digital touchpoints. The solution may also be provided in co-operation with multiple different service providers. It is not enough to design one of the touchpoints well, instead you need to take a holistic look across the whole system, the role of each device and service, and the conceptual model of how user understands and perceives the system. The whole system needs to work seamlessly together in order to create a meaningful experience.', 'As the IoT solutions are placed in the real world context, the consequences can be serious, when something goes wrong. At the same time the users of the IoT solutions may be vary of using new technology, so building trust should be one of your main design drivers. Trust is built slowly and lost easily, so you really need to make sure that every interaction with the product/service builds the trust rather than breaks it. What it means in practise? First of all, it means understanding possible error situations related to context of use, HW, SW and network as well as to user interactions and trying to prevent them. Secondly, if the error situations still occur, it means appropriately informing the user about them and helping them to recover. Secondly, it means considering data security & privacy as key elements of your design. It is really important for users to feel, that their private data is safe, their home, working environment and everyday objects cannot be hacked and their loved ones are not put at risk. Thirdly, quality assurance is critical and it should not only focus on testing the SW, but on testing the end to end system, in a real-world context.', 'IoT solutions exist at the crossroads of the physical and digital worlds. Commands given through digital interfaces may produce real world effects, but unlike digital commands, the actions happening in the real-world cannot necessarily be undone. In the real world context lots of unexpected things can happen and at the same time user should be able to feel safe and in control. The context places also other kind of requirements to the design. Depending on the physical context, the goal might be to minimize distraction of the user or e.g. to design devices that hold up against changing weather conditions. IoT solutions in homes, workplaces and public areas are are typically multi-user systems and thus less personal than e.g. screen based solutions used in smartphones, which also brings into picture the social context where the solution is used and its‚Äô requirements for the design.', 'Due to the real world context of the IoT solutions, regardless of how carefully you design things and aim to build trust, something unexpected will happen at some point and your solution is somehow going to fail. In this kind of situations, it is of utmost importance, that you have built a strong brand that truly resonates with the end users. When they feel connected to your brand, they will be more forgiving about the system failures and will still keep on using your solution. While designing your brand, you must keep in mind, that trust should be a key element of the brand, one of the core brand values. This core value should also be reflected in the rest of the brand elements, like the choice of color, tone of voice, imagery etc.', 'Typically HW and SW have quite different lifespans, but as successful IoT solution needs both the HW and SW elements, the lifespans should be aligned. At the same time, IoT solutions are hard to upgrade, because once the connected object is placed somewhere, it is not so easy to replace it with a newer version, especially if the user would need to pay for the upgrade and even the software within the connected object may be hard to update due to security and privacy reasons. Due to these factors and to avoid costly hardware iterations, it‚Äôs crucial to get the solution right, from the beginning of implementation. What this means from the design perspective is that prototyping and rapid iteration of both the HW and the whole solution are essential in the early stages of the project. New, more creative ways of prototyping and faking the solution are needed.', 'IoT solutions can easily generate tons of data. However, the idea is not to hoard as much data as possible, but instead to identify the data points that are needed to make the solution functional and useful. Still, the amount of data may be vast, so it‚Äôs necessary for the designer to understand the possibilities of data science and how to make sense of the data. Data science provides a lot of opportunities to reduce user friction, i.e. reducing use of time, energy and attention or diminishing stress. It can be used to automate repeated context dependent decisions, to interpret intent from incomplete/inadequate input or to filter meaningful signals from noise. Understanding what data is available and how it can be used to help the user is a key element in designing successful IoT services.', 'If you‚Äôd like to learn more, there are plenty of nice resources available as books and audiobooks. For some quick reading, I would recommend e.g. Iot Design Manifesto, 7 things to know when designing for the Internet of Things and Understanding the experience design of consumer IoT products.

The German export motor is roaring like never before. But the export-driven ""factory culture"" responsible for this success might as well be an impediment for the county\'s digital transformation. It puts IT in the center of a push-based value chain system and thus hinders implementing a pull strategy necessary for the success of digital products and services.', 'Manufacturing has been the backbone of the German industry since WWII and before. A ""Factory"" is probably one of the first picture that comes to mind when people around the world talk about German economy. A huge, technologically advanced and well organized factory that creates products of supreme quality. The image goes even beyond factories to factories for building factories: Tesla\'s search for a partner to build ""high-volume factories [that] allow us to manufacture high-quality products with economies of scale, making them more affordable and accessible to the world"" resulted in November 2016 in ""Tesla Grohmann Automation"".

Everything in these enterprises starts in ""The Factory"" where incredible work is being done on how to create a superb product that then takes its way through the rest of the organisation and its distribution network out to the customer.', 'Interestingly this manufacturing centricity also applies to quite a few non-manufacturing companies in Germany. Large insurance companies for example have adopted a similar approach. Financial and insurance products and services are created in the center, pushed out to the operational belt to be localized and pushed out again to the (rather cascaded) distribution network and finally to the consumer. The enterprise acts as if there was an actual physical factory responsible for creating ""German quality"" products.', 'With the advancements of information technologies, non-technology enterprises started creating digital services and digital complementary products. And they mostly used the same approach of core product manufacturing to create and deploy the new products and services. In the same manner insurance companies used an ""imaginary"" factory to manufacture their financial products, actual manufacturing companies established virtual ""IT factories"" that created high quality digital products.', 'The factory-centered approach was designed to serve an economy of scale and it very much succeeded in that. However it is today one of the main obstacles as these enterprises are trying to conquer economies of speed and survive disruption of their business model.

Those business departments are responsible for utilizing the new technologies to create new digital products and services and push them out to the semi-independent operation/sales entities around the globe.

New market entrants erode profit, competitors seem to be always moving ahead, all while customers seek higher quality and cheaper sources of service.', 'The pace and appetite for change is exhausting. Yet comparatively, it feels like your organization is sinking deeper into the mud. ‚ÄúWe want to change but the culture here is too difficult to change‚Äù. It‚Äôs a frequent remark we have all heard and said but what does it mean?', 'Culture is the original business meme. Its meaning and usage are as abstract and intangible as the word itself. ‚ÄúIf we just fix the culture we will be successful‚Äù. A statement full of positive intent yet lacking a clear directive or step to take.', 'A new culture is not a browser plugin. Leaders cannot simply select an extension, download and install it from the Web. Nor should, leaders expect the update to be applied only to others and not to themselves.', 'The prevailing thinking is the need to change people‚Äôs mindset. The belief being if we tell people to think differently, they will act differently. All hands meetings are called, PowerPoint decks are prepped and an executive tour is scheduled to rally the troops for the mission ahead. A one, maybe two day training session is delivered and the metamorphosis begins. But it does not.', 'Culture is our behaviors. It is the actions we perform. The way we talk, and treat one another. The way we behave reflects the values and expectations we have of ourselves, and of one another.', 'The single most important action of any leader is to role model the behaviors they wish to see others exhibit in the organization.', 'Culture change does not lead with words, it leads with action. By changing the way we behave, our actions begin to change the way we observe, experience and eventually see the world. By seeing and experiencing the world differently, it changes the way we think about the world. People do not change their mental model of the world by speaking about it, they need to experience the change to believe and feel it.', 'John Shook was the first American manager to be hired by Toyota. He moved to Japan without knowing a word of Japanese, just a desire to immerse himself in the organization for a prolonged period of time to learn the Toyota Production System by doing it.', 'What he observed was not a group of managers telling people what to think, or how to perform their work. Instead he experienced the deliberate practice of experimentation, reflection and improvement by all employees in the entire organization. Toyota had developed a set of behaviours that advocated continuous learning and adaptation to new circumstances.', 'What Toyota understood is that culture and circumstance is always unique and changing, and to manage change one has to be ready to learn, adapt, and apply new changes as they are happening.', 'Shook‚Äôs model highlighted that transformation starts from our behavior. Therefore, to start changing culture we need to change how people do their work.', 'In our experience a very effective first step for a major transformation is to start with a set of hand-picked initiatives that do things differently. We did this together with the engine manufacturing company W√§rtsil√§. W√§rtsil√§ is over a century old manufacturing company that serves roughly half the ships in the world and has five billion dollar revenues ‚Äì not a typical Silicon Valley startup.', 'To kickstart the transformation, leadership provided sponsorship and support to four cross-function teams to explore new ideas and ways of working. The purpose of these teams was to bump into and make visible the cultural glass walls that so often had stalled and hindered other initiatives.', 'Rather than have the four teams take courses or workshop ideas, the underlying idea was to have four teams experience a new way of working for real. This was ensured by selecting the top strategic innovation initiatives for the teams focus on.', 'The second step was to create an environment to cultivate the new ways of working. In other words, we made the workspace inspiring, different, and importantly, we let the team personalize it to make it their own. We provided guidance, tools and innovation frameworks for the people to leverage.', 'By embracing Shook‚Äôs philosophy, it was extremely important that the teams had a mandate to work differently and to really experiment with new ways of working, new behaviour. The mandate created a psychological safety net for them. Failure is expected when working creatively and trying out new ideas, and therefore, it was critical to enable safe failure and learning opportunities.', 'To further facilitate the cultural transformation, the teams broadcasted their intermediate results in demo sessions to the whole company. This turned out to be both popular and effective in further spreading the transformation by showing concrete results rather than talk of trying things differently.', 'Throughout the eight week program the teams fully experienced working in new, interesting and unforeseen ways. Rather than just reading a book or taking a course on lean, agile and design thinking the teams had to apply the new methods and mindset while creating meaningful outcomes for the business. For the individuals participating in the program it was an extremely effective way to safely learn new ways of working, and perhaps more importantly, to learn the limitations of the former company culture.', 'What did we learn from running this, and similar programs?', 'First, jump-starting the cultural transformation with a couple of spearhead projects, the right people and leadership support is very effective. The projects will demonstrate that the company‚Äôs own people can achieve the desired results and business outcomes with new ways of working.', 'Second, the people who have experienced new ways of doing are transformed. Applying the new behavior into real projects transforms their thinking about innovation and the whole company, which makes them the key people in spreading the new culture.', 'Finally, choosing the people to the spearhead projects is critical as those people will become the ambassadors for a bigger cultural change in the organization. They will tell the stories others will listen. They will introduce the new ways of working to others, as they are the people who know best how the new thinking applies to your company. They are the first penguins to dive into the cold water, swim and survive.', 'However, none of this matters if you, the leader of change, don‚Äôt change as well. As the leader of this change you are penguin number zero: the very first person who has to change your behavior. You need to be transparent about your vision, words, and actions. You need to work according to the new culture you wish to see.', 'P.S. To hear more stories of the W√§rtsil√§ culture change, have a look at the videos here.']",[]

To achieve that, RxJava had to be rewritten from the ground up.', 'Reactive Streams provides a common understanding and API of how a reactive library should work.', 'The majority of us do not write reactive libraries, but the benefit that it brings us is the ability to use different reactive libraries together.', 'An example is Reactor 3 library, which is quite similar to RxJava.

That means, for the time being, that your ROI of using RxJava 2 for Reactive Streams is quite low.', 'In RxJava 2 there is a new reactive type, Flowable, which is very similar to Observable from RxJava 1, but with a key difference; in RxJava 2, Flowable is the type that supports backpressure.', 'Let‚Äôs clarify what ‚Äúsupport backpressure‚Äù means.', 'People who are new to RxJava 2 often hear ‚ÄúFlowable supports backpressure‚Äù and ask, ‚ÄúDoes backpressure support mean that I will never have MissingBackpressureException?‚Äù.

This means that they will never emit MissingBackpressureException. In case the consumer is not able to immediately process events, they will be buffered and replayed later.', 'So when should you use Flowable and when should you use Observable?', 'I use Flowable when backpressure issues are particularly likely to occur and if not handled correctly could lead to issues. In the case of the accelerometer, I would still use Flowable - if I took my sweet time with the readings than just printing them, backpressure would occur.', 'Observable should be used when the issue is not likely. If the user clicks some button a few times too many, we can live with them being buffered.', 'One word of caution, if you would use Observable in a place where a massive amount of events are buffered, the entire application will crash.', 'My rule of thumb would be when creating an Observable, think if the source of events behaves like:', 'Remember that even if you take really long time to process button click, you will get backpressure issues!', 'The performance of RxJava 2 is better than in the previous version.', 'Having more performant library is always a nice thing.

So to put it briefly, blockchain is a database for platforms that evolve through their use rather than through a single point of control.', 'Ethereum is a very interesting experiment, and in my opinion was the first interesting open application of blockchain since the start of Bitcoin. The main difference to Bitcoin is that it allows more complicated smart contracts, a term originally coined by computer scientist Nick Szabo, that can be used to add more complex logic to the blockchain instead of just using it as a huge distributed database. Ethereum also implements new methods that aim to reduce the transaction time compared to Bitcoin to make it more usable in real-world applications, and seems to use more of a trial and error method to problem solving, which allows it to move fast.', 'However, the design decisions made in Ethereum come with a price. The complexity of having a generic programming language for smart contracts has resulted in attacks that try to slow down the system up to the point of it being unusable, which in turn has forced the community to do several bugfix revisions to the base technology. In a blockchain the history cannot be modified, each bugfix results in basically splitting the blockchain in two incompatible parts, which is not desirable since it breaks interoperability with old clients. Also the faster transaction times inevitably lead to larger challenges in scalability when the total amount of data grows faster.', 'Taking all of this into account I still think Ethereum is a nice platform for experimenting with blockchains and smart contracts right now and this is the main reason we chose Ethereum as the basis of our experiment as well. And I kind of like the fact that it gives credit to the blockchain pioneers through naming its basic units (wei, szabo, finney) after the key people in the early days of blockchain technology: Wei Dai, Nick Szabo and Hal Finney. But because of the aforementioned technical issues I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for large scale mission critical deployments, it was released just over 18 months ago and no one knows where it will be three years from now on.', 'First of all the term smart contract is somewhat misleading, since smart contracts are code just like every other piece of software out there. The idea is that current legal contracts are often vague and hard to interpret, so we should write our contracts in code instead and let the code have absolute control over all transactions, therefore saving lots of money in both interpreting contracts and resolving contractual disputes. However, contracts always involve people one way or another, and contracts between people are governed by the contract law of each country which defines what kinds of contracts can be considered legally binding. From a legal perspective contracts should be always interpreted in the existing legal framework, which makes handing absolute control to the code somewhat impossible in real life.', 'If we ignore the misleading name for smart contracts and simply consider them as distributed business logic, there are as many meaningful uses for smart contracts as there there are for blockchains. To put it simply, if blockchain is a database without a single point of control, smart contract is an application programming interface controlling the modification of that data.', 'This includes, but is not limited to, basic user access control and locking data to prevent further modifications.', 'There is no simple answer to this, but if I had to answer shortly I would say yes it will most likely disrupt businesses, but not across the board. Personally I like to compare blockchain technology and the whole movement around it to the free software movement.', 'Back in the early days software was written largely by hackers and academics in an open manner, but as time went by more and more people started to do business writing software and wanted to have more control in how their software was used. By the 80s closed source software was the norm and open source more of an exception, but as the availability of computers grew so did the amount of people doing programming and the people being tired of reinventing the wheel and being restricted by others. This lead to the rise of the free software movement, which similar to the blockchain community had its ideological basis in classical liberalism and to some extent in individualist anarchism through the connections to the hacker culture. That all brought us to where we are now with Linux and related software running huge parts of our infrastructure and our mobile phones. The main reason for this has been that software has become more or less a commodity and the focus has shifted from owning software to using software and owning information.', 'I think whatever open source has done to the software industry, blockchain technology has a chance to do it to big data. But just like open source, open data is not suitable for every business model. If businesses are willing to give away control of some of their data and let others build on it, there is a chance of accelerated growth in data intensive fields and therefore more and bigger business opportunities as well. Just think of how for example Wikipedia has reduced the need for encyclopedias, but at the same time significantly accelerated growth by giving more people access to more information and letting users not only consume but also produce new content.', 'Naturally in cases where giving away control is not acceptable it is also possible to create private blockchains with no third party involvement whatsoever, but that would reduce the blockchain to a simple fault tolerant distributed database, which is hardly disrupting and quite unlikely the most suitable technology for the job. The potential power of a blockchain based system comes from using it for one thing, but at the same time maintaining a platform that allows other applications for the data as well. If we can efficiently utilise this potential or not remains to be seen.', '![](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)', 'This blog post, including both the text and images, but not the linked documents or web content, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Companies don‚Äôt necessarily have the internal resources to help them to do this or the time or budgets to hire external resource.', 'Crowdsourcing allows businesses to use the input of a much wider group of people than their own R&D or innovation experts such as all employees, customers, students, to help address some or all of the issues raised by digital disruption. Diverse individuals from outside the business can bring varied skills, backgrounds and perspectives to address a company‚Äôs needs in completely new and fresh ways. Companies can ask crowds to find solutions to specific problems or to figure out what kind of problems can be solved within certain contexts. Crowdsourcing innovation is also very closely connected with open innovation and co-creation. While it has many advantages, crowdsourcing also brings risks that need to be addressed.', 'I had the privilege of hosting Business Value Exchange‚Äôs Twitter Chat session: Crowdsourcing: a Risky Road to Innovation?, to discuss some of the issues around crowdsourcing innovation:', 'The session was structured around three main questions:', '1. What are the applications of crowdsourcing? e.g. sourcing innovation/R&D', 'There are many different applications of crowdsourcing innovation such as hackathons to build prototypes within a defined context. A slightly different method is to use an open API approach which allows others to build new services and products on top of a company‚Äôs own service in order to extend the core offering. Meanwhile co-creation is one type of crowdsourcing where customers are part of the innovation process.', 'Crowds can be used for different kinds of problem solving whether it is a specific problem looking for a solution or whether companies are seeking new ideas on ways to add value to their customers for example. As a general point, crowdsourcing is useful for companies seeking help in executing ideas especiallly when the crowds concerned are groups of expert developers, data scientists or designers. After all, ideas on their own aren‚Äôt especially valuable.', '2. What is the collateral of crowdsourcing? (Iterative prototyping of ideas, crowd feedback)', 'The experimental nature of crowdsourcing means that there is an element of surprise in terms of what it will deliver. When it comes to the additional unforeseen advantages of crowdsourcing, these can range from obtaining new market insights into your sector, generating business leads, discovering new talent you can hire, to softer wins such as building a sense of community around a product or service or sharing responsibility for a big decision (the wisdom of the crowds).', '3. What are the risks, for example losing control of IP?', 'Like most approaches, crowdsourcing also has tradeoffs that need to be addressed. Naturally due to the nature of crowdsourcing, there isn‚Äôt the same degree of confidentiality that is typical of inhouse R&D. In addition, companies are likely to struggle to protect their own IP.', 'Crowdsourcing can also involve reputational risk to companies in cases where inventors don‚Äôt feel they have been compensated fairly for their efforts. Meanwhile, the diverse nature of crowdsourcing can also cause challenges for companies wanting to ensure the work is aligned to particular targets or to other internal projects.', 'Crowdsourcing and especially an open API approach, also carries the risk that competitors may\xa0piggyback the company‚Äôs original service in order to win users and customers and then try to overshadow the original service with their own.', 'Ultimately any group approach to problem solving comes with challenges. Crowdsourcing has its strengths and weaknesses and comes with trade-offs which have to be thought through and managed in advance. In the end though, crowds expand the capabilities of companies and so they should be viewed as another tool for organizational problem solving.']",[]

These tools are geared towards UX designers, service designers and visual designers, all people in the business of crafting solutions for digital services. This scoping will leave out apps, physical touchpoint, and some marketing tools, e.g. email tracking. All of these tools also rely on passive tracking (from the user perspective).', 'In brief, I will cover Descriptive behavioral analytics, Heat maps , Experiment management , Screen recordings, and Design variation generation & testing as distinct categories of tools.', 'This post focuses on established web design tools. It is clear that cutting edge work may call for novel tools that may recall custom data collection and analysis tools. Considering the wealth of data, this likely calls support from a data scientist.', 'Data-driven design is well compatible with evidence-based design approaches. For instances, Lean UX is one philosophy of digital design preaching that all designs should have a clear underlying hypothesis that the design tests out. This perfectly fine, but as I see it, the use of data-driven design tools can be either confirmatory (hypothesis-driven) or exploratory. In fact, I believe both approaches will likely be needed even though the former is much preferred.', 'I have discovered that exploration of user behavior becomes more important the more complicated the service is (or shorter the history of systematic design is). The more choice and opportunities the interface affords, the more likely it is that users will appropriate it to their own liking. They will come up with use cases and patterns that reveal new opportunities for service and interface design - something designers cannot anticipate or predict to happen!', 'Available tools do not fall into easily distinguishable categories. To clarify things, I have chosen to focus on publicly available tools for web services and hybrid applications that utilize passive tracking.', 'Many of these tools I discuss are also known as web analytics solutions, but many recent services have opted for growth or optimization related tag lines instead of ‚Äúanalytics‚Äù. Despite the label, they are all fit for use in data-driven design.', 'I will highlight five distinct categories of tools available for passive data collection in the order of decreasing usefulness:', 'One important difference between different types of tools concerns whether they (primarily) provide answers to user thinking and behavior in terms of\xa0why\xa0or what. You could relate to this as a difference akin\xa0to qualitative and quantitative, or thick and big data. The important thing is that the perspectives are complementary and often times you as a designer must descend from what to why in order to vision how to advance your designs further.', ""In the following depictions,\xa0I have included some illustrations and videos, but I suggest you also visit the linked sites to get producers'\xa0pitch on the potency of their solutions. Most of the toosl are \xa0available for testing, often even for free."", 'Besides the effort related to getting started, I recommend that you talk with your development team in advance to estimate the technical performance impact of each solution. Usually having one or two scripts in production will not create \xa0much overhead, but it is not advisable to stack all possible tools to your real website at once just for trying them out - eventually they will slow down your site and work against your efforts.', 'Remote usability tests have pioneered the capture of full user interactions with digital services. This first happened in real-time (i.e. synchronously) when the technology simply connected one screen with another. But then someone (that is, ClickTale, userfly, and Mouseflow.com) miraculously realized that the user sessions, with views, clicks and all, could be recorded and stored as videos for viewing later on (asynchronously)!', 'Session replays offered through screen recordings provide a very detailed view into user activities and even intentions.

This has greatly built my understanding of why the numbers describing the experimental outcomes turn out the way they do. For instance, you may have witness conflicting performance indicators such as improved conversion rate for purchases despite increased transaction time. Screen recording might reveal that instead of streamlining, your new design makes it easier for user to try out different shipping and billing option combinations, therefore taking more to purchase.', 'Currently at least Crazy Egg, ClickTale, Mouseflow, Inspectlet, Lucky Orange, and HotJar offer this type of service. Read more about their difference and pricing from UI Patterns review.', 'Getting started:', 'The screen recording setup require some initial development effort. From there on, designers will have it pretty nice from there one, being able to initiate recordings themselves. The biggest concern in screen recordings is privacy. The screen recordings present a new level intrusion that can make even the designer feel uncomfortable as disclosure of personal details can sometimes be unavoidable.', 'Heat maps are one of the most popular techniques to quickly and simply reveal how user interact with a single view (typically a page). They display the amount of clicks users make on a website, as well as how much users scroll down from the initial view (scroll depth ). CrazyEgg, Clicktale, Hotjar, and SumoMe are the best known examples of this approach.', 'Any scientist would be dumbstruck if I told you that eyeballing is not only the most popular, but nearly the ONLY available analysis method for heat maps. At best, you can compare two maps with one another. Practice and experience help in interpreting the maps, but this shortcoming is evident.', 'The insights that you deduce from heatmaps are two fold:', 'Becoming aware of the scroll depth helps to explain the distribution of the clicks. It is evident that nobody will click on targets they do not perceive‚Ä¶ For design insight, the concentration of click attempts may help to discover potential area for UI elements.', 'Video about Hotjar shows both heatmaps and user screen recordings made with the tool.', 'Getting started:', 'Heat maps are quite designer friendly tools. Designer can configure and utilize heat map tools well alone once the initial web server configuration is in place.', 'Experiment management enable running different type of experiments on digital services. Most famous of them all, AB or ABX tests that pit multiple design variations against one another. AB refers to a simple comparison of two designs (one of them usually being the old, control version), whereas ABX (aka. Bucket or multivariate) test includes several variations, sometimes in multiple dimensions. For instance, if you only change colors on ecommerce website you could call it AB, if you have two color variations and a layout change, that would be a multivariate test.', 'Experiment management solutions make experiments possible. The content of the experiment itself, as well as figuring out the right question for study, is up to the designer and usually requires a different set of tools.', 'Getting started:', 'In web use, these solutions tools such as Optimizely and Visual Website Optimizer are quite comprehensive. They require some configuration also in the server side for flexible experiments so a designer is unlikely to manage them alone. Often they can‚Äôt be even implemented using a tag management solution such as Google Tag Manager. Then again, once running many of tools offer WYSIWYG type of editing opportunities that allow designers to configure experiments comparing different UI designs. But if major changes in services are needed, this is not going to be enough.', 'My previous post\xa0 on the fundamentals of data-driven design tools noted that there are hardly any generative tools that would allow designers to create new designs based on. I admit I was bit fooling you. There are certain tools that allow to generate new design proposals based on both designer and user input data. They only tend to be very specific.', 'For example, Optimal Products Ltd. has released products called Optimal Sort and Treejack, which attempt to facilitate the generation of hierarchical menus. Regardless of what you may think about the progressiveness of this menu concept, these tools are made to assist finding optimal structure for a number of menu items; or even assess the need for certain items. In combination they allow for both creating new designs based on user performance on menu traversal tasks.', 'Optimal Sort is a variation of an old usability method card sorting that has been used to generate menu structures that are intuitive for each user. The beauty of this tool is the automated analysis of user patterns and removal of the human usability tester from the equation. This is a great example of the additional power the new breed of tools can hand to designers.', 'Many designers have been taking the advantage of rapid UI prototyping tools such as InVision or Sketch to get feedback about their designs. These approaches would also fall under this category of tools, although I do not associate them with passive tracking type of data-driven design tools as they lack automated collection, aggregation and analytics features.', 'Getting started:', 'The tools from Optimal workshop, for instance, are stand alone SaaS products. They require some skilled setup work for which reason independent designers may need external help to run the tests. However, in a longer run, acquiring the skills is not that difficult and tests can well be conducted on their own.', 'Descriptive Behavioral Analytics are the foundation of all current data-driven design solutions. They have been around for pretty as long as the first web server was running. These services collect data about user interactions with a web service, along with all contextual data related to the visit, and aggregate it for reporting. They commonly produce metrics such number of users, visits/sessions, pageviews, traffic sources and so forth. The outcome can usually be simply summarized as two dimensional table or a time-series diagram.', 'While these type of tools have been generally adequate for marketing and business purposes, they tend to be less actionable from the design perspective. They can be more useful if you combine them with any of the other tools I‚Äôve enlisted this far.', 'Behavioral analytics can be collected through two channels: server or client-based. In the former case, the web server which handles the content also collects so called click stream data. In the more popular case of client-based collection the user‚Äôs web browser sends the (with the previously mentioned potential handicap of being blocked by an ad blocker or similar). These two approaches can also be combined. Either way, some server configuration by a coding competent perosn is needed before any data is available for reporting.', 'In my work, I‚Äôve found that the most useful descriptive statistics are those that describe the current audience of a digital services. After all, audience is something that every new service is dying to discover! For UI design, knowing the basic situation about user device categories (mobile vs. desktop), screen resolution and operating system/browser version can make all the difference for attempts to optimize UX.', 'Because descriptive analytics solutions, like Adobe Analytics, offer much more data than any designer can bear at a time, it has become common to pile it on top of a dashboard. I personally believe that dashboards have limited value in everyday design work, with the exception of experiments should they be running fast. Design insights, unlike business KPIs, should not change over night whatever happens in the competitive environment.', 'I do think some metrics are so important that is good to keep them in sight - and why not on a dashboard! The most recent design and development dashboard I‚Äôve created included many of the aforementioned audience characteristics, as well vital signs of the ecommerce business (revenue, conversion rate), landing pages and service errors. However, much of this information was geared for the developers involved with the everyday operation.', 'Getting started:', 'Installing GA, Adobe, Kissmetrics or similar client-based tracking solution requires a tracking code on the web server. The aforementioned tag (tag = tracking code) management solutions may help to pass on the power to try new tools to designers as well. Configuration of server-based solutions is going to be more tricky. The good part is there are lot of free services so experimenting costs only time.', 'Things are not so clear cut with these tools. Real world tools available for designers combine several features or categories of tools. After you‚Äôve picked the tool, you will likely need to decide on the appropriate subscription as few services afford real work for free. Most tools are affordable at maximum couple thousand a year, although in some cases the premium come very an extremely hefty price tag (over $120K/annum for Google Analytics 360, former Premium).', 'The development of data tools for web services has taken the path that most analytics solutions have become packed with overlapping features. For instance, probably the most widely used web analytics tool, Google Analytics, combines numerous features. It includes not only aggregate descriptive statistics of user behavior and technology, but also views into individual users and individual page heat maps. And since Google incorporated an Experiments feature into it, it also enables running AB-tests!', 'This is quite radical. To have both massive aggregate (and sampled) together with detailed individual level is like a dream come true. However, most of the time it is still a dream and in reality you will need separate tools to capture both ends of the spectrum - the big and the small.\xa0However, GA is not really an integrated solution yet even though it does offer multiple kinds of views into customer behavior, such as the User Explorer tool.', 'User Explorer in Google Analytics provides a crude view into user flow.

It's not a codified religion with rituals and artefacts. Goals pursued can range from animal welfare to economic growth. What makes it stand out from may existing traditions of using data in design are the tools it employs, as well as the human factor."", 'Unlike other pursuits where data is exploited, such as\xa0landscape architecture or Formula 1, digital services have a unique relationship to the data source. Users of digital services generate the data dynamically and sometimes proactively (generate and respond). They must be a part of the ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù equation in an emphatic way.', ""When successful, data-driven design provides insights that lead to successful re-designs and faster design evolution. The insights may highlight the human factors in an unpredictable manner. Christian Rudder‚Äôs data on dating (OKCupid.com) is a great example. He found three different stories for what men's preferences are as far as the age of the women they wish to date:"", 'This is real-world data, people. Inconclusive, incoherent, big\xa0and beautiful. Making the best out of it is a design challenge and luckily these days we have access to many\xa0tools that allow designers to learn quickly and more than ever before!', 'The way I see it, data-driven design is grounded in ‚Äúbig‚Äù data collected through the novel techniques of behavioral tracking and sensing, whether in virtual environments (such as web browsing behavior) or with physical devices (mobile device use patterns).', ""It's ‚Äúbig‚Äù, because the data is not necessarily big by the standards of a 2016 digital footprint. It is big in comparison to what design research (even market research) has been capable of\xa0collecting and utilizing\xa0in the past. It also emerges in interaction and the data is often unique to the situation of both the digital service and the user. I call this the Internet of People (IoP), just to highlight the difference to the emerging Internet of Things data stream."", 'The stream of IoP data is in constant flux. Unlike with machinery, human responses with respect to your digital offering will vary from day to day as users constantly adapt to the ever-changing network.', 'The data-driven design approach places an emphasis on data\xa0quantity. Designers, however, must never forget the qualitative insights. Qualitative data provides an understanding that is a necessary condition for design as long humans run the show (Pavlichuck on big and thick data). Design decisions and inspiration for new proposals should be derived from data, so\xa0a good label for this approach might as well be data-informed design. The aim of my approach\xa0is to preserve the\xa0agency of design with human designers ‚Äì not algorithms.', '‚Äúpreserve the\xa0agency of design with human designers', 'This article provides\xa0an outline of the variety of tools that can be utilized in data-driven design.

I will also give a few concrete examples of tools that are currently popular in designing web-based services.', 'While I\xa0personally advocate for the unique greatness of the (digital big) data-driven design approach, most methods I promote are not new to designers and design researchers.

Passive tracking vs. active elicitation is the difference between covertly recording aspects of user actions and characteristics, while active elicitation poses questions\xa0about the service to the user,\xa0directly (surveys) or indirectly (chats). Passive tracking tools usually solve the challenges of \xa0automated collection, aggregation and analysis all in one."", 'Especially passive tracking in particular has generated\xa0much discussion over the years.

In practice, I have\xa0been doing my best to help thesis writers to overcome unnecessary obstacles. I say unnecessary because thesis writing should be inspiring, fun, exciting, and very, very useful for your future career (even if you never become an academic).', ""Here's what I have learned as an instructor:"", ""Do not let the thesis become more important than it is. Yes, the thesis is one of the highlights of your studies, but it is only one part of your studies. The point of a thesis is to demonstrate that you can tackle an interesting topic in an academic manner, i.e., you can do research. It won't define who you are, it won't define your career, and no one has ever won a Nobel prize based on their thesis. Put the thesis into context and take a more relaxed attitude towards it. The result is that\xa0your writing\xa0becomes\xa0easier,\xa0faster, and better. It is only a thesis. Sit down and just do\xa0it!"", 'Well... no. The point of a thesis is to show you can do research and document it in writing. If your research question, methodology, and positioning are well done, the results are not that important. Especially if you analytically discuss the results and show that you understand why the results are what they are. No one is expecting a thesis worker to come up with a ground breaking scientific contribution, so take it easy.', ""The literature study in your thesis should not be a boring list of references you dug up from Google Scholar. The literature, i.e., other people's work, should be part of your narrative. You should position your work in relation to other work. Think of it as a large puzzle where other people's work\xa0form 99% of the puzzle pieces, and the last piece is this thesis of yours. Your job is to describe the picture that the whole puzzle forms (the broad topic of academic research) and then you describe the major existing pieces of this puzzle (academic literature, previous work, existing software, standards, patents...) and then explain how your thesis is a missing piece that helps form the bigger picture (it is probably a small piece, but a missing piece nevertheless)."", 'What is the easiest way to write really boring text? Write it for no one in particular. Boring text creates a bad thesis. More importantly, it\xa0makes it harder for you to understand what is relevant and what is not. Therefore, define an audience and state it in your thesis. Are you writing for fellow software engineers? Are you writing for people who are experts in one field but not in the one you are researching? Is your audience academic or business people? Once you have an audience in your mind, put yourself in their position and think what would they want to know. This will be your guiding light throughout your writing: what is my audience going to do with this piece of information? NOTE! In practice, you have an audience of one: your professor is probably the only person on this planet who will read your thesis. Therefore, it is very important to know what your professor is looking for in a good thesis and what research and literature s/he thinks is relevant.', 'Great, now you have an idea what pitfalls to avoid. But how to write a great thesis?', ""I believe in\xa0a crystal clear structure in a thesis. Why? Because most people do not read a thesis like a detective novel: in a linear way from page 1 to the last page. Observe yourself picking up someone's thesis. Most probably you start looking for the abstract or thesis statement to see whether the work\xa0is of any interest to you. Then you jump into results. Then you might skim over the methodology to figure out whether you believe in the results, and then you jump to the list of references to see whether they cite the work you are familiar with."", 'My point is that everyone who ever picks up your thesis will read it in a non-linear way. Therefore, the structure and the table of contents are very important for the reader to be able to jump back and forth and to figure out with minimal\xa0effort\xa0the gist and quality of your research.', 'There is another reason for having a clear structure. Academic work is all about making the research process clear and transparent so that your findings can be scrutinised and the scientific community can believe in your work. It is the core of the ""scientific method"", to document one\'s research in a way that other scientists can understand how you came up with your results and build on top of them. A great thesis has a clear structure because it demonstrates to your professor that you understand this fundamental point of scientific work. In other words, you can do academic writing.', 'In the core of your thesis you have a triangle of three key things: the research question (RQ), the research method (ME) and the research results (RE). The RQ defines the ME which produces the RE which answers the RQ. In other words, you ask a research question (the missing piece of the puzzle), and to answer that question you choose certain methods, and those methods obviously produce some results, which are the answers to the original research question. Yes, it is as simple as that.', 'The three parts are, of course, interconnected. So if you change your method, you better check whether you are still answering the research question and whether you are still producing the results you are looking for. I always recommend people to write down their first draft of these three components on the very first day of writing. Writing a thesis is very much about iterating these three components and tweaking them into a neat academic package.', '\nThe core triangle of any thesis: Research Question, MEthodology, and REsuts.', 'What about the Introduction, Literature and Discussion parts of my thesis?', ""The Introduction section of your thesis is where you paint the big picture and connect your work into the bigger questions and issues out there. The literature section is where you position your work (see above), and the discussion section is where you take your results and connect them back to the big issues you described in the Introduction. Let's use the puzzle metaphor again. The Introduction is looking at the big picture of the puzzle with 99% of the pieces in place. The literature section is describing the most important pieces of the puzzle and the ones surrounding the missing piece. Your RQ is framing the missing piece, your ME is describing how you will fill that hole, and your RE is the final missing piece. Then your discussion section at the end of the thesis is stepping back and looking at the big picture of the puzzle now with your little piece in it."", ""Let's take everything I mentioned above and turn it into the first pages of your thesis and the first version of your thesis format. Open your text editor. Write the following section headers:"", 'Next, take each section, and underneath the header, write in bullet points 3-5 things you will write about under that section.', 'Next, see whether there are some obvious sub-sections. For example,', '1. Introduction1.1 The effects of climate change1.2 Rising number of cyclists in European cities', 'For each sub-section, write 3-5 bullet points that describe what should be discussed under the sub-header.', 'Now you have a skeleton of a thesis that will help you address the writing piecemeal. You can choose small parts here and there to work on, and you will have a good structure to keep the parts together to form the whole thesis. Every now and then revise the whole super structure to make it balanced and to support your work. For example, many students decide that a the research question is a sub-section under the Introduction (e.g., 1.3. Research Question). Some writers feel more comfortable having the literature part also as a sub-section of the Introduction.', ""Don't forget to check with your professor whether they agree with the structure you have. For example, some professors require a Conclusions section in the thesis, and some disciplines of research typically separate the analysis of results from the actual Results section."", 'My last tip to you is a set of sparring questions for each top header.', 'Why is this research important? Is there a bigger phenomenon that this research of yours is part of? Why people in your profession should care about this thesis?', 'What has been done related to this (mainly in academic publications)? What do the authors say about the topic? How does your research question relate to these previous studies? How do you apply them or add to them? Based on what they say, what do you say? (Tip: find an actual researcher that has studied your field and ask her/him for relevant literature. You save weeks of work once you find an expert).', 'Based on what other people have studied before, what is the question that no one has really answered yet? What is the main question, and what are perhaps the two or three sub-questions that you need to answer to be able to answer the main question? Look twice what you write in your RQ, because you will have to answer these questions :)', 'How do you find an answer to the research question? How do you gather data? From where do you gather data? How do you analyze the data? Out of all the methods in the world, why did you choose this one? What is good about it and what is not? What were the alternative methods, and what were their pros and cons?', 'What is the answer to the research question? What are the answers to the sub-questions? Keep this simple and clear.', 'How could someone criticize your results? Are they internally valid (the data was gathered and analyzed correctly)? Are the results externally valid (can they be generalized and how)? Based on the results, what can you say about the bigger picture you described in your introduction? How could someone apply your results for further research? Or perhaps apply in a non-research context (e.g., in a company or in everyday life)?', 'Take each section at a time and one question at a time and answer them in bullet points. Suddenly you have several pages of your thesis ready. Then turn the bullet points into actual text that is easy to read (remember to keep your audience in mind). And that is how you climb the thesis mountain one step at a time.', 'Let me know if you found this blog post useful and if you have suggestions or other comments.\xa0I hope these tips and points help you get your thesis done and over with, so that you to focus on (perhaps) the more important things in life :)']","['Introduction', 'Literature', 'Research Question', 'Methodology', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'References']"

The collected data is sent to a phone or a laptop with Bluegiga Bluetooth breakout board.', 'An early plan was to embed flex sensors in the clothing around joints locations and back to measure postures. Unfortunately the flex sensors turned out to be too rigid to adapt to different postures. They folded in wrong ways thus giving false signals. Therefore the team shifted to using conductive rubber cord which changes resistance when stretched. The rubber cord conforms to body movements better as it is not rigid like a flex sensor. Conductive thread woven into the clothing connects the rubber cords to the microcontroller.', 'Other types of sensors were evaluated during the project as well. One of the interesting ideas was to use EMG (electromyography, muscle sensor) to measure muscle tension, for example in the shoulder and neck areas.

However, we consider this to be worse for a few reasons. First, it requires putting platform credentials inside the mobile apps, which is potentially a security issue. Second, it ties a mobile app to a specific push notifications service, and changing the service would require updating the app for all users. Third, large parts of the implementation need to be redone multiple times, once for each platform (Android, iOS etc.).

Thus it is more convenient to just pass through all the options, instead of trying to codify those to a custom format common to all the platforms.', 'Future development will mainly consist of maintenance, and probably adding some convenience APIs for common operations. It will not consist of adding every possible customization, option, and feature.

Mobile apps can subscribe, unsubscribe, register and deregister, and fetch some generic information. An admin can publish push notifications, and add and delete topics.', 'The service is stateless. All client information and subscriptions are stored only in SNS. Scaling becomes straightforward and it does not matter whether some other service is making changes to SNS at the same time, as this service will just use whatever is in SNS.', 'The API provides common functionality out-of-the-box. For example, we have noticed a common use case where a mobile app needs to register for push notifications and subscribe to predefined topics. The device registration endpoint does exactly that.', 'There are no direct connections to any push notification services (such as APNS for Apple and GCM for Google).

The feature increases text input speed especially on mobile devices because one doesn't have to type every letter in a word. Autocomplete functionality is commonly found on search engines and messaging apps."", 'An autocompleter can only suggest words that it knows about. The suggested words come from a predefined vocabulary, for example all distinct words in Wikipedia or in the Oxford English Dictionary. The number of words in the vocabulary can be large: Wikipedia contains millions of distinct words. The vocabulary grows even larger if the autocompleter is required to recognize multi-word phrases and entity names.', ""The heart of an autocompleter is a function that takes in the beginning of a word, or a prefix, and searches for vocabulary words that start with the given prefix. Typically, only a small number (about half a dozen) of possible completions are returned. There are many ways to implement such a function. Let's take a look at a few of the possibilities. We start from a straightforward but slow implementation and build progressively more efficient methods on top of that."", 'A naive implementation would iterate sequentially over the vocabulary words checking each in turn to see if it starts with the given prefix. However, this approach would need to compare the prefix against half of the vocabulary words on average. This approach is too slow for all but the smallest vocabularies.', 'A better implementation keeps the vocabulary words sorted in alphabetical order. Searching for a prefix in an ordered vocabulary is pretty fast with the help of a binary search\xa0algorithm. The binary search compares a query prefix against a middle element in the list to see if the prefix comes before or after the middle element. The binary search is then repeated recursively on the correct half of the list while the other half is ignored. Because every step of the binary search halves the range still to be searched, the total search time is proportional to the logarithm of the number of words in the vocabulary (as explained in\xa0this Stackoverflow answer).', '\nSearching for words starting with broc-. Binary search concludes that words must belong to the top portion of the list by comparing the middle element against the prefix broc-.', 'Binary search is usually used to find complete words but it works also for prefixes because in an alphabetical list all prefixes are also in order (that is, all words beginning with broc- come before word beginning with brog-).', 'An ordered list of words is an especially attractive data structure when implementing an autocomplete on a search engine because the search engine already maintains such a list as part of its inverted index.', 'Binary search performs pretty well, but it turns out we can do even better.', 'Typically many vocabulary words begin with the same prefix (broccoli, broker, brother and many other words all start with bro-). It seems wasteful to have to store the common prefix separately for each word.', 'A prefix tree is a data structure that exploits the shared prefixes to speed up the completion. Prefix tree arranges a set of words in a tree of nodes. The words are stored along paths from the root to leaf nodes.\xa0The edges corresponds to the letters, and\xa0the level on the tree corresponds to the letter position of a prefix. The first letter of the word defines which edge from the root to follow. The second letter defines which edge to take from the child node, and so on.', '\nA prefix tree for words need, nested, seed and speed.', 'The completions of a prefix are found by first following the path defined by the letters of the prefix. This will end up in some\xa0inner node. For example, in the pictured prefix tree, the prefix ne- corresponds to the path of taking the left edge (labeled with N) from the root and the sole edge (labeled with E) from the child node. The completions can then be generated by continuing the traversal to all leaf nodes that can be reached from the inner node. In the picture, the completions of ne- are the two branches reachable from the inner node: -ed and -sted. If a path defined by the prefix is not found in the tree, the vocabulary does not contain words beginning with that prefix.', 'Searching in a prefix tree is extremely fast. The number of needed comparison steps to find a prefix is the same as the number of letters in the prefix. Particularly, this means that the search time is independent of the vocabulary size. Therefore, prefix trees are suitable even for large vocabularies. Prefix trees provide substantial speed improvements over ordered lists (where the search time is proportional to the logarithm of the vocabulary size, as noted above). The improvement is realized because each comparison is able to prune a much larger fraction of the search space (all continuations except those related to single letter).', 'Prefix trees handle common prefixes efficiently, but other shared word parts are still stored separately in each branch. For example, suffixes, such as -ing and -ion, are common in the English language. Luckily, there is a way to store shared word parts more economically.', 'A prefix tree is an instance of a class of more general data structures called acyclic deterministic finite automata (DFA). There are well-established algorithms for transforming a DFA into an equivalent DFA that has as few nodes as possible.', '\nThe minimal DFA for words need, nested, seed and speed consists of only 9 nodes compared to 17 nodes in the original prefix tree in the previous picture.', 'Minimizing a prefix tree DFA reduces the size of the data structure. A minimal DFA typically fits in the memory even when the vocabulary is large. Avoiding expensive disk accesses is key to a lightning fast autocomplete.', 'The above describes how to implement a basic autocomplete functionality. These data structures can be extended in many ways to improve the user experience.', 'Often there are more possible completions for a particular prefix than what can be presented on the user interface. We might prefer to show the most commonly selected or otherwise most valuable completions first. This can be achieved by including an integer weight, which represents the value of a word, for each word in the vocabulary, and by showing the completions with the highest weight first. (For sorted lists and prefix trees it is trivial to store a weight in the leaf nodes. DFAs are more complicated, because a leaf node can be reached through several paths. A solution is to use a finite state transducer that associates a weight to a path instead of a leaf node.)', 'Prefix tree based completions can be extended to tolerate small spelling errors by following not only the exact path defined by a given prefix but also some neighboring paths with minor spelling variations.', ""A fixed vocabulary might be too limiting in some applications. Words entered by the user are prime candidates for completions in the future. To that end, the entered words can be inserted into the autocomplete data structure. Modifying the full data structure might be too expensive, however. A solution is to keep two data structures: one with a fixed global vocabulary and another with that user's words. The latter is much smaller and therefore faster to update."", 'While the autocomplete data structures are interesting, it is not necessary to implement them yourself. There are open source libraries that provide the functionality. For example, Elasticsearch and Solr and other search engines based on Lucene provide an efficient and robust autocomplete functionality.']",[]

In the January\xa0issue of Harvard Business Review, Professor Roberto Verganti from Politecnico di Milano, wrote a controversial commentary on the role of criticism in the early stages of innovation process.', 'Verganti argues that any development process aimed at great innovativeness should place focus more on developing ideas within a small circle of people. He proposes a four step process that should facilitate innovation through carefully applied criticism. It consists of the following steps:', 'Let me describe\xa0how I interpret these actions.', ""Verganti's proposal for reflection is best understood through an example. Introducing a case study of Vox, a polish furniture company, he describes a creative process spanning several weeks among a team of 19 company members. During this time, the participants were encouraged to explore their own ideas and build them independently. Another important aspect was that the participant were encouraged to trust their own feelings and reflection\xa0as the source of feedback. Instead of relying on user or customer insights, people were to draw on their own experiences."", 'I fully endorse individual reflection. Much of the bad publicity for ""Brainstorming"" and other forms of\xa0ideation comes from poorly organized and facilitated group work. It\'s important to acknowledge that much idea generation work can and should be done individually. Lack of time is often an\xa0issue, too. Although scientific evidence for the influence of incubation is incoherent, it does agree on the usefulness of taking time\xa0and having breaks in between your creative work sprints.', ""Constructive feedback develops ideas and the thinking behind them. The best way to get in the constructive mood is to get the feedback from trusted peers. Trust is extremely important to keep the recipient attuned to the feedback, to make them feel that the talk is about the idea and the criticism has not nothing to do with the person. This is not easy and requires trust in the feedback provider's good intents and professionalism.\xa0At this point, it should be clear"", 'Giving and receiving crits in a professional setting means that criticism is distinct\xa0from\xa0skepticism. Criticism should be a tool to challenge assumptions and propositions about an idea so that ideas\xa0can be developed further. It should not be confused with skepticism, which is a prevailing negative attitude towards an idea. Verganti firmly believes that applied this way, criticism can become an engine of innovation.', 'criticism can become an engine of innovation', 'Verganti lists numerous times in the hi-tech industry in which two great minds have together been responsible for developing groundbreaking innovations -\xa0Microsoft, Apple, and Google are all good examples. A practical challenge may be finding the right person to work with. Here Verganti proposes ""a pitching session meets speed dating"" arrangement for introducing people and ideas so attendees with similar ideas should find one another.', 'Verganti calls a group 10-20 people involved in a shared creative effort a radical circle.\xa0He proposes that after the ideas have gone through individual and peer processing, they should be brought to an assembly of everyone involved for the next round of criticism. Here, criticism should be presented\xa0at\xa0a workshop that actively improves the presented ideas as well as seeks to connect and combine these to reach new levels of innovativeness.', 'Everyone who\'s ever participated in anything resembling what\'s proposed above will know the challenges of destroying and recombining ideas people have cherished and championed for some time. To find a common ground, Verganti proposes to seek mutual understanding for ""no-go"" zones, common enemies or directions nobody has found desirable. By working through these areas of avoidance that constrain the design space, group may eventually converge on some shared understanding on what their greatest ideas and most hopeful directions are.', 'Verganti gives one interesting example of such design-by-committee success story. The Alfa Romeo 4C Coupe was developed by a radical circle. This circle came up with two ideas that they successfully merged: Lonely Planet guide for driving and responsive vehicles for passionate drivers. The outcome was a success.', '![](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/vUSHWYiPcs6Uws6EeK2Ko/a31b0f26a66f6bd4099e3aae0cc74f2f/alfa-romeo-4c-coupe_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png)\nAlfa Rome 4C Coupe, an outcome of work of a radical circle according to Roberto Verganti. Photo source: https://www.alfaromeousa.com/cars/alfa-romeo-4c-coupe', 'The final stage in Verganti\'s process is external evaluation. These outsiders (also called interpreters by Verganti) should preferably be from domains distant to the product at hand, so they can feed in new kinds of ideas on how to best progress with the creative work. The logic is that distinguished professionals from other areas may see and perceive things invisible for the radical circle. As an example, Verganti describes the aforementioned Alfa Romeo case. The outsiders involved in that project included ""a maker of leather goods, the CEO of a high-end resort, a manufacturer of fitness equipment, and a theater director.""', 'Verganti resists to mention anything about users or consumers in this stage either even though this group might have something valuable to say as well as we all proponents of human-centered design believe.', ""Should we trust Verganti on this? During\xa0my scientific career, I've had many heated and\xa0sometimes fruitful discussions about validating design and innovation methods. I see that Verganti is clearly pointing out a valuable, often neglected aspect of the creative process -\xa0proper criticism. This is healthy, as long as it prevents us from not getting too dogmatic about the approaches we adopt in our design (design as in design thinking) work. In this case, suspending criticism for too long is not healthy. \xa0I believe you must\xa0be critical within the creative process, just be considerate with it!\xa0But I also\xa0fear Verganti's methodology is also falling a victim of its own design."", 'You can be critical within the creative process, just be considerate with it!', 'I\'m personally skeptical about the self-referential design component, prominently present in the first step. I agree that it may lead to more outlandish ideas, it may be also be a great waste of time. Without exposing your ideas to other people, you may be captivated by your own specific circumstances and have difficulties seeing the forest from the trees. While you can expect professionals to provide a constructive comments in response to your ideas, presenting prospective users and customers will also give some real-world ""criticism"" which you just can\'t ignore. Verganti could name this fifth step ""5. Touch reality.""', 'I can\'t attribute much of the success of his cited cases to the proposed methodology. Creative processes -\xa0design processes -\xa0are subjects to many\xa0factors. Case studies, even the best ones,\xa0are unfortunately totally unsuitable to proof any solution of the format ""do this, don\'t do that"" as they can only serve to falsify certain approaches.', 'But I will cite one additional supporting ""case."" Apple\'s industrial design team is in size and behavior very much alike the radical circle discussed by Verganti. They are approximately 20 people who tediously and continuously crunch through ideas together.

Gestalt theories can be used as a validation tool for every design. Instead of scrutinising every single Gestalt principle one by one, try to learn them by heart and utilise them while crafting the design.', 'Balance in design is similar to balance in physics. A large shape close to the center can be balanced by a small shape close to the edge. A large light toned shape can be balanced by a small dark toned shape as the darker shape appears to be heavier.', 'Elements in a composition will either appear equal or one will exert some level of dominance over the others. The dominant element will attract the eye and get noticed first. To control dominance and to set different visual weights, the basic design elements such as colour, value, size, direction and shape can be used to create the effect.', 'Hierarchy is the order in which the elements within a composition are understood to be. The visual relation between elements creates logical order. Hierarchy can be built with placement, isolation and contrast. A single distinctive elements will most likely be perceived as being on top of the hierarchy.', 'Our senses easily recognise patterns and begin to expect changes according to them, like beats in music. Visual repetition increases predictability and helps the viewer to understand logical entities and order. A break in a rhythm also breaks the flow and draws attention.

However, there are a few basic rules to help you create a successful colour scheme.', 'Consider the target audience: always study both the demographics and the cultural environment.', 'Pick colours from source assets like logos, branding material and photographs identified with the theme.', 'Use shades and tints. Many successful colour schemes are made entirely with shades and tints of only one anchor colour.', 'Use complementary colours as focal points as the complementary scheme is intrinsically high-contrast and draws maximum attention. Be careful though, as complementary colours also create unwanted effects and eye sores when placed closely in full hue.', '', 'Stick to a simple collection of fonts. If you are unsure of good font combinations, create visual uniformity by applying only one font family to your design.

Use grids to place images and text. Horizontal and vertical lines are a great way to divide content, but remember that empty space also creates a line.', 'Apply colour or scale to create hierarchy.

The most used button of the design process is often ‚Äòundo‚Äô.', 'Visualisation is the most effective way to communicate. The tricky part is to ensure that the message gets through as intended.', 'If the message is simple and the basic rules of design are used correctly, our brain will do the rest of the work. Think of a stop sign as an example. Even if you haven‚Äôt been sipping bad coffee in a driving school, you still probably understand the basic signal delivered. The colour says ‚ÄúLook at me, I‚Äôm important!‚Äù. The shape says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to tell you something different than the other signs‚Äù. And finally the text underlines the true meaning by shouting ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù.', 'Good design should always aim to be self-explanatory, but that doesn‚Äôt stand a chance if the basics are wonky. As with the stop sign, some form of verbal communication is often needed to emphasize the message and to leave a memory trace. Once the trace is strong enough, the words aren‚Äôt needed anymore.

Running rapid experiments on social media and websites or at physical locations might be the right solution, especially if the campaigns can be quickly adjusted when problems arise or gold is struck.', 'Say we‚Äôre launching a service we assumed would be used primarily by teenagers, but ends up appealing to seniors, adjustments have to be made to the design as well as the technical solutions employed. The brand and marketing also need to play ball and react.', 'Let‚Äôs take a step back. The three main things to consider when doing something new: time, effort and costs.', '', 'In many companies, getting a large budget for extending an existing service is easier than a smaller budget for a new service. The thinking is that the investment in an existing business is less risky, but it also yields smaller rewards. New business has much higher risks, but also potentially greater rewards.', 'Once the decision has been made to invest in something new, money is no longer the primary issue ‚Äì it‚Äôs time and effort. In other words: how fast can we get something new to customers and where do we find the people to make it - with the latter intimately tied to the former. Top performers are already tied to business-critical projects that consume more than their allotted time, so even if you succeed in finding the right people, some are going to be tied to previous commitments. Especially for larger organizations, getting a project team together is no small feat. There‚Äôs a hell of a lot of syncing to do. It‚Äôs a hard calendar puzzle to crack and major source for inertia. Often building a new service requires experts from business, marketing, technology and design, from inside and outside the company. A fairly standard case might involve a business consultancy firm, a marketing agency, a design shop, a tech company and a few others.', 'That‚Äôs quite a mix.', '', 'Chances are great that somewhere along the line communication will become garbled and problems in critical cut over points will ensue - from business case to design, from design to implementation and from marketing to anything. There are too many business plans without a technology point of view or nice visual designs without a clear user journey and experience. Or a great service missing a brand that makes it lovable. How the hell do we make it work? As we‚Äôve seen, there are quite a few factors to take into account, but fear not: there‚Äôs a new method in town. End-to -end service creation using all the necessary competences.', 'The process has three main phases.', 'Concepting = business case + service design + MVP contentBranding = initial brand + marketing plan + go-to-market strategy', 'In this phase we gather as much information as possible from potential users. We create wireframes. We make important decisions about tech that have a major impact on implementation estimates. Words like native, hybrid, React Native, Elm, Cycle.js or Xamarin (maybe not) will be thrown around.', 'We create the first version of the service using appropriate web or mobile technologies, UX design, analytics, etc. This is the grunt phase of the project, where earlier plans and decisions start to take shape. The team works through the backlog and, sprint by sprint, the MVP is formed.', 'In this phase, the service is released to the wild and all the previous work is put to a real test. Once people start using the service start, the analytics start to gather data on how it‚Äôs used and by whom. The brand and marketing team finally gets some first-hand intelligence on how the initial plan is working and is able to iterate the plan.', '', 'The whole process may last one to three months and a few of the key people should be involved throughout the duration to ensure continuity: project lead, tech lead, design lead and/or brand lead. The core team from the customer side participates and learns all through the project, so the eventual handover goes as smoothly as possible.', 'Does all this imply that you are locked to a single vendor? Definitely not. As long as the company that owns the service also owns the rights to all the material produced in the project, a handover of any part can be made at any time.', 'The point is: the next time you plan to create a new service, think about whether anyone will ever know about it and could it be released in a fraction of the time you originally planned.']","['Create assumptions and plan', 'Perform initial research', 'Get real-life data', 'Adjust plan accordingly']"

There is plenty of teaching material (mainly on graphical programming languages) available for younger children (for example at koodikoulu.fi). However, far less material is available that is\xa0suitable for upper comprehensive school level and for learning text-based programming.', 'The curriculum states that in grades 7-9 the students will be expected to learn a text-based programming language. Our exercises are using\xa0the Python language because it is easy to learn, is available on many different environments and extends readily to large programs. Many of the exercises involve mathematical concepts because programming will be part of the math education in Finland.', 'We encourage anyone who is interested to mentor code club sessions at their local school. While no previous programming experience is assumed from students, a prospective mentor should have at least a basic level of expertise with Python. Necessary level of skills can be obtained by doing the exercises yourself, perhaps together with a friend who already knows programming.', 'The exercises could surely be improved further.

For general purpose controlling, we are combining data from various sources, such as sliders, knobs, pads and keys, processing it and directing it to multiple targets. For this kind of processing, the stream abstraction seems like a really good match.', ""To switch from callbacks to RxJS\xa0streams, we need to create an Observable that pushes events when MIDI input data arrives to the API. I wrote a simple RxJS Web MIDI bindings library for the task and it's used in the following examples. The previous callback-based message output example can be implemented with RxJS and the bindings library as follows:"", 'In the example we first convert the promise to an Observable with standard RxJS function fromPromise. We then map the stream so that it contains only the first MIDIInput object. In order to get the stream of all MIDI messages arriving to the input we use midimessageAsObservable from RxJS Web MIDI bindings library. As we are in a situation where we have a stream inside a stream, we have to use flatMap to get a stream of messages. After this we just parse the arriving messages and output them.', 'The previous example already looks nice, but RxJS streams provide even more benefits when mapping data from different inputs to a single or multiple\xa0targets. As an example, let\'s see how to control the speed of a repeating visual effect such as this pulsating Chilicorn. We want to be able to set the speed in two ways: by tapping a pad twice and taking the time between the taps (often referred to as ""tap tempo"") or by adjusting it directly by turning a knob. Internally, we use beats per minute (BPM) as the measure for the speed.', 'We start the implementation by creating two new streams that contain pad and knob input messages. inputStream\xa0variable is assumed to be set-up the same way as in the previous example. A stream of pad tap messages can be easily received by just filtering key events of a defined note from all of the incoming messages. Knob values can be received by filtering only incoming control values of a defined control number.', 'The tap tempo functionality can be created with taking interval between two consecutive pad tap events by using timeInterval\xa0function. A separate helper function msToBpm has been defined for calculating number of beats per minute (BPM) value from the time interval between taps. We also want to restrict the BPM to a minimum value for omitting situations where user has tapped only once and taps again after a long period of time.', 'For setting the speed with knob, we take the knob value and\xa0use a suitable multiplier which maps the MIDI control value (0-127) to BPM range of 0 to 199. Finally we combine the two streams and subscribe the resulting stream. When messages arrive, we set the BPM for our visualization code.', 'Even though the previous example was fairly simple, we can already see many benefits from using this approach:', ""The setup works well especially for sketching and for visualizations that don't require really heavy rendering or computation, as JavaScript and WebGL performance may not match native code using for example OpenGL. On the other hand, the setup allows rapid development with direct support for multiple platforms."", 'We used real-time visualization as an example of a controllable application, but these concepts should work well for any kind of application that may use data from external MIDI controllers.']","['The code is self-documenting and easy to read, even without comments', 'Specific data from input can be get\xa0cleanly by using filtering', 'Functionalities like tap tempo are easy to build with RxJS combinators', 'Event input, processing and the utilizing code are nicely separated']"

I was more than a little confused by these questions, until I remembered what it\'s like to write JavaScript. You make a change, switch to browser, set up debugging stops, click on a few things in the app, check the debugger and go ""Uhhh... How did that happen? Maybe I should console.log something?""', ""Writing Elm, on the other hand, is like this: you make a change, check the superb compiler errors, fix them. Next.

But all things considered, I value the guarantees Elm provides far more than the ability to do things quick 'n' dirty."", 'In the Summer of 2015 I had a stroke of luck. I got into a project, where there were no restrictions on the frontend technology. We were tasked with building a web application for a select few expert users, from scratch.

To place an article on the page, the user would drag it from the side panel into the main panel. Similarly, modules (article groups) could be dragged up and down on the page to determine their order.', ""Note: Back when we started the project, StartApp wasn't as big a thing as it is now.

This is in fact a mandatory separation in any Elm application. The language just works that way and there is no way around it.', 'Everything in Elm is immutable, from ""variables"" to function definitions to records (which are a bit like JS objects).

In short, we had a fully ""pessimistic"" UI that would save the state to the backend on every change. Pessimistic means that we never assume an operation to succeed, but instead we rely only on facts: what (if at all) the server responds.', ""The way we update the backend-provided data in the Elm application was the main kicker, though. Once we've POSTed a change to a list in the backend, we simply GET the whole list from the backend and replace the whole thing in our model. This means the state can never be inconsistent between the backend and the frontend. We also made sure only one of these tasks could be running at once simply by deferring data-changing user interactions until the UI had updated. The user could still scroll and click on things while the task was running, but not drag things from one place to another (which would imply a data change)."", 'There were two main concerns to this approach: 1) is the UI responsive enough with backend-only updates, and 2) is it madness to discard and replace the whole model on update. As it turns out, concern 2 was mostly unfounded. The Virtual DOM in elm-html does the heavy lifting, so on the browser only an updated item gets re-rendered. Concern 1 was valid though. As previously stated, our project was an expert tool. It would only be used from within the customer network, using desktop computers. In our experiments using a wireless connection (actual users have wired connections), we found the heaviest updates took about 600ms on average. This was before we optimized the caching, which sped things up ten-fold. As a result, pretty much all updates happen in consistently under 300ms, which is great!', ""The strictness of Elm proved invaluable. Since the compiler won't let you disregard a potential failure even when trying out something, there is no way some of them might end up in production code. Coupled with total immutability the language itself enforces good functional programming practices."", 'The place where Elm\'s restrictions can become hardships are when dealing with the outside world. For one, you need to provide full modeling of the data structure if you wish to parse a JSON response from the server. And you need to take into account that the parsing may fail at that point. This all seems obvious once you get familiar with Elm\'s type system, though. If your API is a little ""tricky"" - for example the response JSON can have certain properties that define which other properties are available - you may need to jump through hoops to make that work.', ""Another thing is interoperability with JavaScript libraries. First off though: Elm has its FRP and functional utilities built-in, and the elm-html package comes with virtual-dom, so there's no need for stuff like Lodash, React or Redux."", 'But if you do need to interact with JavaScript, the mechanism for that is called Ports. Ports are essentially strictly typed event streams to listen to (Elm to JS) or to push events into (JS to Elm). This means you will need to write some boilerplate-ish code, both in Elm and in JavaScript, in order to pass a message to the other side. So the more JavaScript libraries you need, and the more different kinds of objects you want to pass through, the more boilerplate code you will end up with.', 'That said, Elm is still fairly young and seems to be quickly gaining recognition in the aftermath of the ""functional web frontend tsunami"" React and friends brought about. The fact some commonly used library alternatives are still missing could soon turn. And while we\'re on the topic of dependencies, Elm has one more ace up its sleeve: the package system enforces semantic versioning. Because of the strict typing, the package manager can infer any outfacing changes to the package source code and determine the version number on its own. No more sudden breaking because an NPM package upgraded from 0.14.3 to 0.15.0!', 'Go and learn Elm. Seriously.

There are other differences between the two as well, such as the way they handle data. Elm uses persistent data structures under the hood, which means better performance in big apps.

Is data driven design finally the silver bullet to solve the problem of measuring user experience and creativity? Or is it the killer of all originality in the design solutions? ,"['What vs. Why', 'Quantitative vs. Qualitative', 'Before vs. After', 'UX is not just about numbers, it‚Äôs about feelings']","['Funnily enough, soon after publishing my previous post about measuring the business value of design, I came across to a excellent\xa0blog post about the negative side effects of design metrics and data driven design.', '', 'In the recent years there has been quite a buzz inside and outside the design community about Big Data, A/B testing, analytics and data driven design. On one hand, Big Data and analytics are seen as sources of ‚Äúhard facts‚Äù and thus a better basis for making objective business decisions than the ‚Äúsofter‚Äù data provided by most of the traditional user research methods. Especially some managers feel that in this era of analytics we can forget about the traditional user research methods and rely on analytics only. On the other hand, there are some designers & design researchers, who see basing design decisions on the analytics data as a killer for creativity & originality of the design solutions. So where lies the truth? As usual, it‚Äôs not black and white. It‚Äôs not the data itself that is good or evil, it‚Äôs more about how you use the data and different types of data have different uses.', 'Both traditional user research methods and analytics provide tools to capture behavioral data i.e. data about what people actually do with your product, which can be quite different from what they say. This data is very important in order to identify potential usability issues and in some extent, analytics can also be used to investigate the potential causes for these issues.', 'However, using analytics it is nearly impossible to capture attitudinal data i.e. data used to understand and measure people‚Äôs motivations, expectations, perceptions, emotions and mental models regarding the product. Without this kind of data it is difficult to understand why people use the product the way they do or why they do not use it. This kind of data can also be utilized in design phase in order to define e.g. the content architecture, navigation structure, brand and visual style of the product, which are design artefacts heavily relying on the user‚Äôs mental models, experiences and emotions.', 'It has been often argued, that analytics data is better than traditional user research data, because with analytics it is easier to gather and analyze larger amounts of data. But is bigger really better? Or is it just different? Quantitative data is really good for answering questions like how many, how often and how much. This kind of data allows designers to prioritize identified issues and focus their resources on improving those, that have the most significant impact on the usability and user experience. Also, when measuring something subjective, like emotional response, it is easier to feel confident about the results, if the amount of data is big enough.', 'However, quantitative data does not give any insight on why people do what they do and how to actually fix the identified problem and this is where qualitative data gathered using traditional user research methods can help. Also, quantitative, analytics based data is only about the existing users, whereas qualitative data can bring valuable insight about people who currently are not using the product. Having different types of data from multiple sources creates a more diverse picture about the actual and potential users of the product and generates actionable insights.', 'The context of use varies between different data gathering methods. Using the traditional user research it is typically only possible to gather data about de-contextualized and/or scripted use of the product. This makes the data more inaccurate compared to analytics data, which measures the actual, natural use of the product in real context. However, you first need to build the product in order to get analytics data.', 'Therefore, different types of data become useful in different phases of product development. In the beginning, when you are trying to gather new ideas and opportunities for the future development, user insights gathered using traditional methods like customer interviews can be a great inspiration to this work. Also, in the early phases it is possible to validate the initial business model, value proposition and intended customer journey with targeted end users which greatly reduces the risk of developing the wrong thing. During the product development phase it is useful to be able to validate the design decisions before actually investing into developing them and in this phase basic usability testing can greatly reduce the cost of development. Finally, in the end the product is released and in this phase analytics is a great tool for measuring the actual user behaviours and how the product is doing in relation to the business goals and KPIs set in the beginning.', 'As a summary, we can‚Äôt expect any type of data alone to address all the possible aspects of usability, user behaviour and user experience. As designers, we need to find a way to get all the different data types working together so that the data creates actionable insights to justify the design decisions. We need to understand what type of data is needed in different phases of the product development and use appropriate data gathering methods in each phase.', 'But even when we have all the possible data, user experience is not about numbers, it‚Äôs about feelings. So in addition to gathering data & facts to tweak the design, the designers need to use their creativity and imagination to provide experiences the users will fall in love with. Let the data be the inspiration to great design, but not the only guiding principle!', '![User thoughts](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/1Qh1Q0OxNCO4aQmkKyQOQ0/2bf88456d38d5f53b538ace5c0044251/user--by5hl0g1qk_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png)']",[]

Along the way, I learned a lot about what makes a great one. This experience has been surprising in many ways. There is a huge difference between a well-made application and a poorly written one. Spending a little extra effort into your application really affects your chances of getting that dream job."", 'This following list of items is what we ask for from applicants. However, I feel that most of the tips are applicable when applying anywhere.', 'This may sound odd, but a huge amount of applications do not actually tell us anything about the applicant. For example, almost on a daily basis, I receive applications where somebody sends me an email with just a phrase: ‚ÄùHere is my CV‚Äù. A CV tells what you have done, but it does not tell a recruiter about who you are.', ""Personally, I find this really silly. I also do a lot of staffing (building teams for projects). At worst, this work is a big Excel exercise where you match project requirements with people‚Äôs skills. I very strongly believe that this is not enough. A person's passion and ability to learn is at least as important as their current skillset. When I have interviewed people, one of the main complaints has been that in their current work, they are just treated as ‚Äúa resource‚Äù. Why would you treat yourself as one when applying?"", 'Don‚Äôt be afraid of telling who you are, what gets you exited, what are your values, etc. This is not only a great way to make the application stand out from the crowd, it also makes your application far more personal. Let your personality shine through! Furthermore, do not worry too much about losing opportunities due to somebody deciding that your personality does not fit the position. If this happens, you would most likely not want to do that type of work anyway.', 'A good application contains a huge amount of information. You should have your CV, school and work records, letters of recommendation, work and people references and everything else that showcases your talents or what you want to do. When some of this information is missing, it creates extra work for the recruiter. Unfortunately, due to the thousands of applications that we get, the reality is that sometimes I do not have the time to request missing information from an otherwise promising candidate.', 'Furthermore, I have noticed that my decision whether an application is ‚Äùgood‚Äù or ‚Äùbad‚Äù is made almost immediately. If my feeling is that the application is good, then I review it properly. If it is ‚Äúbad‚Äù then I try to quickly find a reason why the person is not applicable so that I can close the case and move on.', 'Try to understand who is reading your application. For example, I sometimes read hundreds of applications a week. As an HR professional, I get my kicks from helping other people out. I absolutely love to interview people. On the other hand, reading through applications is something that I don‚Äôt like to do. In fact, I consider it a necessary evil of my work that is tedious and boring. I cannot say that all HR people are like me. However, I know that quite many share my feelings about job applications.', ""How can you help make a recruiter's life easier? There is no simple answer. A good way to test your application is to give it to a friend or family member and give them 1 minute to read it. Then ask what their thoughts about it are. If they liked it, give them an extra 5 minutes and see if they understood what you were trying to say."", 'I have found that a good summary or cover letter goes a long way. Provide instructions to the reader. Tell which attachments are more important than others and summarize them.', 'You can also take this further and make it fun! Do not worry about trying out new things. Send a video, use fonts and templates that are not according to standards, try to be funny and tell jokes. You can do this as long as you feel that it correctly portraits who you are. If you get rejected because if it, then most likely the company was not for you anyway.', 'It‚Äôs really easy to think of job finding as a statistical game: if the likelihood of being invited to an interview is 1%, then I have to send this application to 100 companies. This is partially true. However, your goal should be to increase the likelihood of getting an interview, not the amount of applications.', 'Once again, try understand who is reading your application. I, for example, am extremely proud of Futurice: what we have achieved and what we do. Someone who has personalized their application specifically for us is sending me the message that they are willing to spend more effort on something that I am proud of. This immediately makes me like the person. ;)', 'From another point of view, I receive a lot of applications that are clearly mailed to some mailing list or could easily be re-targeted by just changing the name of the recipient company. The feeling I always get from these is that the person does not care about us. My initial reaction is to respond back similarly (i.e. copy-paste a standard rejection letter). I have been discussing this with my colleagues here at Futurice and at other companies, and found that most recruitment professionals share my views.', 'The simplest and often most effective way to personalize your application is to tell why you want to work for the company. Describe how you share their values, if you are excited by their products, if they have done something that caught your attention or if you know people that you respect and trust from the company.', 'This is also a great exercise for you to figure out where you want to work. Study the companies which you are applying to. Obviously, if you cannot find any reason why you would want to join a particular company, then maybe you should focus your time and energy on something that is more aligned with what you want to do.', 'What is the purpose of a job application? When I have asked the candidates this question, the answer is quite often simple. A job application‚Äôs purpose is to get you through the door to the interviews. Its job is to stand out and shout ‚ÄùPick me!‚Äù from a pile of applications.', 'However, I feel that this is an oversimplification. A job application is not just an advertisement of your skills. It should also convey your wishes and desires. It should shout ‚Äùpick me, if you are able to offer‚Ä¶!‚Äù. Initially, you might think that this lowers your chances of getting through to interviews. This might even be true. However, ultimately it‚Äôs always you who accepts the job proposal! In other words, my job is to offer you something you want to do. If I feel that I am able to do this, then I actually prioritize you over others.', 'Oddly enough, this is often missing. At Futurice, we specifically instruct people to tell us what you want to do. Still, almost half of the applications do not contain this information.', 'I have always found this a little bit sad. There are many people who are not satisfied at their current job. I have always wondered how many of these would have found a job that they wanted if they had included this information. The ""where"" part is easy. Just tell me where you would like to be located. If you are willing to go anywhere, then state this. This is a minor detail when applying, but it helps companies with many locations (such as Futurice) out a lot. To be honest, this is more about ‚Äúmaking it easy‚Äù from my point of view.', 'This probably is the hardest part, but also the one where you can really make a difference! How can you prove yourself without physically meeting another person?', 'A good application is full of statements such as ‚ÄùI‚Äôm a team player‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am a fast learner‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am really passionate about this work‚Äù. As mentioned before, I like these, because they tell me who you are. Furthermore, I like to validate these when I am interviewing the person.', 'What I have learned is that most people are able to prove their statements ‚Äì many with really concrete proofs. I then often ask why they did not include these in their application. People felt that these are not part of a ‚Äústandard‚Äù application or that the validation is done during interviews anyway (as an application‚Äôs job is to get you through the door).', 'Ultimately, my job in recruitment is to find these concrete proofs. All the interviews and tests we conduct are actually a means to find them. Recruiting a new person always carries a big risk. Does the person fit into our culture, is he or she smart and gets things done, and fun to work with? Therefore, we cannot make an offer to a person before we are confident that we really understand who the person is, what he or she wants to do and is capable of. If you can already include these in your application, you are not only creating a very strong case for why I should meet you, you are also placing yourself much closer to a situation where we can give you a job offer.', 'I recommend that you give your application to somebody else and ask to identify all such statements. Then, go through every one and try to come up with a way to prove it. For example, if you say you have a passion for software development, submit links to your hobby projects or showcase how you participate in the software community. If you state that you are a fast learner, get a recommendation letter from your previous supervisor explaining how long it took you to learn something new. If you state that you are funny, tell a joke and make me laugh!', 'I really hope that you find this useful.']",[]

Big design up front, have a proper plan and stick to it come hell or high water. This is called superb commitment, and will reward you plenty in the long run.\nDuring the project you will gain a lot of new information. This can be about market, end-users, technology, or even about your own organisation. When you design upfront you design without this information. Try to defer (design) decisions as much as possible, but not more. You still need to make the decisions instead of delaying them infinitely. Just in time will do nicely.', ""2. Have many people with lots of different roles. It‚Äôs easier for people when they just have to take care of their own thin slice of things, and the responsibility is nicely spread over lots of people!\nFragmenting responsibility increases optimisation of parts rather than the whole. Involving more people makes the communication more tricky and prone to failure. Set up a small team, and emphasize everyone's responsibility for overall success."", '3. Have strict, need-to-know basis on all information. You know, like secret agent style! This encourages the previous point, people only taking care of their own turf, and it is easier to have gatekeepers for information too!\nA good running lean team means an empowered team with lots of autonomy and self organisation. They will do their best to optimise their work. Not sharing information in this situation means that they lack the information to optimise their work and will generate waste.', '4. It is crucial that everything is documented! We need to have a proper trail.\nIn most organisations a paper trail is only used to play the blame game. Documentation is important, but focus on documentation which is needed after the project is over and the service is in actual use. Create documentation only when it clearly serves a purpose.', '5. Have a fixed process that is used on every project, document, meeting, and essentially on everything! This way you can enable massive benefits of scale from previous successful projects. People will also feel familiar with things easily!\nRigid processes have bad effect on the flexibility of your team, and can severely impair your ability to adapt to changes and find the best ways of working that suit for your team. Same things usually don‚Äôt work for everything.', '6. Stick to well-established company tools. We paid so much for them, now we need to use them whether they fit or not.\nThe team should have as much power of choice on their own ways of working. Others can point the team on what is to be done, but how it is done should always be defined by the team.', '7. Developers are likely a bit stupid, better pre-chew as much as possible for them to make their life easier. This will make them more productive and happier, as they will have less demanding work, and less of it. It‚Äôs also very helpful if, instead of talking about the features using your own language, you translate it into extreme technical detail to the best of your ability, since developers aren‚Äôt able to understand normal words and would never care about the value a feature adds to the users.\nIf developers wanted to work on simple stuff, they‚Äôd work at a meat packing station. Facing and overcoming interesting problems makes the work rewarding. When you get to decide stuff, you feel more ownership of the product, and thus motivate for greater effort. Also, talented developers are actually great at solving complex problems (provided they have access to enough information and are given enough flexibility)!', '8. Don‚Äôt trust any others to do decisions themselves, because they might not know the stuff as well as you, and will just ruin everything. You can only trust yourself in this desolate wasteland, so have all the important stuff run through you.\nWhen you hire smart people at high rates, try to give them as much autonomy as possible so they can best optimise their work. The lack of delegation easily leads into you becoming a bottleneck for the process. This demotivates other people as they feel that they can‚Äôt make any decisions without taking them through you. Also nobody likes control freaks.', '9. You also know your business better than the end user do, so don‚Äôt feel bad about making decisions for them too.\nWhen you create new digital services, you‚Äôre most likely creating something nobody has ever done before. This means that all information from existing services is not valid and at least needs to be verified. Agile development enables you to react to feedback, use this capability!', '10. If things, for some reason, don‚Äôt go well, just add more resources for enhanced problem solving. Throwing more people and money at the problem usually solves it.\nPlease just don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre only adding to the complexity here. First make sure you have a well oiled team. This most often means reducing noise and simplifying things. After that you can considering scaling the well working team, but not scaling first as then you‚Äôre likely scaling up the problems too. Always check with the team whether adding resources would help or only make the problems worse.']",[]

When applying the same concepts globally and historically\xa0things become much more difficult, so let‚Äôs look at some basic concepts of date and time and see what makes them complicated. Some of the examples are simplified in order to keep this article compact.', '![The Prague astronomical clock showing both time and astronomical details](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/5dtxudwk0oOMy8iOcoCkEQ/ce61e26f1ebd9572b98d97cc485b03a9/530100860_433a8bb8e0_o_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.jpg)\nThe Prague astronomical clock showing both time and astronomical details (photo by Kainet, CC BY)', 'A system measuring astronomical cycles, such as years (revolutions of the earth around the sun), months (revolutions of the moon around the earth) and days (rotation of the earth on its axis).', 'One difficulty\xa0is that a month is actually somewhere between 29.18 and 29.93 days long depending on the location of earth on its elliptic orbit around the sun. Actually it‚Äôs even more complicated than that, because we can measure a full rotation in several ways, e.g. based on its location with respect to the stars or with respect to to the sun. In any case days in a month is a fractional number and difficult to calculate. Similarly there are about 12.36 months in a year, which is also an inconvenient number. The most common calendar in use is the Gregorian calendar, which is used in pretty much all international standards and forms the basis for many other calendars. However, other calendars, like the Islamic Hijri calendar\xa0which uses completely different date numbering,\xa0are\xa0also in official use.', 'In addition to the officially used calendars, it is quite common to use traditional calendars for different traditional holidays. For example the Orthodox church still continues to use the Julian calendar (astronomically less accurate predecessor of the Gregorian calendar) for their holidays. Also, holidays in China often fall on the new moon or the full moon, which means they still need to be determined by the traditional Chinese lunar calendar.', '![Ancient Aztec/Mayan calendar](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/643nqoPVmgie8mYgiSquWq/c3a96cca4736d4ddee6f179344ecbe3e/6377784239_8b07c69cc1_o_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.jpg)\nAncient Aztec/Mayan calendar (photo by Kim Alaniz, CC BY-ND)', 'The year numbering system used by a certain calendar during a certain period.', 'This is purely cultural. There are several calendars currently in use that are identical in how they measure dates, months and years, except that they count the years differently. The Gregorian calendar counts years from the assumed birth year of Jesus of Nazareth, but traces back to the Roman calendar which used to count years from the founding of Rome. The current Gregorian calendar era is traditionally called anno Domini, as in year of the Lord, but here we use the alternative name Common Era (CE), as the era is now widely used in non-Christian context as well. As another example, the official calendar in Thailand since 1940 is a renumbered Gregorian calendar so that year 2015 CE is year 2558 BE (Buddhist Era), the buddhist era starting from the assumed year of the Buddha leaving his body and attaining nirvana.', 'Similarly\xa0Republic of China in Taiwan is using a Gregorian calendar where the first year is the year the republic was founded, so year 2015 CE is ROC (Republic of China) year 104. Coincidentally the ROC calendar is identical to the Juche calendar used in North Korea since 1997, because Kim Il-Sung was born on the same year as the Republic of China was founded. Japan has also migrated to the Gregorian calendar, but officially still keeps using the old Chinese practice of numbering years, which means restarting the era on every ascension of a new emperor. The current era in Japan is Heisei of emperor Akihito, and year 2015 CE is year 27 of Heisei.', '![Modern Japanese 500 yen coin minted in year 18 of the Heisei period (2006)](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/5gkYUlNlwceGEQWiOKsswY/cffef63c397fa67d1226b4541b20ed42/500jpy_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.jpeg)\nModern Japanese 500 yen coin minted in year 18 of the Heisei period (2006)', 'A system dividing the rotation of the earth on its axis to smaller units that are easily and accurately measurable, mainly hours, minutes and seconds.', 'What makes time problematic is that the rotation of the earth is not constant and varies depending on the time of the year, due to the elliptic orbit of the earth. This has been solved by using the mean solar day in calculations, since it is almost constant between years. Almost. Events like tidal friction, earthquakes and movement of the earth‚Äôs crust affect the rotation.', 'Currently the variation in rotation is solved for scientific purposes by defining the SI second as periods of radiation of the caesium 133 atom. There are over four hundred clocks around the world counting time based on this definition, and together they define TAI (International Atomic Time), which is the basis of our current time. In addition to this, there is another definition of time called Universal Time, of which the UT1 version is the one that has remained in use. This definition is based on the mean solar time at 0¬∞ longitude and therefore drifts a bit from TAI depending on the rotation speed of the earth. Therefore, finally, a concept of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) was created, which follows TAI, but adds or removes leap seconds to keep itself always within 0.9 seconds from the ‚Äúreal solar time‚Äù UT1.', 'The history of time in itself is extremely interesting, and I very much recommend visiting the Royal Observatory, Greenwich London to understand how the measurement of time has changed our society and saved countless lives. However, the introduction of UTC has more or less solved the problem of time itself in our daily lives and all the civil clocks in the world are now synchronised to it. Its slightly weird abbreviation is actually a compromise between CUT proposed by the English speakers and TUC (for ‚Äútemps universel coordonn√©‚Äù) proposed by the French speakers. There is an ongoing debate of whether leap seconds should be removed to simplify calculations, but that would mean UTC would not follow the Universal Time any more.', '![Shepherd Gate Clock, likely the first public clock to show Greenwich Mean Time](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/5QL2fCWVnqOuE8smOA2wck/8c9afbaecd25db349ea3c4469c558df2/shepherds--s7yorhhqlk_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.jpg)\nShepherd Gate Clock, likely the first public clock to show Greenwich Mean Time', 'A region that observes a uniform standard time, meaning all clocks in the region are synchronised to show the exact same time.', 'The problem time zones are trying to solve is that people are historically used to time their lives by using midnight and noon as reference points. Always observing the local solar time, as was still common in the early 19th century before railway networks were developed, is not practical, because people would have to resynchronise their clocks even on short travels. Also, it would have been easy to set all the clocks in the world to UTC (or its predecessor GMT, Greenwich Mean Time), but it would mean that e.g. midnight in Hawaii would be at 10 AM. The locals might very well get used to this, but it would be very difficult for everyone from\xa0other regions to realise what is early and what is late in Hawaii. Hence, time zones were invented as a compromise between these two.', 'Most time zones are simply offset from UTC by a whole number of hours, and even if the number of hours is not whole the concept is very clear. There are mainly two things that make time zones very painful to handle: Daylight Saving Time and constant change. Daylight Saving Time is very controversial and was first implemented by Germany and Austria-Hungary during World War I in order to save coal, but it has been widely adopted in the Western world since the 1970s. The idea is that the clocks are moved\xa0forward during the summer in order to have more daylight after the workday. However, it is not clear if this saves much energy in the modern world where heating and especially lighting is constantly developing at a fast pace, but what is clear is that it makes local time non-continuous and difficult to handle.', '![An artistic sundial in Greenwich, with a changeable plate for DST](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/vcmhOX6pO0wGmAioe4qWS/c87f35630ea89489308cce900c17b288/dolphins_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.jpg)\nAn artistic sundial in Greenwich, with a changeable plate for DST', 'To name some difficulties, for example in the EU, the last Sunday of March does not have the time 3:30 AM at all and the last Sunday of October has the time 3:30 AM twice. What makes things more complicated is that different countries move to the Daylight Saving Time on a different date, and on the southern hemisphere it is actually from around October to April, which is opposite from the northern hemisphere. One cannot even rely on the midnight being 00:00 on a 24-hour clock, because in the Gaza Strip (the political status of which is very unclear, but is de facto governed by Hamas) they have decided to move to the Daylight Saving Time on the last Friday of March exactly at midnight, which means midnight on that day is actually at 1:00 AM. People have often combined a date with a zero time to construct a local midnight timestamp, but even that cannot be relied on without validation.', 'Another problem is the constant change, which means that the time zone rules are not stable. For example in only the last five years since 2010, the time zones in Russia have had three major changes that have changed both the boundaries and also the DST rules observed. In 2011 Samoa moved from UTC-11 to UTC+13, practically skipping a day. The People‚Äôs Republic of China during its founding abolished the time zones in 1949 to simplify things and since that year everyone has followed Beijing Time all over the country, but even this is not as simple as it sounds. They experimented with the daylight saving time from 1986 to 1991 and this still needs to be taken into account on events that happened on those years. Also the fixed time causes the western parts of China, mainly Xinjiang and Tibet, to have sunrises as late as 9:41 in the winter and sunsets as late as 21:50 in the summer. Therefore the Uyghur minority in China have established their own time zone and having a clock on a certain time can even be considered a political statement in the Xinjiang area.', 'There are numerous\xa0other unexpected changes as well, the most recent one being North Korea changing their time zone from UTC+9 to UTC+8.5 on August 2015, because they consider the UTC+9 zone introduced by Japan during Japanese colonisation of the Korean peninsula\xa0imperialistic. Recently Egypt and Morocco\xa0in turn have decided to observe Daylight Saving Time, but so that it is suspended for the Ramadan period, so they actually turn their clocks four times a year. Countries in general consider their time zone as part of their identity, which means political changes often result in time zone changes.\xa0Nevertheless, when working with time one can never escape history, because historical events still need to be placed on a timeline.', '![Time zones without DST on August 2015](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/5uh46MH4FGokEsG8coOGu0/2d066851fd742c9238bc40fea677f6b6/standard_world_time_zones_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png)\nTime zones without DST on August 2015 (by TimeZonesBoy, CC BY-SA)', 'After understanding the basic concepts, there are some small details that should be taken into account when using computers to calculate time. The international standard for handling date and time related data is called ISO 8601, and the definitions used here are more or less in line with the definitions of ISO 8601.', 'The most common\xa0way of counting time instants with computers is Unix time, meaning seconds that have elapsed since\xa000:00:00 UTC,\xa0January 1st, 1970.\xa0In general when working with time in seconds one doesn‚Äôt have to worry about anything.\xa0Leap seconds are the only possible problem, because Unix time handles leap seconds by replaying the last second before leap second to keep in sync with the UTC. Modern frameworks and libraries usually use a variation called\xa0UTC-SLS (UTC with Smoothed Leap Seconds), which slows down or accelerates the clock 1000 seconds before the leap second to minimise its effect. Only applications that need extreme precision have to take leap seconds into account.', 'When talking about hours one has to pay a bit more attention to the presentation. The main thing to understand is that when we humans talk about an hour, it pretty much always means 60 minutes. But because of time zone changes, 60 minutes from 2:30 AM can be 3:30 AM or 4:30 AM or something completely different, depending on the time zone and the date used. Therefore, always when working with time one should realise that a time instant cannot be presented in local time used by humans without also knowing the date and the time zone used.', 'It is very much recommended to do date handling using the Gregorian calendar, since it is the basis of ISO 8601 interchange format for dates and times. The important thing to pay attention to is the slightly unintuitive arithmetics caused by variable length months. For example date 2015-01-31 + 2 months results in date 2015-03-31, but depending a bit on the implementation date 2015-01-31 + 1 month + 1 month results in date 2015-03-28. This is naturally because February does not have 31 days and it gets rounded down to the last day of February which is the 28th. Same thing happens with years when doing 2012-02-29 + 1 year, which results in 2013-02-28 because of the leap year. But unlike with time zones, people are usually already used to these anomalies. The financial markets use 360-day calendar to avoid these problems, but that‚Äôs another topic.', 'Date on its own is mostly useful for recording things like birthdays or independence days, which people celebrate on the same day regardless of where they are. Dates can also be combined with time in order to create a local date and time combination, but without knowing the exact time zone used it is neither possible to validate if that date and time combination exists nor is it possible to convert it to UTC timestamp for chronological comparison. Converting a date from one calendar to another should always be safe and very useful in doing localisation to different regions. And last but not least, one should never assume that a day is 24 hours or any number of minutes or seconds. It might be, sometimes even without exception, but it should not be assumed.', 'Time zones are quite well described in the earlier paragraphs, but there is one very common misunderstanding about them that needs to be corrected: many seem to think that by combining a UTC timestamp with the local time zone UTC offset as in ‚Äú2015-09-01T08:00:00+03:00‚Äù is enough to handle the time zone problem completely. This is true if one only cares about the exact time when an event happened (a timestamp) and the local time when it happened. But if we want to do any operations on that time, like add hours or days to it, we need to know the actual time zone where the event happened to keep the local time representation in sync. In this particular case the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) time zone name would be ‚ÄúEurope/Helsinki‚Äù, and with that information we can add days or hours to it without risk of losing track of local time.', 'Because the time zone rules can be extremely complicated, there is a quite comprehensive database called IANA time zone database, which is used by almost all operating systems and platforms. It is sometimes also called the Olson database by its original author Arthur David Olson. It does not even try to maintain exact time zone information for zones that have ceased to exist before 1970, but for zones that are currently still in use it has quite comprehensive history dating all the way back to the 19th century. The database is maintained by the community\xa0and if anyone finds inaccuracies in it, they are free to send an email to the maintainers\xa0with an explanation and proof of the required change, and it will most likely be included in the database.', 'Instant means an absolute instant of time, which usually is represented by Unix time or a date of Gregorian calendar combined with UTC time. Instant can always be calculated from local date, local time and time zone. Instant can always be converted to local date and/or local time if the local time zone is known.', ""Duration can be any length of time that one would\xa0conveniently measure with a stopwatch, including seconds,\xa0minutes and hours. A stopwatch doesn't have information about leap seconds or DST rules, and neither does duration."", 'Period means a calendar period between two dates, for example one month or two weeks. Practically period is almost the same as duration, but it is often handled separately to avoid confusion. For example a duration of one day is always 24 hours, but a period of one day could be 23 hours or 24 hours or something else depending on DST rules.', 'Interval means a duration between two known instants. It can be constructed from two instants, or alternatively from an instant and a duration, in which case the other instant is calculated using the duration. Interval is defined in ISO 8601,\xa0but not very often used and therefore for example Java 8 date and time API does not include support for it at all. Interval is most useful when wanting to calculate if two known durations with a starting time overlap or not.', 'I have tried to sum up the most important things I would like to know if I had to work with date and time handling for the first time in my life. I genuinely hope this is useful, and works as a short reference when dealing with the problems above. I also hope to have time to write a bit more practical real world examples of how date and time should be handled in computer programs, but that is saved for another blog post.

Identify the research questions carefully and go to train stations, airports, lobbies ‚Äì to places where people must stay for a while - and just ask people for a short moment of their time. Colleague of mine went by train from Tampere to Rovaniemi to evaluate a mobile game, and that setup was a success ‚Äì lots of eager participants for the test sessions!

Few focus groups of five to seven participants produce huge amount of data, so in few days you can easily gather almost thirty people‚Äôs insights. Good practice is to continue the research as one-to-one interviews based on the analysed data from the focus groups. One-to-one interviews give you the chance to dig in deeper to the questions that were left open during the focus group ‚Äì this is quite common to happen, as in focus groups you cannot focus on just one person and his perceptions, even if those were really interesting.', 'Also when designing experiences, ethnography is a method used to capture human behaviour in the context of the person‚Äôs natural environment. It is a method that enables researcher to gain insights about people‚Äôs behaviours and unarticulated motivations and needs in order to create innovative solutions.

This function should only express the logic we mentioned above, yet it goes into details which are irrelevant to its purpose.', 'The function might be a source of bugs and an obstacle during debugging in the future. The reason for that is: while debugging, it is likely you will look getEuroString() through the perspective of one level of abstraction (""it checks if the value is a decimal, to use the decimal format, otherwise uses the integer format"") and dismiss the lower levels of abstraction, assuming they are correctly doing what you want them to do. And that is where the problem is: letting an assumption slip away unchecked.', 'Instead, we should refactor the function so that it uses other functions which hide those lower level instructions.', ""In this fashion, you facilitate the assumption validation process when debugging: when inspecting getIntegerEuroString() or any other function, it will be straightforward to check whether it only does what it says it does. Each function makes it obvious on which level of abstraction it operates, so you don't need to mentally switch between different levels of abstraction when inspecting the function. It focuses your mind, pointing you in the right direction for hunting bugs."", 'Overall, programming practices that prevent bugs are empathic to other programmers and to your future self. Code which looks obvious and looks easy to read and change is code which eventually yields less bugs.', '""Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.""‚Äî\xa0Brian Kernighan', ""To prevent bugs, write code that looks easy in any programmer's eyes.

So there definitely is a valid reason to state, that good design also makes good business. But how do you know if design is good? Too often design is evaluated based on gut feeling and personal likes or dislikes only, but to me, good design is design which meets the business targets.', '‚ÄúGood design is good business‚Äù -\xa0Thomas Watson Jr., former president of IBM', 'This post explores what are the mechanisms in which the design investments contribute to the business success. So, is it possible to actually measure the financial impact of individual design projects? The obvious answer is, that it depends on the business you are in, your selected competitive strategy and the objects of design i.e. what are you actually trying to achieve with the design project.', 'As suggested by the Design ROI model developed in Aalto University, the objects of design can be categorized to Product, Brand, Service and Space. Design can be used e.g. to make your brand more relevant to your target audience, provide products that are more lucrative and create service experiences that differentiate you from the competition or spaces that let the products shine and make them easy to discover. Depending on the business you are in, all these categories or only some subset of them may be relevant to your business and the measurement criteria for design depends on both your business domain and the selected objects of design.', 'In order to identify the relevant objects of design, you can utilize traditional business tools such as SWOT analysis, STEEP/PEST analysis and competitive analysis. Or you could use scenarios planning or Drucker‚Äôs paradigm of change model to think how your business is going to evolve in the future.', ""![Drucker's paradigm of change model](https://images.contentful.com/pqts2v0qq7kz/3THDF2Kr8skA8eeCwQYys4/c6ecf1927396c347605ec15df3e26bd0/drucker--gjw2adtlcf_s1800x0_q80_noupscale.png)\nDrucker's paradigm of change model"", 'In his classic book Competitive Strategies, Michael J. Porter identifies three basic competitive strategies: cost, differentiation and focus. Whatever strategy you have, design related research can help you to understand your target audiences more deeply and design can be applied to bring the target audience the desired benefits, be it cost savings through process efficiency, products catered specifically to their needs or differentiation through brand or product features. Again, different competitive strategies are relevant in different business domains, but regardless the domain, only one player in the domain can be the cheapest, others need to position themselves somewhat differently in order to stay competitive.', 'As already mentioned above, the business domain you are in has an impact both to the relevant objects of design as well as selection of the competitive strategy. There are some quite obvious combinations of competitive strategy and objects of design, e.g. using product design to gain cost reductions in the business of manufacturing physical goods or using brand design to differentiate from competition and thus boost sales in retail business. But it might also be worth thinking outside the box. Even if you are in B2B domain manufacturing physical products, you could differentiate yourself through branding. Or you could also differentiate by providing value adding (physical or digital) services to your customers. You could even use space design more creatively. What if investing in design of work spaces would actually boost the efficiency of your employees and thus create cost reductions or increase production capability?', 'In retail business, all the objects of design probably are relevant, if you have selected differentiation or focus as your competitive strategy. But even then, you can get more creative in combining objects of design with your competitive strategy. What if your promotional space would combine digital and physical aspects to create even more appealing experience? Or could your promotional space actually be in virtual reality? Even if you‚Äôre doing retail through digital channels, could inclusion of some physical service enhance the experience of your customers?', 'And these were just a few examples. The ways of combining objects of design to competitive strategy & business domain are numerous, but whichever combination you choose, the keys to success lie in understanding your customer‚Äôs needs and catering to those needs. And that‚Äôs where design can have a huge impact, regardless of your domain.', 'Well, as with any measurement case, you need to start with the targets first. So what is the purpose of the design project? Often design briefs specify the target to be brand strengthening, improved usability or user satisfaction or even creating innovation. While these measures might be useful as such, I‚Äôd personally like to dig a little deeper and figure out what is the expected financial benefit you expect to get. E.g. if you you want to strengthen your brand, why do you do that? If it is to increase sales of an existing product or product specific margin, shouldn‚Äôt you measure those instead of brand awareness?', 'Or if you want to enhance user satisfaction, what is the actual impact you expect that to have? Should it contribute to number of returning customers? Or to the actual price the users of your products are willing to pay?', 'Whatever the target, I‚Äôd like to define as concrete financial measurements as possible, because that is the only way to justify the design investment. And when you have your financial targets in place, you need to figure out the current state, the baseline to which you‚Äôll be comparing things in future and which you can use as the basis for calculating ROI for your design project:', 'ROI = (Gain from investment - Cost of investment) / Cost of investment', 'where gain from the investment is new value - baseline value. With this calculation, you‚Äôll be able to play with different scenarios for the ROI of your design project. What if the design project enabled to you save 10% in your yearly production costs? Or if it enabled you to sell 15% more? Or increase the product price by 5%? You can use this calculation to define the exact numeric targets for your design project to justify the design investment and you can also use the same criteria afterwards to define whether the design project was successful.', 'When evaluating the success of a design project, one more thing to consider, is that changes to other variables besides the design should be kept constant. E.g. if you were trying to increase your sales volume and started a product design project in order to achieve that goal, you should keep constant the other aspects of the product than the design itself, including things like product price, promotions etc. Also, it‚Äôs probably wise to focus on one object of design at a time, because otherwise it‚Äôs quite impossible to figure was the increase in the sales volume caused by the changes in product design, in service design, in brand design or in space design. But this depends on the case, for example when launching a completely new product, you should probably aim for a holistic experiences across all the objects of design.', 'So, in summary, you can use design in many ways to support your business strategy and it is possible to measure success of design projects, both in terms of ‚Äúsofter‚Äù criteria like brand awareness and customer satisfaction as well as in terms of ‚Äúharder‚Äù monetary indications. So next time you think about starting a design project, spend some time to consider what is the business impact you are trying to achieve and what is the most relevant criteria to measure the success of the project! And don‚Äôt keep that information secret from your designers either, because without the information on your actual targets it‚Äôs quite impossible for them to help you to reach them.']",[]

I\'m\xa0happy that it was a\xa0learning experience for many of us and next time we are in that high pressure board room we can think back to\xa0the\xa0day we spent at\xa0The English School and say to ourselves ""hey this is a doddle.""', '\nFutu designers taking a break in the school staff room', 'So the natural icebreaker for us was to connect what we were doing (design) with what we assumed kids were doing. We know kids are iPad friendly already at about 5-6 years old and are playing games like Minecraft and Angry Birds, most of them already have a smart phone, so that was to be our common ground. It was fun listening to our teams trying to explain what designers and developers do to 6 year olds. Good practice I‚Äôd say, for any of us,\xa0if we\xa0want to find ways to cut through the bullshit\xa0business jargon.', '\nAino explaining what a service designer is', 'With the concept of teaching kids how to code in mind, we started to get the children to open up around the subject of digital. We asked them about their favourite games and music, we asked them to draw some cool apps for us that they would use. Without any difficulty at all, and faster than we could keep up, we had a whole bunch of concepts already on the table. The creativity of the children totally inspired us and it was refreshing to see how a young creative mind is free from the technical feasibility lens that we adults place on ideas often before we even start.', '\nYoung children have no barriers to their creativity', '\nChris and his team of game designers create ""DragonCode""', 'The role of the teacher in the class was to us also a great source of inspiration.\xa0It was lovely to see how the teacher acted more as an enabler for learning rather than the old\xa0model of ""teacher""\xa0especially around\xa0digital topics where the kids were often very much the experts.', 'The children were remarkably brand savvy. Words like Apple, Netflix, Spotify, Google, and many others were just part of their 6 year old vocabulary. I remember at many points during the morning thinking back to my own school days and reflecting that the world was a very different place back in the 70‚Äôs. For better or worse I wonder how this new world order will benefit these kids in the future now that digital is\xa0a way of life for them.\xa0As a parent I often feel the pain of trying to get my kids away from the dreaded\xa0""Screen Time"" to\xa0doing more physical activities with other children.

https://futurice.com/blog/scrum-masters-toolbox-sprint-length,From the Scrum master's toolbox: sprint length,10 Jun 2015,Ways of Working,The sprint length is an important parameter to set. Both long and short sprints have their up- and downsides.,"['Sprint length', 'Long sprints: 3 weeks or longer', 'Stretch goals', 'Mid sprint checks', 'Sprint stability indicator', 'Upsides \xa0', 'Short sprints: 1 week', 'Alternate activities', 'Upsides']","[""First a big note. The team sets the sprint length, not the scrum master, not the PO, and not the customer. The PO sets constraints in terms of expected deliveries (e.g. you can't have 4 week sprints if the delivery to production needs to be every 2 weeks). The scrum master does not set the sprint length. She coaches the team and can gives advice, but she should not decide the length of the sprint as it is the team who needs to make a shippable product at the end of each sprint."", ""In a 3-week long sprint you have a very long time between the planning and the delivery. This means that the shipped product will deviate more from the desired product, as there is less opportunity to adjust the direction. For example, at the sprint planning the commitment is for stories A, B ,C, D, E, F, but after one week, story E is less important and a new story X enters the picture. In an ideal case the PO would have wanted a product with stories A,B,C,D,F,X but she'll get A,B,C,D,E,F."", 'You should also expect the team to be able to commit to less. This is a simple consequence of compound uncertainty. Say we have story A and it has some technical uncertainty (e.g. unsure if an API has a good working cache). We also have a story B which also has some uncertainty but is is also impacted by story A. As story B is impacted by story A there is an additional uncertainty in story B which would not be there if story A was implemented.', 'There are ways around those downsides. A typical way of dealing with compound uncertainty is the use of stretch goals. These are items from the backlog, which are in the sprint but are not part of the commitment. This is very risky in terms of expectations and needs a lot of coaching of the PO so it is clear that these stories are not part of the commitment. ""The team is committed to deliver stories A,B,C,D,E. If all the stars are aligned and it doesn\'t rain you might get something of F or G.""', ""Another tool you can use to deal with long sprints is to introduce a mid sprint check. This is a small get together where you take a small step back and see if the current sprint is still on track. You can use a simple thumbs up/down to ask the team if they believe the commitment can be made. This would also be a point where you come to the conclusion that the sprint is not meeting its goals. In this case don't hesitate to abort the sprint. Aborting a sprint should be more common in a long sprint as the uncertainty is larger. \xa0You can also do a light version of the mid sprint check during the dailies, just make sure that don‚Äôt start the discussion in the daily but take the discussion to a separate gathering."", 'Your sprint backlog will change. Supercritical stuff will pop up, stories will get blocked. With a long sprint this is far more likely and you should expect the amount of change to be more than just the linear extrapolation of a short sprint (a 3 week sprint will have more than twice the amount of change than a 1.5 week sprint). A good practice is to measure this change as a sprint stability indicator. It is simply the fraction of completed stories which were part of the planned stories (including stretch goals). 1.0 means all stories which were completed were planned, while 0.0 means none of the stories completed where planned.', 'The benefits of long sprint are especially visible when you are running a distributed team. \xa0Phone conference meetings, no matter the technology used, are less effective than face-to-face meetings in two ways. Firstly: you are constrained by the tools you use to facilitate communication, and secondly you miss out on a lot of social interaction. The long sprints can help justify the expense of having co-located sprint activities, as meeting in person once every three weeks is cheaper and costs less travel time than meeting weekly or every 2 weeks', 'A second related benefit is PO availability. A perfect PO has full authority and autonomy to make big decisions related to the product. In practice these people are, especially in large organisations, high up in the hierarchy, \xa0and quite busy. So in practice you most often deal with a proxy PO who has limited autonomy to make decisions. Having a long spring might make it possible to have the real stakeholders and the real PO in the room so that the feedback you get as a team is more relevant and the decision makes get better information regarding the project.', 'Make sure you take advantage of the longer sprint activities. If you have a 3-week sprint ist it fully justified to take a full day for it. Taking a full day for these activities make it easier to organise it outside of the normal working space, which helps team building, and it helps to create the right mindset for retrospectives.', 'Short sprints have consequences as well. A sprint ends with a shippable product. Any time you spend on the release process you will have to do more often, and hence the total time spent on release activities is bigger. A second consequence is that sprint activities take relatively more time. In an ideal situation this just scales, so that in a three week sprint these activities take three times as long. In practice this is not the case; there is some overhead in any meeting.', 'To deal with the overhead of sprint activities you can choose to alternate some activities. For example you can do retrospectives every two weeks and a detailed story breakdown session the other week.', 'The downside mentioned above can also be an upside. The big question to keep in mind is ""Is it worth solving?"". Is the problem you are facing because of the short sprint length a problem that is important to solve? If this is the case, than encountering that problem often is a great thing. It gives much more learning opportunities, and a larger pressure to solve it and more opportunities to experiment.', 'Short sprints also work well if the project context is unstable, projects where there is a lot of disturbance and where priorities are changing often. With short sprint questions like ""Can this be done I need it urgently!‚Äù can be answered by ""Yes we can do it and we\'ll start working on it Wednesday."" \xa0Which is, in most cases, acceptable.']",[]

Based on my personal experience, I must say that UX design for B2B systems is definitely more challenging.

","['Productivity', 'Motivation', 'Changing worklife', 'Safety of people and data', 'Development efficiency', 'Employer image', 'Competitive advantage']","['In my previous post, I highlighted some differences between designing B2B systems and designing consumer web or mobile applications. Based on my personal experience, I must say that UX design for B2B systems is definitely more challenging. But then again, in B2B world, the users typically have to use the system as part of their work, whether they like it or not, which means that there is no need to hook the user with instant feelings of ‚Äúwow‚Äù or other mechanisms that are used in consumer products to impress the user. Typically, the user isn‚Äôt the buyer of the product and the buyer may not be very aware of the work of the actual user. This means that the purchase is often made on some criteria other than great UX, such as pricing, number of features or familiarity of the technology.', 'Having said all this about B2B systems being professional tools purchased by IT pros and used by paid experts, there is one question that begs for an answer: do users‚Äô feelings even matter? In my opinion the answer is a big YES, and this post explains why.', 'In today‚Äôs turbulent world, the competition is getting harder in almost all domains. This often means that the same work tasks need to performed with fewer employees in order to reduce costs, i.e. the productivity of the single employee must increase.', 'Good UX in B2B tools means that the tool supports the user‚Äôs work. When the user can focus on performing the core tasks, such as monitoring and adjusting an industrial process or driving a heavy machine, instead of trying to understand or remember how the UI works, he can get more results in the same amount of time.', 'Good UX of support systems, like tools for creating and approving expense claims or reporting hours, can boost productivity, too. When the support tasks can be performed efficiently, with a convenient and understandable tool, the user has more time for the actual work and can thus be more productive.', 'The correlation between the usability of the tool and overall productivity is quite easy to understand, but UX is not only about usability. If the tool is pleasurable to use, the user will be more motivated to use it and perhaps more motivated in their work too. There are several user studies that show a strong correlation between employee motivation and productivity. If users get emotionally attached to the product, they are more likely to take better care of it, which can mean huge cost savings in machinery repair and maintenance costs. So, aesthetics and emotions can actually have a huge impact on costs as well. Motivation can actually be considered a multiplier for productivity. There are studies showing that in problem situations motivation results in persistence, preventing one from deviating from the goal-seeking behavior.', 'The worklife is going through a variety of changes. People switch jobs more often than they used to, and working with the same company for 20 to 30 years has become the exception rather than the norm.\xa0 At the same time, people stay at work longer than they used to, because the age limits for retirement are getting higher and higher. Companies use temporary workforce more than they used to, in order to balance their cost. In addition, some of the work may be outsourced to developing countries, where the workers are often less educated.', 'All of these changes bring new requirements for the UX of B2B systems. The most obvious demand is that B2B systems need to become easier to learn for new, temporary or less educated users so that they can be productive from day one. In extreme cases, this may mean, that the UI must be understandable to the users without any textual information, due to user illiteracy.', 'The way tasks are performed with B2B tools needs to become easier to remember so that older users and users who have not used the system for a while can still remember how the tool works. At the same time, the existing power users need to maintain their efficiency, which means that a thorough understanding of different users and their needs is crucial for the UX designer.', 'Properly done UX work ensures that the number of errors the user makes (because of the tool) is minimized and that the user can somehow recover from the errors. \xa0When the UX work\xa0is done\xa0properly, it can significantly reduce the number of mistakes caused by the tools and ensure that the user can quickly recover from any mistake he may have made.', 'This is especially important when you are dealing with products that operate something in the physical world, such as machine user interfaces or process automation systems. In such cases, a seemingly small error that occurred because of poor UI design can lead to huge profit losses or even risk people‚Äôs health and lives.', 'Another thing to consider is that, in their free time, the users of B2B systems are users of consumer products, which naturally raises their expectations towards the look and feel of B2B systems. If the users become frustrated and feel that the B2B system they are forced to use is cumbersome and not enjoyable to use, they might start devising unauthorized workarounds in order to have better UX. This kind of behavior may lead to loss of critical business data or compromise information security. Sometimes, unauthorized workarounds may cause even bigger risks, especially when operating assets in the physical world.', '', 'A user centered design/product management process ensures that we cater to the real needs of the target users and weed out unnecessary clutter from the product‚Äôs feature set. In fact, when the B2B system has been developed with the minimal viable feature set and tailored to the needs of the target user group, developing and maintaining the system becomes more cost efficient.', 'The time required for developing some ‚ÄúNice to have feature‚Äù may not sound too bad in terms of development costs, but once the feature has been implemented it needs to be maintained throughout the product‚Äôs long lifecycle. In addition, each new feature adds complexity and clutter to the UI. \xa0You could say that the price tag for each additional feature is much larger than it initially seems. Furthermore, in large and complex systems, features can impact each other and the introduction of new features may break some of the existing ones in unpredictable ways. Same applies for removing features, extracting a seemingly useless feature might cause surprising effects in some other part of the system. Proper UX design is the de facto process for figuring out who are the target users that the product should serve and what are the features needed by those user groups.', 'When competition for good and motivated workforce gets harder, the employer image plays an increasingly important role in attracting the best people. Happy and satisfied employees are more likely to recommend their employer to their friends and acquaintances . As discussed above, the tools people routinely use in their work play an important role in keeping employees positive and motivated. You can often hear people complaining about the tools they must use at work and this definitely does not boost image of their company as a good or caring employer.', 'As competition toughens on all domains, it will be harder and harder to differentiate from the competition. The unfortunate fact is that advanced features and technologies can be copied quite quickly and even patents don‚Äôt necessarily safeguard them.', 'Have you ever considered that great user experience which stems from understanding end users, their work and their needs is something that is harder to copy than technical features? I believe that in the future, great UX can become a true differentiating factor in the B2B world, especially when the B2B sales people learn to justify and back it up with hard, measurable KPIs, such as productivity improvements and cost efficiency.', 'Taking all the above mentioned factors into account, I would say that UX in B2B is at least as important as UX in consumer products. In these different contexts, the emphasis might be on slightly different aspects of UX, but the overall importance of UX work cannot be underestimated. In the next post I‚Äôll finally get to the culmination point of this trilogy and talk about processes and best practices that can help in creating great UX for B2B products, so stay tuned!']",[]

""And generations forget. The people in charge of innovation 30 years ago are now in the sixties or seventies. People forget."" As and example, Hane-san tells about Sony, a company he has worked with quite a lot. Sony was hugely innovative in the 1980s (e..g, Sony Walkman) and it made Sony big. As it grew, it became more embedded in employees personal lives: pension systems, workplace stability and so on.

Once the Japanese technology companies of the 1980s became global successes, they lost the burning desire to innovate. And then, it seems to me,\xa0few decades of content global business plus a new generation of leaders made them forget the way they were innovative in the first place. Now as Japanese ageing is a societal challenge and digitalisation is shaking old structures the big companies find themselves looking for ways to innovate, and outsourcing innovation to startups is seen as a viable and smart option.', ""Now I'm back in Finland.

Then gradually we in Europe have stolen the Silicon Valley way of thinking into our companies. And now, the Japanese are making notes of how we in Finland\xa0have made American ideas like The Lean Startup and Service Design our own. Needless to say, they will adapt our ideas to suit their situation."", 'In the technology world it is nice to notice that some things are cyclical, and looking into the past might be more fruitful than gazing into the future. I firmly believe that technology building is perhaps the most human endeavour in the world (e.g., there would be no tech without humans).

https://futurice.com/blog/cms-done-right-vol-2,"CMS done right, vol. 2",8 Apr 2015,Learning,Henrik Saksela writes about using Prismic.io to manage the content of a customer-facing site.,"['Prismic.io, a SaaS CMS', 'Representing your data', 'Creating a site with Prismic.io', 'Conclusion']","[""\nThe document editing view featuring Prismic.io's example project\u200b"", 'Last week, Futurice published a post documenting one team‚Äôs experience using a CMS purely as a content repository, accessed through an API from a separate presentation layer. Our team had a similar experience, but because the customer‚Äôs demands were not as strict as in the previous case, we were able to choose a SaaS solution instead of a locally hosted one.', 'What follows is a short description of our experience using Prismic.io to manage the content of a customer-facing site.', 'The requirements for a content management system were clear: the site was to contain a bunch of marketing material that would have to be updated periodically\xa0by nontechnical users. Not wanting to set up our own CMS, we started looking for something that would take care of the content management part, and offer us an API to serve the content with minimal fuss. Prismic.io seemed to fit the bill.', 'Prismic.io is a SaaS content management system. It‚Äôs a concept that makes a lot of sense. Editable content is a universal problem when developing bespoke web applications, and rolling your own solution is often cost prohibitive. Faced with the idea of having to set up your own CMS, moving your content to a cloud-based SaaS provider and bypassing the issue of administering yet another application feels like a smart decision.', 'Getting started with Prismic.io is easy: you set up a repository, create some content, grab an SDK\xa0and off you go. You can also get started by using the example repository (content for a pastry shop, complete with dozens of pictures of delicious cupcakes) and a sample project to consume that content. Starter projects are available for a large number of platforms and the SDKs cover even more ground.', 'Prismic.io‚Äôs data model is basically a set of documents plus some attributes used to categorize them. A document‚Äôs contents are defined by something called a document mask. This is a JSON document that declares a document‚Äôs fields and their types. You get a bunch of data types for your basic values, such as text, numbers and images. Additionally, a type called group allows you to create nested sets of fields that repeat (nested groups are not allowed, though) and a type called link allows you to reference other documents. A document mask can have any number of document instances that ‚Äúimplement‚Äù it.', 'Collections and tags are used to categorize documents. Collections are basically just named queries into your data and don‚Äôt really add any metadata: you define a set of document types and a set of tags, and your collection will contain all the documents that match any of the types and all of the tags. So really, for categorizing documents, you‚Äôre left with tags, which are labels that you can attach to documents.', 'Finally, you get a query syntax for retrieving documents, which\xa0allows you to fetch documents through the API using different parameters: document mask, tags, author name and so on.', 'You can create all manner of structures for your content using the model provided by Prismic.io. You could opt for a hierarchical structure where links between documents build up bigger entities. Or you could use a system in which a tag denotes a document as belonging to a certain page and a page is built up of multiple documents rendered one after another. This is what we did for our project.', 'All in all, using tags to denote pages worked quite well. We defined a bunch of document types to represent different fragments that could be combined to build up the contents of a page. As documents are unordered, we had to add a synthetic sort key to each document type. This key could then be used to order the documents belonging to a specific tag. Creating a custom document type to store the mapping from URLs to tag names allowed us to create a completely new content page by creating a new tag, associating some documents with it, and adding a new entry in the mapping table.', ""This approach, however, led to one of the problems we encountered: you‚Äôre not really given any control over how the interface for editing your content is presented. And you have to use the interface, as Prismic.io‚Äôs API is read-only. In our case, the editor would bring up the content to be edited by querying the interface for a certain tag. The interface wasn‚Äôt, however, aware of our synthetic sort key, so the results presented to the editor would be a jumble of small content snippets in seemingly random order. It would've been nice to be able to define an order for these in the editing view."", 'Another limitation we ran into was with Prismic.io‚Äôs workhorse for formatted content:\xa0structured text. It provides a WYSIWYG editor for a subset of HTML, containing the following tags: h1, h2, h3, p, strong, em, a, img, em, ul, ol. It would‚Äôve been convenient to extend this to cover linebreaks, for instance, or to have been able to annotate images with CSS class names to control text flow. We found mentions of people implementing their own solutions to interpret [classname] -type tags within the content for these purposes, but we didn‚Äôt want to go down that road.', ""Near the end of our project, we realized how convenient it would be if, for editors logged into the site,\xa0we could display an ‚Äúedit‚Äù -button next to each content fragment that would transport them directly to the editing interface for that fragment's document. Alas, it turns out the URL for the edit\xa0page contains an internal document version string that isn‚Äôt exposed through the API, which prevented us from realizing this idea."", 'These are fairly minor gripes, however, and all in all Prismic.io helped us accomplish what we set out to do.', 'The system for versioning merits a special mention. It‚Äôs quite nice. When you modify a document, you initially end up with a draft version. The draft version has to be published into a release (or directly into the master release) to be visible. Releases are sets of changes that are made visible at the same time\xa0and mirror approximately the idea of branches in version control systems. What makes this especially nice is that you can build in functionality in your application that, in a session scope, overrides what content release it works against. This allows you to preview upcoming releases on your actual site.', 'All in all, Prismic.io shows promise as a viable alternative for hosting content. Its minimal API lets us focus on building a site without worrying too much about the content part. Our customer, who edits the content, seemed satisfied as well. We‚Äôre looking forward to seeing how Prismic.io continues to evolve.', 'Finally, Contentful looks like another interesting alternative in this space, feel free to let us know about your experiences with it!']",[]

","['Alternative for a plain CMS', 'Custom solution results']","['Here at Futurice, we‚Äôve had some experience with content management systems like Liferay and Drupal. Many traditional CMSes are large monolithic packages, which can cause problems. We‚Äôve had our share. The most essential drawback to using a full CMS is probably the tight coupling between content creation and content presentation. We‚Äôve also had issues with scalability, performance and build times, among others.', 'Last year a customer asked us to build a public, CMS-powered website. The customer provided us with strict performance, scalability and availability requirement, which drove us to think of an alternative approach to the conventional CMS-solution. We wanted to make a modern, horizontally scalable website, but this seemed difficult to do with a traditional CMS-architecture. We also knew that there were going to be integrations to customer‚Äôs backend services at a later date. Implementing these on top of a CMS sounded like a huge mess. To address these issues, we started to consider separating content management and presentation as dedicated services, which would then communicate via a well-defined API. Completely separating the CMS from the presentation seemed to bring with it some extra benefits like enhanced security, too.', 'Initially, we considered using a content management platform, such as prismic.io or Contentful, and building a separate presentation layer with a web framework. This seemed like a good solution at first, but there were two problems. First, the customization demanded by the client‚Äôs requirements seemed too complex to handle with a service where making alteration on the code level wasn‚Äôt possible. Second, the customer thought they might need an integration to an existing SSO-service for logging in to content management. This seemed problematic to do with a solution we weren‚Äôt hosting ourselves.', 'With SaaS content management services ruled out, we considered using just the content management features of a traditional CMS system and creating a custom API for communication with the separate presentation layer. We decided on Drupal for the content management layer and Symfony MVC framework for the presentation layer. Although we would have preferred using something other than PHP, we felt that there were some benefits to be gained from using the same language in both layers.', 'As with many projects at Futurice, we decided to use Amazon AWS for hosting. Since only the customer‚Äôs content managers use the Drupal, a single server instance with a replicated database seemed to suffice. The public website requirements dictated small response times and high availability, so multiple Symfony instances behind a load balancer were needed. We also set up automatic scaling, so that new instances would be added dynamically when the load gets high. High availability requirements meant that we couldn‚Äôt have frontend instances be directly dependent of Drupal. We solved this issue by implementing Redis caching between the presentation and content management layers. Currently, the cache is being populated periodically, but with some extra effort it could be done by hooking into Drupal post save process and pushing the data to cache when updating content in CMS.', '\nA simplified architecture diagram for the solution', 'Most of the work involved was quite straightforward. The integration between Symfony and Drupal was implemented using a custom JSON API module to Drupal. Most of the work done in the presentation layer was just normal frontend coding.', 'There were some problems with the architecture, though. Content preview before publishing was probably the biggest issue. Since Drupal normally utilizes it‚Äôs own presentation layer for displaying content in the administration view and our solution had a separate presentation layer, we had to build a custom solution. We also had minor problems with a couple of situations where third-party Drupal modules required direct access from presentation layer to Drupal, but they easily resolved.', 'Was it worth it? I think it was. The overall architecture of the service is clean, with high availability and good performance. Since we are now starting to integrate the client‚Äôs backend services to the presentation layer, we‚Äôre going to implement the involved business logic in a separate service as well. This allows us to maintain a clean separation of concerns and responsibilities while adding new features.', 'All this will get us closer to a microservice architecture, which seems like a good solution for services like this.', 'We will soon publish another blog post on our experiences with prismic.io in another CMS project.

This phase is about creating a product that users love.Optimization based on key data and metrics, scaling up the product technically and commercially, and continuously improving internal and external quality are the primary drivers for phase three.', 'Here some practical tips:', '1. Put all your experts in the same room \nMoving workstations around is a nice, concrete first step to take when making your organization‚Äôs product development process leaner. Getting experts from different fields to communicate with each other is vital for the success of digital services. Take your planners, designers, developers, content creators and marketing people, and stick them in the same room.', '2. Know your customer and find a problem worth solving\nLive with your target group. A personal experience with a user‚Äôs issues will always leave a stronger mark than reading second hand research reports. In the early phases of the design process, we should look to the users for inspiration and an understanding of what constitutes a problem worth solving, as well as insight into the their everyday lives. Be open and curious, but keep in mind it‚Äôs not up to the user to spell out what he or she really wants. Figuring it out is your job.', 'Here are some excellent tips to help you get closer to the user: http://giffconstable.com/2012/12/12-tips-for-early-customer-development-interviews-revision-3/', 'Meeting and getting to know the customer is how you find problems worth solving. For the user, a problem worth solving is significant, expensive, common and a source of frustration - a problem the user is willing to pay to have solved. He or she may already have tried to solve it or circumvent it altogether.', '3. Design the emotions the user experience evokes\nExpert organizations have a tendency to view customers as rational agents and underestimate the importance of emotions as a part of the design process. Appealing to the user‚Äôs emotions can have a considerable impact on the decision to buy.', 'Think back on things you‚Äôve bought lately. Were you swayed by a list of specifications and rational argumentation or the fact that you just liked the product? A user experience that evokes emotions doesn‚Äôt happen automatically or as a by-product of some other process. It requires design.Deep design creates a harmonious whole that is more than the sum of its parts. If the product is built by the book, from the ground up, while hewing tightly to a rigid priority list, the end result will probably be quite adequate, but it won‚Äôt inspire an emotional reaction.', 'Lean development processes and design complement each other well. Incremental design requires a strong vision. Otherwise the core idea of the product risks being lost in the compromises that are an integral part of the development process.', '4. Validate your business assumptions\nIn the beginning, all you have are some educated guesses related to how to build a successful business. These assumptions are validated along the way. Honest feedback from outside the project team is essential: users, markets or other stakeholders. From the point of view of creating a successful business, most of the people you need to convince are to be found outside the project team.Testing is considered a cumbersome part of the process and it strikes fear in people. In 2014 our own Risto Sarvas wrote an article titled You can avoid customer-centeredness, but you can‚Äôt run away from the customer (Asiakaskeskeisyytt√§ voi v√§ltell√§, mutta asiakkaita ei voi juosta pakoonin Finnish).

Continue fighting for user-centered design.', '5. The customer is product development‚Äôs crowning achievement\nDeveloping a product and growing its customer base should go hand in hand when building new business. Some questions you need to consider early on in the process: how are you going to identify and find potential customers? How will you pique their interest in your product and get them to commit to buying it?By putting everyone in the same room, the lean product development process essentially eliminates the artificial division between product development and marketing, allowing for closer consideration of how features under development will impact customer relationships.', 'Don‚Äôt forget to utilize marketing automation and build in the necessary metrics.', '6. Get a great product manager\n‚ÄòThe product guy‚Äô is an important role in many Silicon Valley companies. He or she is like a product manager and in a startup, the role is as central to the success of a company as that of the programmer and the designer. The product manager looks at the way the company functions from a product perspective and through the value of the product. It‚Äôs the product manager‚Äôs job to find the balance between user needs, business demands and technology. The product manager makes the tough choices when prioritizing functionalities. A good product manager is like a junior \xa0CEO: influential, good at networking, understands the customer and the markets, sees the big picture and makes good decisions that maximize product ROI.', '7. Lightning-fast feedback guarantees quality\nIn addition to the developers‚Äô know-how, the environment they work with has a critical impact on the cost-effectiveness and quality of a software product. Testing changes should be possible within seconds. Make investing in and building development and testing environments, tools and automation an early priority for your project. \xa0Imagine two professional chefs, both working on a new recipe for a pasta sauce. The first one is allowed to taste the sauce boiling in the pot whenever he wants. The second one has to carefully package a sample, call a courier and send the package to be tested by someone whose taste the chef is in no way familiar with. Which chef do you think will create the better sauce?', '8. Don‚Äôt build everything yourself\nOnce your understanding of your customer‚Äôs problems is deep enough, it‚Äôs easier to find ready-made solutions for those problems among what other technology vendors offer.

The rest of the stuff you can buy from the cloud or China. Utilizing open source components and putting your own components out there is worth considering, too.

For example, when making traveling plans,  flight search engines with specialized filtering options are often more useful than general search‚Ä¶","['Building your own search engine', 'Future and conclusions']","['At first, the thought of developing a custom search engine might sound like a colossal mistake. Competing with Google‚Äôs almost limitless engineering resources can‚Äôt end well. However, there are search tasks where a custom search engine might be a better fit than Google. While Google controls much of the web search, people often prefer to find more focused answers to their queries than just a list of links. A person who is shopping for home supplies may search directly on an online shopping site instead of first visiting Google, because the results on the web shop are more targeted. Indeed, according to The New York Times, Amazon controls a larger share of shopping searches than Google.', 'Topical search sites specialize in providing the best possible answers on one specific topic. They aim to offer a better user experience, for example, by pruning nonessential results. A movie search engine only lists recommended movies to watch, a people search engine helps find contact information for friends, and a news search shows the latest news items arranged by theme. On a general web search engine information may get buried among irrelevant links.', 'A topical search engine is often able to offer superior search tools that are targeted for the task. On a hotel search engine, the results can be filtered by price, by rating, and by the distance to nearby attractions. A similar level of filtering is next to impossible on a web search engine where one can only input text. Sometimes data may lend itself to be explored through maps, timelines or other advanced visualizations. A customized search interface is often more suited for this kind of structured data.', '\n\u200bTopical search engines usually have diverse filtering options.\u200b\u200b\u200b', 'Many mobile apps are essentially topical search engines. Apps can search for nearby restaurants or book hotel rooms. On mobile, the need for an effective search interface is perhaps even more pronounced that on desktop, because of less available space and generally clumsier interface for switching between apps and web pages.', 'Another reason for building a custom search engine might be that the data is not publicly available on the web; for example, searching in user‚Äôs private email or chat logs, or querying data that is made available only to paying customers.', 'If you decide to build a search engine, you don‚Äôt have to start from scratch. Many search companies offer enterprise search for organizations. An enterprise search service automatically indexes intranet and other organizational resources and provides a single search box for all the data. Google Custom Search Engine and Yahoo Search BOSS make it easy to build focused search engines that return results just from hand-picked sites. For example, a search engine that only covers a few reliable music review sites can guarantee to return only relevant results for somebody interested in reading music reviews.', 'Often more control over the search is needed. In that case, search platforms, such as Elasticsearch and Solr, are better alternatives. They can be used to integrate customizable advanced search features into any application. Both Elasticsearch and Solr offer fine-level control of how results are ordered, versatile querying and filtering capabilities, autocompleting of search terms, spelling correction and lots of other features that are expected of a modern search engine.', 'As the amount of data produced by humans, integrated sensors and gadgets continues to grow, there will certainly be an ever increasing need for search engines to make sense of it all. Therefore, it is worth paying attention to advancements in search technology.', 'Future trends might be consolidating different topical search engines into a meta-search engine. Instead of having separate apps for different kinds of searches, there could be one site that infers which topical search engine is best able to answer the query and relays the query to it. Google is already starting to do this when they are able to infer the intent from the search terms. For example, searching for ‚Äúflight Helsinki to New York‚Äù on Google will show a timetable of departing flights above the organic results.', '\nGoogle\u200b shows special result view for certain types of queries\u200b\u200b', 'Not all search problems are solved by general web search engines. A custom search engine is useful if it can provide a better user experience for a specialized tasks or when the data is private.

However, the expectations put on designers by the talent market can often be just as implausible. Modern design work with short iterations and tight collaboration with multidisciplinary professionals in a rapidly developing digital environment sets a huge load of requirements for the designer.', 'To cover a full stack of core design facets requires a set of strong social skills combined with both technical understanding and artistic vision. These capabilities are sometimes perceived as somewhat contradictory features that rarely occur in one person. It could even be argued that such a trait is impossible because our brain is not wired to multi-task, as some neurological studies suggest.', 'Then, what is this search of multitalented people all about? Is the pursuit of unicorns doomed from the beginning? The situation is difficult both for designers trying to match the intimidating expectations, and for companies trying to discover talents suitable for the current demand.', 'Unwrapping the buzzwords helps to understand the expectations and motives better.', 'The transition from sequestered silos and hierarchic company structures to modern working methods and a transparent work culture has created a craving for ‚ÄúT shaped‚Äù people ‚Äî creative professionals that are ‚Äúgreat at this one thing and familiar with all this other stuff‚Äù.', 'The principal skill describes the stem of the letter. In comparison to people with very narrow expertise, the T shaped people are so inquisitive that they like to branch out into other skills as well. Those skills form the crossbar of the letter. For digital designers this means being functional in all core facets of the the design field (research, concept, interaction, user experience\xa0etc.), and focusing on one of them.', 'Ideally a T\xa0shaped designer can offer deep expertise, combined with breadth to understand the bigger picture. A genuine, personal interest in matters affecting design (e.g. business, research, technology) can have a drastic impact on the end result.', 'Although a clear focus on one competence creates deeper understanding, it can be dangerous to have just one area of profound expertise since the value of any single domain within this self-renewing industry can erode rapidly. For example, research as it used to be has lately vanished from the design map as a singular entity and merged into other design areas.', 'Current attention is shifting towards people with double-stemmed skill sets. The search is out for people who are strong not in just one but two skills. Particularly a two stemmed foundation of visionary design skills with a hands-on approach to front end development seems to be the weapon of choice for many smaller scale software projects. Providing a kick of both design and development, these double agents are a perfect fit for the fast, iterative, prototype-and-learn way of working that is hailed as the way to go in software development.', 'The two stems of the pi can also both stand solely on the design field. People with strong interaction design skills matched with UX and visual design abilities alike are often great for a design lead role. Just as well, business oriented service designers can be great for a purely consultative design role in a project.', 'A certain level of seniority is often incorporated in the pi\xa0shaped skill set, as building expertise in multiple domains often happens over time. Past work experience from different fields hardly ever offers up-to-date world-class expertise, but it still gives great depth for the bigger picture and complements the skills acquired more recently.', 'Being a pi\xa0shaped freshman isn‚Äôt that uncommon either since many designers and developers take their first steps by self-learning a variety of different skills before selecting a narrower field to focus on.', 'It‚Äôs important to realise that learning a new skill doesn‚Äôt make your other skills any less important, because skills aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. Improving your skills in research methods doesn‚Äôt make you forget your UI design tools. Learning new stuff might have some time costs, but it still works in favor of a multidisciplinary approach. Design is like any other craft where skills develop incrementally and sometimes painfully slowly. Mastering one design component might take a lifetime but being adequate in two or three might be conquerable in a couple of years.', 'Although the pursuit of unicorn-type designers can seem futile, the challenge is real and these new generation designers play a key role in modern successful businesses. Massive IT investments are gradually turning into more iterative processes where using a multitude of tightly segmented designers is no longer cost-effective. The role of a single designer is getting more significant and the required skills must adapt to the situation.', 'Transforming an existing T shape into a pi shape requires a good deal of work and effort, but in the end it is a favor for both your own career and the industry. Having multiple adjacent core skills is the only way of offering only the best to the clients regardless of the scale of the project. It also ensures better access to an even wider career path in the future.', 'Design should always serve a greater purpose. It is an inseparable part of a larger effort to change how services and products work and are used. In the end, design is just one part of the process that leads to an end product. This is why it must adapt to the implementation model in use. Even though the current model seems to prefer smaller teams, requiring skillful performance and continuous delivery from every member, the underlying purpose is eventually about reaching a common goal with solid teamwork.', 'Designers don‚Äôt work in a vacuum with just their individual skills in use. In a supportive and transparent work culture, variations in individual skill levels become less significant and the combined expertise of employees aggregates. When people are eager to share their knowledge and are not afraid of making mistakes, the end result is often much more than any team member could achieve alone. Even when people are expected and encouraged to work independently and as multidisciplinarily as possible, it doesn‚Äôt mean that every individual should be able to do everything by themselves.', 'Growing a second stem needs both courage and an opportunity. As it is the designer‚Äôs challenge to stay curious and pro-active, it is just as important that the work environment keeps the effort nourished and blossoming.', 'Be brave, take your chances, and you will be rewarded. :)']",[]

The library in focus is named jobba. Using jobba we can fetch resources from backend servers in a functional way. Unfortunately jobba isn\'t open sourced (neither is Twitter\'s Stitch), but at least this ""documentation"" is public now.', 'TL;DR this is not a monad tutorial', ""Jobba is very similar to Facebook's Haxl and Twitter's Stitch."", 'To access backend resources, we could build a small library using Scala‚Äôs Future directly. But is Scala\'s Future (or JavaScript\'s Promises) functional? This question is immediately followed by a meta-question: What do we mean by ""functional""? If functional means that we have map, filter and reduce, then ‚Äî yes ‚Äî Future is a functional construct. Yet the defining property of functional programs is the referential transparency, a property which enables us to reason equationally. Fancy words need examples:', 'If we start with a very simple example', ""and ask ourselves, are the first and the third elements of the list l the same? If f is referentially transparent then we'll have"", ""and the answer is: yes, as f(true) == f(true) always. Scala doesn't enforce referential transparency, so we can't be a hundred percent sure. But most likely, functions from Booleans to Ints are referentially transparent."", 'But can we reason similarly about a program involving Futures?', 'Can we be sure that, in the resulting list, the first and third values will always be the same (if b resolves successfully)? This is a trick question: the answer is ‚Äúit depends‚Äù. If we manually evaluate the expression:', 'we see that the first and the third elements should be the same, and they will be if foo is a val. But if foo is defined as def foo = webClient.get(""http://my.backend/api/foo""), then not only may the results vary, but two requests will be made to the same endpoint. And contrary to the previous example, Future-computations usually do have these kinds of side effects.', ""In this small example the issue is easy to work around. But try to imagine a larger system, with a very granular backend API, where one has to make hundreds of backend requests to compose the final result. Let's take Twitter as an example: you can fetch a user's feed, where each tweet has an author, and you can fetch each author's information, to get an avatar URL. You'd like the rendered feed (the result) to be consistent, i.e. each author always has the same avatar. Or going even further: you'd like to make as few backend requests as possible. Your API might even support fetching multiple users' information with a single request. You'd like to leverage that, but you don't want to sacrifice the clarity of your code. So you could take it all into account manually:"", ""And that's ok. But then you'd like to render two users' feeds on top of each other. If you do"", 'you lose the desired property: consistent results (the referential transparency). Also you lose the property of making as few requests as possible. It is difficult to use multi-valued requests and have composable code.', ""Rather you'd like to write more granular code, and have the above properties:"", ""How to proceed is actually quite obvious, if you are familiar with the common FP design practices. The Future isn't a pure construction, but merely a functional looking wrapper to side-effectful callback-based operations. The Future isn't composable in the way we want it to be. We want to separate the what and the how of backend access. Let frontend developers specify what to fetch and what to do with results, and backend developers how to fetch it. Plain Future doesn't work, so we just add another level of abstraction by introducing a new type, Job:"", 'Here we already implicitly decided that the Job and Future API should be similar. The difference is that, we first construct a Job computation and then execute it. This is contrary to Future, where construction and execution are highly interleaved.', 'With the separation of construction and execution, frontend / application developers could compose Jobs (specify the what). Backend developers could work on the implementation of the execute method ‚Äî the how. The implementation will be written in a referentially transparent way, also automatically optimising the execution.', 'What is the trick, one might ask? It‚Äôs the primitive building blocks. With Future you could do virtually everything, but with Job you can only ask for a JSON document from the backend. By restricting what a Job can do, the implementation can be made fully referentially transparent, as explained later.', 'Jobba, Haxl, and Stitch are very similar libraries. Yet there are a couple of differences worth pointing out, if you are already familiar with them.', 'Haxl is a Haskell library by Facebook with which you can:', 'Stitch is a Scala library by Twitter with which you can do almost the same:', ""Unluckily Stitch isn't open source. And it doesn't have the soundness and modularity property, which is another way to say that the execution is referentially transparent. So there are already three reasons to make our own library: we use scala (rules out Haxl), want referential transparency and a library we can use (rules out Stitch)."", ""Also our environment was a bit simpler. We didn't have a batch API, and we have only a single source type: JSON over HTTP. And we take advantage of that, as it simplifies internals. So Jobba is a Scala library by us with which you can:"", ""The implementation of Job uses the same approach as Haxl or Stitch: Free Monad. There are good explanations of free monads and free structures in general on StackOverflow, so I won't repeat them."", ""The idea is to make a data type that has all the needed operations, but doesn't perform anything. Then the executor (evaluator or interpreter) will take the description of the computation and execute it."", 'This problem is quite similar to the Par example in Chapter 4 of Functional Programming in Scala. We abstract even more, though. Using free monads we could have totally different implementations of our execute method. In the Par example, the authors had to change the definition of the Par data type to provide a fully non-blocking Par implementation using actors.', 'One simple definition of Job could be:', 'Then we could implement the primitive operations of the Job API:', 'Here we already perform some local optimisations of the syntax structure we build up.', 'Unfortunately, to make for-comprehensions work, we need to define map and flatMap as member methods of Job. So the real definition of the Job trait is more interleaved:', 'After we have defined the Job data structure, we could look what the singleTweet Job will look like:', 'As map is implemented using flatMap we see a BlockedJob as an outer constructor of the resulting job.  is an anonymous unary function we make in flatMap.', ""Next, let's write a simple executor, we simply squash Job into Future, PureJob into Future.successful and BlockedJob into Future.flatMap:"", 'The execution of FetchJob is the place where the magic starts to happen. We could simply perform the actual fetch for every FetchJob, but what we really do is we cache FetchJobs as we go:', 'Using this we get soundness and modularity. Yet skeptics will notice that we could rewrite the original singleTweet as:', 'or', 'and get the same benefits. And that is very true. For example in our application we have three caches: app-global in-memory, Redis cache for backend responses, and request-local in-memory cache for consistency. All these three could be implemented using an implicit context, as they only affect how a fetch operation is performed.', 'The type Job[+A] = JobbaContext => Future[A] definition, which resembles the Par implementation, would work as well as the implicit contexts: not well enough.', ""Using Futures directly, and implicits, we cannot affect the structure of the computation. We can't change the structure of the computation built with Futures. We can't bundle multiple fetches into one, to e.g. leverage Redis' MGET command. To achieve that, we must make the Job structure richer and add a few more job-types:"", ""The MapJob is quite simple: it's there to expose the map operation directly, not via pure and flatMap. The PairJob needs more explanation. If we continue with a simpler Job definition for a moment, and try to build a concurrent Job:"", 'Here we would expect to see FetchJob(/user/futurice) too, as clearly we could perform both fetches concurrently, or even bundled into one. Applicative Functors come to the rescue. We need to modify the twoTweets definition (using scalaz magical operators):', 'Using this we actually do worse at first:', ""Let's define ap in Applicative using PairJob, i.e. remember that we composed Jobs applicatively. Then we'll see more of the computation's original structure:"", 'At this point we can redo the executor ‚Äî totally change its execution strategy. Make it first traverse the job structure, picking up all visible FetchJobs. Then we can bundle fetches together into a single Redis MGET command. After that, replace FetchJobs with results wrapped into PureJobs, simplify the structure of the job and loop, until we have only a single PureJob at hand! We call this executor OnionExecutor, because it peels the structure off, making the job smaller and smaller at every iteration.', ""Let's work the two tweets job step-by-step:"", ""There weren't any BlockedJobs in the example job above. That means that we could render these two tweets using a single iteration of the executor loop, a single MGET ‚Äî as we did!"", ""In the real version of Job we also have FailedJob, because sometimes things go wrong, but that's all."", 'Above I showed you how one can construct a powerful computation abstraction using free structures. Essentially we made an embedded language (which in turn embeds a host language to do pure computations!) to do asynchronous resource retrievals. We have more control over the execution than when using Futures directly and more importantly the execution strategy, we used, is referentially transparent.

You can compare it to its React counterpart.', 'MVI is a unidirectional data flow architecture with Virtual DOM for rendering, just like React/Flux is. But the similarities end there, and MVI is different for the following reasons.', 'Purely Reactive. React mixes Reactive programming patterns with Interactive programming patterns, whenever it makes use of imperative APIs such as setState, forceUpdate, setProps, render. Flux attempts to be reactive by making Stores listen to Dispatcher events, and Controller-Views listen to Store events. However, the centralized Dispatcher is imperatively controlled by Actions, rather than taking the responsibility to observe Actions. Also, Actions are imperatively created at Views. MVI has a consistent reactive approach, making it easy to reason how any component is internally structured.', 'MVI is decentralized. Flux has a centralized Dispatcher, and the guidelines recommend that it is kept always singleton in the application. This leads to typical centralization problems such as unmaintainability of a large file as the application grows. The Dispatcher is actually an event plumber, connecting all the parties related to events, in a style not that different to a centralized Event Bus. In the MVI structure described here, inter-model dependencies can be easily described separately in each Model: whenever Model X depends on events from Model Y and Model Z happening first, then X simply internally defines that it depends on Y and Z.', 'Leverages the power of RxJS. While Flux suggests using the low-level EventEmitter which requires manual event handling, RxJS and similar event processing tools are powerhouses capable of replacing a lot of boilerplate that a typical Flux application contains. RxJS also allows the internal structure of a component to be reactive.', 'Renderer separated from View. By separating View logic from View rendering, the application has more separation of concerns, and the View becomes more testable and replaceable. Since the Renderer is modular and never referenced by any other component, one can also play with different implementations of the Renderer and easily swap between them. In a Renderer, you can even have post-processing steps over the View Observables, modifying the elements or wrapping them in a container div. This makes it easy to implement UI skins, for instance. These modular capabilities do not exist in React.', 'More testable. Every component in MVI, except side-effects such as the Renderer, are function-like since they are free of side-effects and receive input, generating output. This is an ideal situation for automated tests, specially when the View logic can be tested outside of a browser context, where test execution is faster.', ""Less coupled. Interactive patterns, often found in React/Flux, immediately imply more coupling between the parts. For instance, Actions import the Dispatcher and explicitly affect it, hence making it harder to replace the Dispatcher with another, if needed. MVI has separation of concerns in its core since it follows reactive programming principles strictly. You can even insert a mediator between the Model and the View or between any other two reactive modules, since they shouldn't need to explicitly import each other. Each component in the MVI cycle is agnostic to the input component it is given in the dependency injection system, as long as the input satisfies an expected interface."", 'virtual-dom is faster than React. Preliminary benchmarks show that rendering run with virtual-dom is faster than in React and other frameworks. I have yet to see React (as a Virtual DOM rendering tool) perform better than\xa0virtual-dom.', 'Models observe other Models. Flux dictates that inter-model dependency should live in the Dispatcher, but in MVI, those dependencies are defined inside each Model.', 'No internal state. MVI is comparable to React implementations that only use properties (no state). Views should not contain internal state, since that would violate the View concern, which is simply to render a virtual element. In MVI, all state should live in the Model, even those that are purely UI related. This is more of a recommended practice, rather than a limitation, since one has freedom to implement state in MVI Views. This is related to the next point.', 'No reusable UI components. React has a strong emphasis on ""reusable UI components"", which is unmatched in this current MVI proposal. The focus in MVI is to enable separation of concerns with function-like modules. Currently, achieving proper reusable UI components in MVI is still an open problem. That\'s because a React View component can contain all three Model, View, and Intent responsibilities. I believe the ideal solution to this will be the advent of Web Components inside the context of a Virtual DOM. Ideally, we should virtually render a custom-element, with its own internal state and complex behavior, just like we do with any other div. For a lengthy discussion on these possibilities, read more from our brilliant Jarno Rantanen.', 'Model-View-Intent might evolve into a framework, or might not require enough boilerplate to justify a framework. Problems are yet to be discovered. Currently, the biggest challenge is encapsulating a UI component with its behavior, for reuse. We are anxious to see what Web Components will enable together with a Virtual DOM.', 'I strongly recommend frontend developers to try virtual-dom before picking up React. Its API is minimal, and it only does one thing, so the rest of the work is good old Do-It-Yourself JavaScript with little code. In my opinion it is more faithful to the promise ""Just the UI"" than React is. virtual-dom throws instructive errors in the event of invalid input, and there are some very useful libraries built specifically for virtual-dom.', 'Another crucial tool is RxJS, which makes it possible to avoid writing low-level event utilities that other frameworks have to provide. It often almost removes the need to have a framework in the first place.', 'Model-View-Intent is just an experiment that seems to be working. Unidirectional data flow with the Virtual DOM certainly exists outside the context of React and Flux. There are many possible variations of this architecture, and as frontend technologies normally go, this might evolve significantly in the future.

The injection of `final` is also used in other places, such as in method arguments, by default.

Just think about the sheer amount of keyboard typing needed just to make an anonymous inner class for a click listener. IDEs make it easy by inferring what you want and inserting code for you.

Although measurements could be better evidence, we believe developing in Xtend was quicker than in Java, and to some extent, safer against null pointer exceptions.

So, why bother?', 'Just like there is a point in idea generation sessions, there is a point to a wedding. A wedding is a special event that lets the social circles of the bride and groom (or bride and bride, or groom and groom) to know each other, especially the other half of the couple. A traditional wedding might feel corny with its traditional roles, costumes, phrases, flowers etc. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, the process makes sure that all the relevant people know that this relationship is serious and important. Also, a wedding gives a permission to say positive (and embarrassing) things about the couple, and the wedding becomes a focal point for the families and friends to form new social connections. If there is no wedding, there is a risk of missing some of these important things that make up and shape our relationships to our friends and family.', 'An organised session for generating new ideas does not guarantee a successful service, but as a ritual, it ensures that some important things are accounted for. In an idea generation session all people involved get an opportunity to contribute, and the session is finally the place and time to focus on solutions (unlike in the beginning where the focus should be on the customers and their problems). The session is also the place and time where it is permitted to be creative and crazy, the session is when we push ourselves outside our conventional thinking. If the session has been a good one, after the session the people involved have a shared understanding, and importantly, after the session people are often more committed to take things forward.', 'If we decide to skip a brainstorming session in service or product development, it is not the end of the world. Perhaps some more conservative colleagues might get grumpy for not sticking to traditions. However, if we skip a brainstorming session, then we should consider how do we make sure we are not skipping over the benefits of the ritual. Often it is much more convenient to hold a brainstorming session for new ideas and follow the best practices to make sure all things are covered. Otherwise some of our colleagues, clients, partners, and stakeholders might be left with an empty feeling.', 'At the end of the day, it is the end result that matters both in product design and in relationships. The world is full of examples in which people did not follow rituals and conventions, but nevertheless had good ideas/relationships. All that matters is that we know what we are doing and why ‚Äì whether it is idea generation or weddings.', 'Perhaps less sticky notes and more champagne in weddings, though.']",[]

', 'It‚Äôs quite common to hear people complaining about bad usability and user experience of B2B and enterprise applications. There are also user studies showing that B2B websites suffer from poor usability compared to mainstream consumer sites. In today‚Äôs digitalized world, the users of B2B systems use a lot of consumer websites and mobile applications in their leisure time and this makes their UX expectations higher towards the B2B systems, too. Still, designing B2B systems differs from designing consumer websites and mobile applications. In this post I‚Äôll highlight couple of reasons why.', 'While designing B2B systems, business and domain understanding are critical ingredients of the design work. After all, in a professional context, the main purpose of the UI is to support the user in achieving some specified business goals. The goal might be to maximize the productivity of a factory, to speed up the billing process or to enhance customer support. In each B2B context, the designer should be fully aware of the business needs the system tries to solve. In addition, understanding the domain is crucial as in B2B systems there are typically plenty of domain specific features and terminology with which the users are familiar. The customer is typically an expert in the business domain and the designer needs to listen to the customer carefully to gain as much domain understanding as possible while still bringing to the table his/her own UX expertise. The ideal solution lies in the combination of business, domain and UX expertise.', 'B2B systems often have multiple different user groups with differing needs. The majority of the users are likely to be professional/power users who use the system on a daily basis. However, there are still users with less experience who should also be taken into account, such as new employees and occasional users. B2B systems are often designed to support all possible user groups and thus contain whole lot of features, many of which may not be relevant for all users. In order to improve the UX of the system, it is important to thoroughly figure out all the different user groups and their specific needs vis-√†-vis the system. For example,,it is possible to use smart user authentication to \xa0reveal features only to those user groups that actually need them. \xa0This is one of the good practices that can make the system easier to learn and remember for the new and occasional users.', 'B2B systems are seldom created from scratch. Typically, there is a legacy system with existing users, who are familiar with it and can cope with its limitations and difficulties. This is challenging from the design point of view, because existing users are reluctant to change anything in their work and typically consider any new tool worse than the old one due to the fact that they have gotten used to the old way of doing things. It‚Äôs difficult to dig out the problems the users have with the legacy system, because they want to feel competent in their work and do not want to admit that they have problems. Additionally, the users are often so used to certain cumbersome tasks that they don‚Äôt identify them as problems. B2B systems are often used along with other systems, like office applications, email systems, reporting tools etc. and accomplishing some work task may actually require using an array of applications to complete the task. Launching and using other applications inevitably causes some breaks in the UX, but often there is no way to avoid these kind of UX complications, because it would not be feasible to develop a tool that contains the features of all possible applications needed in the work context. The designer of a B2B system should carefully consider which tasks are handled within the system and which in some other tool and make the transitions to and from that other tool as smooth as possible.', 'B2B systems are used in the working environment, where the user has clear goals and should be productive as soon as possible. Thus, designing for B2B systems is not so much about attracting and entertaining the user, but about efficiency and effectiveness. It‚Äôs important to ensure, that the system is useful, i.e. has the features that are needed by each user group, nothing more and nothing less. Basic usability principles for learnability, memorability, error prevention and recovery, efficiency and satisfaction are especially important in the B2B context. Obviously, the work process also affects the user‚Äôs efficiency and sometimes the work process needs to be re-designed along with the tools. The most radical UX and productivity improvements often happen in the process side rather than in the tool UI. New UX methodology is needed in order to gather thorough understanding of existing processes and the process pain points.', 'The lifecycle of a B2B system is typically much longer than that of a consumer solution. This has a significant impact, especially on the visual design of the system. When designing a B2B system, which might be used for 15 to 20 years, the graphic designer should not go with the latest trends, which may look old-fashioned in a few years. The visual design should aim at creating a timeless, \xa0lasting style, which looks like a natural and professional continuation of the legacy system. In addition, in B2B systems, the visual design should be first and foremost functional and focused on supporting the user‚Äôs cognitive processes (such as, focus of attention, learning, reasoning, problem solving and decision making). In the interaction design side, the designer must carefully asses the legacy system and its usage to figure out which interactions should be kept intact to keep the system usable for existing users and which should be changed to make the learning process easier for new and occasional users. Long lifecycle also means that strong product and UX ownership is needed during the product lifecycle in order to avoid feature creep i.e. always adding more and more new features on top of the existing stuff.', 'Sometimes B2B systems consist of both software and hardware components. Also, the context of use may bring some special requirements to the design. The designer of the B2B system should be aware of the constraints of the hardware like memory capacity, availability of network connections, and cabin ergonomics etc. \xa0The designer should also understand the impact of the context of use; the system may be used in moist, dusty , dark or cold conditions, user may have a helmet and gloves on and all of these factors should be \xa0taken into account while making the design decisions.', '\nContext of use, hardware + tablet UI of Tana SmartSite, developed in co-operation with Futurice\u200b', 'While the design work in the B2B context should focus on the usefulness and usability first, the designer should definitely not forget about aesthetics. The user interface along with the HW design needs to catch the buyers‚Äô attention in trade shows, where the buyers of B2B systems typically evaluate different options. There‚Äôs likely to be a lot of competing products present and the UI should really stand out to create a memorable experience and make the buyer remember the product even after the trade show. Aesthetics matter in the actual work as well, as visually appealing and attractive UI makes the users want to use the system and keeps them better motivated. The visuals can be used to focus the users attention on the most important issues at that given time. On the other hand, the visuals should not take too much attention to distract the user from the actual tasks. There may be different requirements for the visuals depending on the different contexts of use, for example user interfaces used in dark conditions require different kind of visual style than interfaces used in normal or bright lighting conditions. \xa0 All in all, designing B2B systems is more complex than designing consumer products. There are many factors affecting the design and a thorough study of end users and their needs is required in order for the design to be successful. In the next post I‚Äôll talk more about why B2B companies should care about UX and in the third part of the trilogy I will discuss how the design work could be done in B2B context in order to maximize the design benefits.']",[]

","['Anomaly detection spots unexpected patterns in logs', 'Experiment: Processing logs with Prelert Anomaly Detective', 'Challenges and conclusions', 'More to explore']","['An important part of creating successful digital services is the ability to monitor system‚Äôs health and to respond to exceptional situations in a timely fashion. Log files contain information that a maintainer needs in figuring out causes for application failures or unexpected behavior.', 'However, it is often difficult for a human to identify the explanations even if all the necessary information is in principle available in the logs because today‚Äôs applications are so complex and consist of several interconnected software components. Luckily there are tools that can help. IT operation analytics is a field that uses statistical and data mining techniques to let computers do the hard work of detecting and analysing important events in the application logs. Mining insights from logs leads to better and more maintainable software.', 'On this blog post, I focus on one particular kind of tool: log anomaly detection. An anomaly detection software monitors logs for unexpected patterns and alerts the maintainer if something abnormal is detected. The anomaly detectors use statistical methods to analyze the logs so that there is no need for a maintainer to define what is considered normal behavior in advance. Instead, the tool learns \xa0patterns of what kind of log messages typically appear under normal conditions. It then continues to track incoming log messages and alerts the maintainer if something unexpected is detected. An anomaly detection algorithm can track either numerical values extracted from the logs or frequencies of log messages. Equipped with the exact knowledge of what is abnormal in the logs, the maintainer can then hopefully track down the reason for the anomaly easily.', 'The usual approach without automatic tools is to identify a set of measures to track and to write down scripts that send alerts when an observed value exceed a static threshold. For example, an alert could be set to fire if the amount of incoming traffic per hour on a site is larger than a predefined value as in the figure below.', '', 'Static thresholds, however, are difficult to calibrate. If the threshold is set too low, false alerts will be generated (perhaps the peak on day 2 in the figure is completely normal operation?). If, on the other hand, the threshold is too high, not all abnormal events are detected. A static threshold also fails to notice the strange slump in the middle of day 1.', 'Anomaly detection automatically learns a baseline, or a typical pattern of events, by inspecting the logs, and is able to infer dynamic thresholds. A simplified example of dynamic thresholds is shown in the figure below. The shaded band between the red lines shows the region where the values are expected to land. Now, the day 1 slump crosses the lower threshold and is thus detected. In fact, an anomaly detection model can be even more flexible than the figure shows. Instead of fixed thresholds, a model can estimate the probability of each new observation given the similar situations in the past, and raise an alert if the new observation is very unlikely.', '', 'Another benefit of automatic anomaly detection is that it is possible to find unexpected events, whereas matching against pre-written rules is only ever able to find things the developer anticipated (the developer has not been able to write detection rules for unanticipated events!). At its best, an anomaly detection algorithm might even notice unexpected changes before a serious problem develops.', 'I experimented with a program called\xa0Prelert Anomaly Detective\xa0by using it to process logs of a project. It uses machine learning methods to identify anomalies in the logs in real-time. Prelert is not the only tool for the task;\xa0Sumo Logic\xa0and\xa0Google Analytics Intelligence Events\xa0are some of the other tools capable of detecting unexpected patterns in logs.', 'There are several options for getting the log files into Prelert. One can manually upload logs or set up a scheduled task to download logs from a remote server. Prelert automatically detects timestamps, and can summarize data by grouping similar log messages together. A developer can also ask Prelert to extract numerical or textual values from log messages for further analysis. Prelert helps in this task by constructing regular expressions from examples.', 'After the parsing is finished, one can tell Prelert to analyse the logs and to learn a baseline. As far as I can tell (there is not much documentation available), Prelert‚Äôs baseline consists of a mean value and typical variation in a time window. Prelert‚Äôs main task is detecting large deviations that do not fit in the learned baseline (e.g. fewer than expected of certain kind of log messages). Prelert computes an ‚Äúanomaly score‚Äù, which is an abstract measure of the magnitude of the deviation at the given time window. The anomaly score is plotted on a timeline to visualize when potential anomalies have occurred. The detection can be done as an ad-hoc analysis on historical data or in real-time as more logs come in. In the latter mode, the system sends emails to the maintainer as soon as deviations happen.', '', 'The figure above shows Prelert‚Äôs anomaly timeline for back-end server logs. There are three clear peaks between November 12 and 18 showing that something unexpected has happened. The red lines below the graph show log lines with the largest deviations from the expected during the selected point in time (i.e. the log messages that are the reason for the deviation). All of the lines are related to database connection errors, and, indeed, during the time in question there was a problem with the database that caused connection failures under a heavy load.', 'There are some challenges in using automated log analysis methods. An important issue is reliability: can one trust that the program has detected all the important events? Secondly, although anomaly detection tools automate some parts of the log analysis, manual work and understanding of the system is still required in setting up and understanding the detected anomalies.', 'Anomaly detection is just one of the interesting statistical methods that can help a maintainer. Intrusion and fraud detection use similar techniques to discover possible security breaches or otherwise suspicious user behavior from the logs. Predictive analytics predicts how a system will behave in the future, and can forecast, for example, the need to allocate more hard drive space before the current capacity is exceeded. Root cause analysis tries to pinpoint which software component is responsible for causing a failure.', 'The anomaly detection tools can help developers to understand application behavior by making sense of application logs. Automatic learning of baselines and detection of unusual deviations aim to decrease maintainer‚Äôs workload in monitoring logs. The ability to react to abnormal conditions faster, even before they cause failures, leads to more resilient software. Overall, the anomaly detection and other log analysis methods seem great tools\xa0for finding bugs and other error conditions with a small effort. This will eventually lead to higher quality software.']","['Anomaly detection from server log data, a case study by VTT', 'System log analysis using InfoSphere BigInsights', 'Anomaly Detection Using The Adobe Analytics API']"

How should Rx be incorporated into mobile applications (with RxJava for Android or Rx.NET in mind)? ', 'I learned from my first dive into Rx that one should not go all-in immediately. It has fundamental changes on how data should be stored, fetched, and modified, especially if you are used to creating traditional event-driven application architectures which assume that model and controller code run on the UI-thread, with additional worker threads doing intensive\xa0processing and I/O. When applying Rx to your apps, I would start off by using it at the extremities first while keeping your precious model code traditionally imperative until you are more comfortable with the fundamentals.', 'If, like most apps, you need to make HTTP requests to fetch data, this would be a good starting point for switching to Rx‚Äôs Observables. It removes the need to deal with threading and synchronization while still providing fully asynchronous behavior. It is very simple to wrap an Android HttpURLConnection in an Observable when using\xa0RxJava for Android.', 'If, however, you are developing for Windows Phone 8 or Windows 8, using TPL (Task Parallel Library) may be the preferred approach, especially since the platform APIs have been designed to provide asynchronous goodness with pretty much just an ‚Äúawait‚Äù keyword. In this case, think about what you are trying to achieve. Is the result of your operation an enumerable? If so, then use Rx to represent it as a stream of data. If your result is just a singular return value or void, then perhaps TPL provides all you need (see discussion\xa0here). But I would go a step further here and say just wrap your Task in an Observable. Your interfaces will remain consistent and your calling code can declaratively handle the results of the task using Rx functions. The same argument applies for replacing AsyncTasks in Android with Observables.', 'Once you have dipped your foot in with external sources of data, you can start replacing imperative with declarative code at the other extreme, the view and the controllers. Bart De Smet gives a very nice example in\xa0one of his talks about Rx. He uses a textbox to trigger searches for word suggestions from the web using the contents of the textbox as the search query. This is a very common functionality in mobile apps. The code to handle changes in the textbox goes like this in C# (slightly modified):', 'What do we achieve with this? We transform a TextChanged event using FromEventPattern() to grab the current contents of the textbox with Select() every time the user inputs a character. Then we Throttle() that stream of data to emit the contents of the textbox at most every half a second to avoid flooding the server with unnecessary requests. Finally, we call DistinctUntilChanged() which makes sure we never send the same string of characters twice in a row (another unnecessary request). We can deduce the intent much easier from this declarative code than we could from its imperative counterpart, where we would be forced to use callbacks, timers, cancellation, and string comparisons shotgun sprayed all over our code file. The Java example would differ a bit, as we would need replace the FromEventPattern() call with a custom observable which wraps a textbox listener.', 'With the extremities Rx-ified, let‚Äôs see what we can accomplish by making our models a bit more reactive. Consider the diagram below. There is a view that contains a list, and this list reflects a collection of data items in your model. Normally you would fetch the current list of data when constructing the view, then listen to changes in that model, such as the addition of a data item.', '', 'What would happen if you convert getData() call to return an Observable instead? It would eliminate the need to conceptually separate the handling of the initial state and later modifications at the point of the Observer. You can consider the list of data as an infinite stream that you subscribe to, which sends the original list of items one by one and any later additional updates to any observer that subscribes to it. With RxJava, you could accomplish this at the view level with a simple (I‚Äôm cheating a bit and using lambda notation for brevity).', 'As soon as your model provides Observables, you can bring the whole power of Rx to play. Let‚Äôs say the items are emails in an inbox, and we want the list to display only the first 5 emails that have arrived from me@example.com. All this can be defined declaratively:', 'Now take the case where we are using the repository pattern to abstract away the source of our data as shown in the diagram below.', '', 'There is web service that provides an interface to get data items, and we have combined it with a cache that also stores some of those data items. If both data sources are implemented as Observables, we can simply define our repository to return a concatenation of both streams as follows', 'That code will first return the results from the cache, followed by results from the web service as a single stream of data. We can leave the code in our view as it was above, and it will function as expected.', 'I would encourage caution when starting to use Rx in model code, especially if you use Rx schedulers other than the UI thread. Before you go down this path, familiarize yourself more with functional programming principles. Depending on your needs, you may need to avoid side-effects as much as possible. When you ultimately do create side-effects you might need to protect yourself from race-conditions and ensure thread-safety with code of your own, and that is a high-risk proposition.', 'Reactive manifesto', 'Intro to Rx', 'RxJava github project', 'Blog post introducing RxJava by its creators']",[]

But it's not only about iterating on features, it's a framework for iterating on your whole business, especially when uncertainty is high.","['The heart of Lean Startup', 'Business development, not product development', 'Market fit', 'Minimum Viable Product (MVP)', 'The dedicated few', 'No one way, and never forever']","['A lot of people associate Lean Startup with Agile, which is great ‚Äì it is, after all, an Agile approach. Unfortunately, many people associate Agile only with software development. Lean Startup is not ‚Äúthat part of Agile‚Äù ‚Äì it is about building successful businesses.', 'As a framework, Lean Startup can be applied anywhere where uncertainty of the right action is high. The framework was originally built to support startups (a domain that naturally has high uncertainty), but can be used by established businesses as well. For example, Lean Startup is useful for developing new products or services, or expanding an existing business domain or customer base. Lean Startup has also been used in process improvement\xa0and governmental initiatives. For the rest of the article, when I talk about a startup, I don‚Äôt just mean actual startups, but also large organisations applying the framework to their innovations. Or anyone using Lean Startup.', 'The Lean Startup framework reminds us about the importance of recognizing that a lot of our beliefs about a product are assumptions. Some are more likely to be true, and others less likely, but they are still assumptions until we validate or invalidate them with appropriate feedback. Lean Startup also directs us to find out which of those assumptions are most critical to the success of the product, and test them as early as possible ‚Äì before we invest too much of our time and resources in the wrong product.', 'To map our assumptions, we build a business model canvas for our product. Lean Startup provides its own standard template ‚Äì the Lean Canvas ‚Äì which has been modified to contain fields that are particularly important for startups and early product ideas. Another canvas ‚Äì the Validation Canvas ‚Äì helps us design and track our experiments and validated assumptions. And if some critical assumption is invalidated, we return to the Lean Canvas to consider how we need to modify our business model in light of the new information. Rinse and repeat until the business has achieved a market fit (more on this below) and is well on its way to success ‚Äì or we run out of time or money.', 'The ‚Äúproduct‚Äù that Lean Startup develops is not the startup‚Äôs product or service, but rather the whole business around it. I see four distinct elements that must be considered and aligned with customers:', 'For startups, missing any one of the four areas means that the business will not be successful. Work on aligning all of them should start early. For example, it can be wise to charge money for the service or product from a very early date ‚Äì if people perceive the value and are willing to part with money for it (even when the product is still in its infancy), it validates a lot of assumptions related to the business model and can be used to test pricing.', 'The life of a startup can be said to consist of two stages - before market fit and after market fit. Market fit is the moment the four elements above ‚Äúclick together‚Äù, i.e. the four elements are aligned. That moment marks the transition from learning focus to scaling focus.', 'Before market fit, the business is still unproven and the focus of the startup is to learn what the product should really be. During this time, the business model is frequently updated to reflect the validated and invalidated assumptions. If a particularly critical assumption is invalidated, the startup may be forced to re-evaluate the whole business model and pivot to a different approach.', 'The primary question for this stage is ‚Äúhow many assumptions can we test before we run out of time or money?‚Äù The cheaper and faster the experiments can be run, the more times one can iterate on how to make the product successful. For real startups, money is usually the constraint that they run out of. For established businesses, it‚Äôs usually time. At this stage, the typical customers are early adopters who are generally willing to accept missing features or less comfortable use in exchange for being at the forefront of new ideas or services.', 'After market fit, the business has already proven its viability, and the focus switches to optimisation. Automating the service (to reduce costs) and scaling the product (to be able to serve more customers) become important. The product still needs to be improved since new customers are much less willing to accept incompleteness or poor quality of service. The success of experiments is usually measured in how the statistical behavior of customers changes (with e.g. A/B testing) rather than asking or observing individual customers.', 'For Lean Startup, every experiment is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In the very early stages, the MVP can be an interview of potential customers. Very quickly, though, the MVPs become more elaborate - visualisations, prototypes, manually delivered services, minimalistic product versions, partial feature releases, A/B tests, etc.', 'Experiments on pricing or customer acquisition approaches are also MVPs.', 'The MVPs are critical in getting feedback and refining the product. Speculation and lab testing is rarely as useful as getting real-life feedback from actual users, so startups must reach outside their premises (thus leading to popular Lean Startup quote: ‚ÄúGet out of the building!‚Äù). Interviews, user observation and statistical approaches are all used to gather ideas for improvement. Early on, delivering the product can also include a lot of manual steps, so a lot can be learned in the delivery process itself.', 'Early on in the life of a startup, it is usually much more important to find users that care for the product than to have a large user base. So, before addressing the needs of the early majority, find the innovators (and early adopters), and work with them to meet their needs.', 'Innovators are excited to be part of something new, and are willing to spend time to improve the idea with feedback. The large majority are much more likely to just drop, or ignore, the product at the first problem they encounter. The innovators are ready to answer questions and try out new features. And they are happy to suggest improvement ideas concerning features or the business model.', 'Also, if we cannot make the innovators excited about our product, how can we expect to excite the majority? If the innovators like your product, they will write / blog / tweet / talk about your product. And it‚Äôs these social leaders that the majority will follow. For most startups, such word-of-mouth marketing is invaluable.', 'Lots of users also generate lots of data. Lots of data can cloud issues, and it is challenging for the startup to filter out meaningful and important messages from all the noise. Quantitative metrics can help detect problems, but they will not tell why a problem exists. To ask questions, it‚Äôs easier for a startup to stay in touch with a small number of users versus communicating with a large group.', 'It‚Äôs obvious that every startup has something unique about their circumstances. Every startup must find their own way, and explore how to make their product work.', 'But that uniqueness does not devalue what Lean Startup teaches us about the nature of building new products or businesses. In contrast to traditional business plans, Lean Startup gives a living, flexible learning framework that helps the startup get started and quickly revise plans as feedback is received. For each startup, it acts as a guide to find the right questions, allowing them to find their own approach and answers.', 'In addition, it‚Äôs important to note that if the startup is successful and turns into an established business, things start changing. The organisation will have new challenges that Lean Startup isn‚Äôt even designed to answer, such as HR issues, organisational decision-making, or competence development. Other frameworks and ideas are needed. A lot of the company‚Äôs operation will become much more corporate-like.', 'And at some point, the organisation may note that it has new competitors who are lean and mean, and are biting at its heels with their innovative solutions. At these times, the incumbent organisations will need to re-establish pockets of innovation, possibly with Lean Startup‚Ä¶']","['Problem - Is the problem we perceive a genuine problem for the possible customers? Do they want it to be solved, and are they willing to part with something valuable (usually money) to have it solved? Who, within all potential customers, suffer enough from this problem to pay for a solution?', 'Solution - Does our envisioned service or product actually solve the problem? Does it solve the problem in a way the users want to use? Does the product or service meet the users‚Äô unstated requirements? Is the solution financially feasible considering the cost and effort it takes to deliver it?', 'Business model - How do we make the business financially viable (i.e. make more money than it spends)? How and how much do we charge for the product or service? Are users willing to pay that much or that way?', 'Customer acquisition - How do we connect with our customers? Do they understand our message? Do people understand the problem and how we solve it? Does our sales funnel work effectively?']"

By constantly challenging ourselves and our skills, the talents of Futurice people grow incessantly. Driven by people‚Äôs perfectionism, professionalism and eagerness, we have made knowledge sharing one of our key missions. Again it was time to share the love.', 'A couple of weeks ago, a series of talks inside Futurice called', 'that led on to hands-on workshops, were arranged, in turn, by front-end developers and designers. The idea of realising these workshops had been around for quite some time; an opportunity to learn from each other in order to become better professionals. And while these workshops were great for enhancing cross-disciplinary expertise and breaking out of professional boundaries, they have also once more fueled a debate that has been going on for years: generalists versus specialists.', 'I am writing these following thoughts from the perspective of a UX designer who has come to believe that designers that know how to code and developers who accumulate some design knowledge will communicate effectively and hence work more efficiently.', 'Considering the debate in general, it is fair to say that this debate is nothing new and has been actively discussed for years. Whereas specialization is arguably beneficial in developing one‚Äôs own professional core expertise (like the designer‚Äôs drive for true innovation and making the user central by identifying and solving user‚Äôs needs), designers and developers will face contradictions and conflicts in finding satisfactory, balanced compromises and solutions. A designer, whilst keeping a holistic project view, aims at creating proposals that consider usability and interaction constraints while being detached from solely technical ones. A seasoned UX designer should understand the intersection of these interdisciplinary elements and consider the bigger picture, looking after the users needs and wants at the same time. Actively and effectively working on resolving those possible conflicts is the way forward for efficient and successful collaboration.', 'So when it comes to UX designers, knowing what code does and knowing how to code are two very different things. Rather, we should consider that designers must know the capabilities and limits of the media they are designing for (Davide Casali). Knowing how to code certainly helps to build that knowledge. As designs go beyond static images and have functionality and multi-faceted responses and interactions built into them, current debates around responsive workflows (Stephen Hay) and the living web (Dan Chan) show that communication tools are outdated, often leaving developers confused about the designers‚Äô original intentions. And while ‚ÄòDesigners are not programmers‚Äô (Lukas Mathis), building interfaces instead of just picturing and explaining them ‚Äì and hence stepping closer towards each other through knowledge and skills enabling code-based prototypes \xad\xad‚Äì will improve communication and ensure better overall results from the development effort.', 'Designers who, by wanting to learn about code, have a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the media designed for, will more often than not make smarter choices. Front-end developers who seek a sensitivity and talent for crafting highly usable user interfaces and have a declared interest in creating a good user experience and learning about the work that goes ahead of the UI will also make smarter decisions. We believe the best results come from the friction of achieving complementary goals and the synergy of bringing those disciplines together effectively. At the end of the day, there are different layers of user experience, that sit on a continuum between the pixel and the person (Leisa Reichelt).', 'What it really comes down to is effective communication and collaboration. The goal is to have smart people effectively communicating with and understanding each other to produce a much better final product (Colin Barrett). Designers should be able to use code to communicate their designs and intentions in order to better collaborate with the people who build it.', 'So whether it‚Äôs for the love of pixels or the love of code, for designer and developers to know more about each other is necessary to make their individual contributions work together in magical ways. We believe in collaboration between smart people. We have a lot more work to do as there is a huge demand for even smarter collaboration between designers and developers, so we‚Äôll keep on sharing the love. Will you?']",[]

For example, almost on a daily basis, I receive applications where somebody sends me an email with just a phrase: ‚ÄùHere is my CV‚Äù. A CV tells what you have done, but it does not tell me who you are.', ""Personally, I find this really silly. I also do a lot of staffing (building teams for projects). At worst, this work is a big Excel exercise where you match project requirements with people‚Äôs skills. I very strongly believe that this is not enough.

If this happens, you would most likely not want to do that type of work anyway.', 'A good application contains a huge amount of information. You should have your CV, school and work records, letters of recommendation, work and people references and everything else that showcases your talents or what you want to do. When some of this information is missing, it creates extra work for the recruiter. Unfortunately, due to the thousands of applications that we get, the reality is that sometimes I do not have the time to request missing information from an otherwise promising candidate.', 'Furthermore, I have noticed that my decision whether an application is ‚Äùgood‚Äù or ‚Äùbad‚Äù is made almost immediately. If my feeling is that the application is good, then I review it properly. If it is ‚Äúbad‚Äù then I try to quickly find a reason why the person is not applicable so that I can close the case and move on.', 'Try to understand who is reading your application. For example, I sometimes read hundreds of applications a week. As a HR professional, I get my kicks from helping other people out. I absolutely love to interview people. On the other hand, reading through applications is something that I don‚Äôt like to do. In fact, I consider it a necessary evil of my work that is tedious and boring.

Someone who has personalized their application specifically for us is sending me the message that they are willing to spend more effort on something that I am proud of. This immediately makes me like the person. ;)', 'From another point of view, I receive a lot of applications that are clearly mailed to some mailing list or could easily be re-targeted by just changing the name of the recipient company. The feeling I always get from these is that the person does not care about us. My initial reaction is to respond back similarly (i.e. copy-paste a standard rejection letter). I have been discussing this with my colleagues here at Futurice and at other companies, and found that most recruitment professionals share my views.', 'The simplest and often most effective way to personalize your application is to tell why you want to work for the company.

Its job is to stand out and shout ‚ÄùPick me!‚Äù from a pile of applications.', 'However, I feel that this is an oversimplification. A job application is not just an advertisement of your skills. It should also convey your wishes and desires. It should shout ‚Äùpick me, if you are able to offer‚Ä¶!‚Äù.\xa0 Initially, you might think that this lowers your chances of getting through to interviews. This might even be true. However, ultimately it‚Äôs always you who accepts the job proposal! In other words, my job is to offer you something you want to do.

If you are willing to go anywhere, then state this. This is a minor detail when applying, but it helps companies with many locations (such as Futurice) out a lot . To be honest, this is more about ‚Äúmaking it easy‚Äù from my point of view.', 'This probably is the hardest part, but also the one where you can really make a difference! How can you prove yourself without physically meeting another person?', 'A good application is full of statements such as ‚ÄùI‚Äôm a team player‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am a fast learner‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am really passionate about this work‚Äù. As mentioned before, I like these, because they tell me who you are. Furthermore, I like to validate these when I am interviewing the person.', 'What I have learned is that most people are able to prove their statements ‚Äì many with really concrete proofs. I then often ask why they did not include these in their application. People felt that these are not part of a ‚Äústandard‚Äù application or that the validation is done during interviews anyway (as an application‚Äôs job is to get you through the door).', 'Ultimately, my job in recruitment is to find these concrete proofs. All the interviews and tests we conduct are actually a means to find them. Recruiting a new person always carries a big risk. Does the person fit into our culture, is he or she smart and gets things done, and fun to work with? Therefore, we cannot make an offer to a person before we are confident that we really understand who the person is, what he or she wants to do and is capable of. If you can already include these in your application, you are not only creating a very strong case for why I should meet you, you are also placing yourself much closer to a situation where we can give you a job offer.', 'I recommend that you give your application to somebody else and ask to identify all such statements. Then, go through every one and try to come up with a way to prove it. For example, if you say you have a passion for software development, submit links to your hobby projects or showcase how you participate in the software community. If you state that you are a fast learner, get a recommendation letter from your previous supervisor explaining how long it took you to learn something new.

Miten on mahdollista, ett√§ Suomi, joka on monilla mittareilla tietoyhteiskuntien edell√§k√§vij√§, tuntuu haaskaavan verorahoja ep√§onnistuneisiin tietotekniikan j√§ttihankkeisiin?', 'Kirjoituksessaan (HS Vieraskyn√§ 23.9.2011) Pekka Abrahamsson ja Mikkonen tuovat osuvasti esille keskeisen piirteen tietotekniikasta osana liiketoimintaa: tietotekniikka ei ole en√§√§ pelkk√§ tukitoiminto vaan yh√§ useammin liiketoiminnan ytimess√§. Kirjoittajat ehdottavat, ett√§ yritysten ei pid√§ ulkoistaa ydintoimintojensa tietotekniikan rakentamista, vaan tehd√§ asiat itse. T√§m√§ on kuitenkin usein helpommin sanottu kuin tehty. Onko esimerkiksi VR:n kaltaisen yrityksen j√§rkev√§√§ hankkia itselleen ja pit√§√§ itsell√§√§n tietoteknist√§ osaamista? Vai onko VR:n j√§rkev√§mp√§√§ ulkoistaa t√§m√§ osaaminen muualta ja tehd√§ tiivist√§ yhteisty√∂t√§ ohjelmistotoimittajien kanssa?', 'Viime aikaisten tietotekniikan kauhukertomusten taustalla olevat syyt eiv√§t ole siin√§, ett√§ ulkoistaminen olisi automaattisesti huono asia. Hyv√§ ulkoistaminen on yhteisty√∂t√§ ja kumppanuutta, eik√§ ydinosaamisen siirt√§mist√§ alihankkijan ratkaistavaksi. Ulkoistamisen sijaan julkisen sektorin ep√§onnistumisen syyn√§ on tietotekniikan nopea kehitys sek√§ julkishallinnon kilpailuttamiss√§√§nn√∂t.', 'Ep√§onnistumisten taustalla on 1990-luvulle j√§m√§ht√§nyt k√§sitys tietotekniikasta. VR:n lippuj√§rjestelm√§n sek√§ s√§hk√∂isten reseptien tapauksessa kyse on j√§ttim√§isist√§ projekteista ja kymmenien miljoonien investoinneista, jotka liukuvat j√§√§virran nopeudella harmittavan usein kohti ep√§onnistumisia. Tilanne on kuin kaksikymment√§ vuotta vanhasta tietotekniikan oppikirjasta, jossa hankkeille on tyypillist√§ paisuvat budjetit, kankeat toimintatavat, k√§ytt√§jien unohtuminen suunnittelussa ja kymmenien insin√∂√∂rien ryhm√§t ratkaisemassa oman alueensa ongelmia ilman k√§sityst√§ kokonaisuudesta.', 'Tietotekniikka on muuttunut merkitt√§v√§sti 1990-luvulta. Ohjelmistojen rakentamisen kynnys on madaltunut valtavasti ja nyky√§√§n l√§hes kuka tahansa voi alkaa ohjelmoida ja laittaa tuloksiaan myyntiin verkon sovelluskauppoihin. Kun nuorten muutaman hengen voimin rakentamista ohjelmista kasvaa maailmanlaajuisia, kuten suomalainen Habbo Hotel, niin on selv√§√§ ett√§ ohjelmistokehitys ei vaadi suuria alkuinvestointeja. Nopea ja kevyt rakentaminen tekee mahdolliseksi kokeilut ja muutokset, ja siten tietotekniikkaa voi suunnitella entist√§ enemm√§n k√§ytt√§jien ehdoilla. Lis√§ksi kun ohjelmoinnin ty√∂kalut ovat joko ilmaisia tai eritt√§in halpoja niin miljoonien budjetit ja vuosien aikataulut ovat historiaa ‚Äì tai ainakin niiden pit√§isi olla.', 'Tietotekniikan toimittajien maailmassa t√§m√§ muutos n√§kyy sukupolvenvaihdoksena niin sanotun vanhan koulukunnan ja uuden koulukunnan v√§lill√§. Vanhan koulukunnan edustajia ovat tyypillisesti suuret konsultti- ja alihankkijayritykset, jotka on perustettu vuosikymmeni√§ sitten. Uuden koulukunnan edustajat ovat 2000-luvun nuoria, joiden toimintatavat heijastavat nykyajan tietotekniikan ominaisuuksia: kevytt√§, nopeaa ja k√§ytt√§j√§l√§ht√∂ist√§ rakentamista, joka on edullista toteuttaa.', 'Uuden koulukunnan sukupolvi ja yrityskulttuuri on samaa kuin innovatiivisten startup-yritysten: ty√∂st√§ nautitaan ja korkea laatu sek√§ mutkaton toteuttaminen koetaan ammattiylpeyten√§. Ty√∂st√§ nauttimisen ja korkean ammattietiikan seurauksena on, ett√§ hankkeet onnistuvat l√§hes aina ja asiakastyytyv√§isyys on huippuluokkaa.', 'Julkishallinnon tietotekniikan hankkeiden p√§ivitt√§minen 2010-luvulle vaatii uuden tavan ajatella: pieni√§ matalan riskin projekteja, jotka kest√§v√§t kuukausia eik√§ vuosia, jotka maksavat murto-osan siit√§ mit√§ ennen, ja jotka valmistuessaan t√§ytt√§v√§t oikeasti k√§ytt√§jien tarpeet. T√§m√§ ajattelu mahdollistaa aivan uudenlaisen alihankinnan, esimerkiksi kilpailuttamalla useita toimittajia rinnakkain tai kokeilemalla mik√§ on paras mahdollinen vaihtoehto. Niill√§ investoinneilla, jotka esimerkiksi VR on laittanut lipunmyyntij√§rjestelm√§√§ns√§ olisi voinut rakentaa tusinan uuden koulukunnan j√§rjestelmi√§.', 'Mik√§ est√§√§ julkishallinnon organisaatioita siirtym√§st√§ tietotekniikassaan 2010-luvulle? Vastaus on kilpailuttamis- ja hankintas√§√§nn√∂t, jotka suosivat vanhan koulukunnan j√§ttihankkeita. Ja kuten Abrahamsson ja Mikkonen kirjoittavat, kiert√§√§kseen n√§m√§ s√§√§nn√∂t julkisen sektorin organisaatiot on pakotettu silppuamaan alihankintansa pieniksi paloiksi eri ohjelmistotoimittajille.', 'Vaikka uutisointi on viime aikoina keskittynyt kauhutarinoihin, ei t√§m√§ tarkoita, ett√§ kaikki julkisen sektorin toiminta olisi vanhanaikaista. Hyvi√§ vastaesimerkkej√§ ovat Helsingin seudun julkisen liikenteen mobiilikisa, jossa haettiin innovatiivisia uusia ideoita joukkoliikenteeseen, ja Sitran viimevuotinen uudenlainen rinnakkainen kilpailutus. Toivoa antavat my√∂s valtion entisen IT-johtajan, Yrj√∂ Bensonin puheet, joissa h√§n on per√§√§nkuuluttanut uusia ty√∂tapoja ja ty√∂kaluja valtion tietotekniikkahankintoihin.', 'Mutta jotain on pieless√§ julkisen sektorin j√§ttij√§rjestelmiss√§ ja j√§ttihankinnoissa, kun niit√§ katsoo rinnan muun tietotekniikan kehityksen kanssa. Suomeen on kasvanut Nokian seurauksena suuri m√§√§r√§ nuoria ja innovatiivisia tietotekniikan yrityksi√§ ja ammattilaisia, ja t√§t√§ lahjakkuutta tulisi voida hy√∂dynt√§√§ julkisen sektorin hankkeissa. Toisin sanoen, samaan aikaan kun kotimaisen raideliikenteen ja terveydenhuollon tietoj√§rjestelm√§t ep√§onnistuvat suomalainen Angry Birds valloittaa maailmaa. Milloin Suomelle tulee ensimm√§inen julkishallinnollinen tietoj√§rjestelm√§hitti kansainv√§lisille markkinoille? Tai edes kotimaisille?', 'Risto Sarvas, tekniikan tohtori, Futurice Oy ja Aalto-yliopistoKim Weckstr√∂m, yhteiskuntatieteiden lisensiaatti, Avaus Consulting Oy']",[]

We would build applications for the iOS, Android, Windows Phone 7 and Symbian^3 mobile platforms. Making the goal even more challenging was our hard deadline: the next Restaurant Day was three weeks away, on the 4th of February. With the different application store review processes, this meant that we would have to submit our applications by the end of the following week.', 'On Friday, we focused on design. After introductions, we had an ideation phase, followed by MoSCoW prioritisation by Jyrki, the Restaurant Day CTO and our official product owner.
